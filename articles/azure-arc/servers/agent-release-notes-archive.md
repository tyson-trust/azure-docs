- An issue preventing some users who tried authenticating with an identity from a different tenant than the tenant where the server is (will be) registered has been fixed.
- The `azcamgent check` command no longer validates CNAME records to reduce warnings that did not impact agent functionality.
- The agent will now try to obtain an access token for up to 5 minutes when authenticating with an Azure Active Directory service principal.
- Cloud presence checks now only run once at the time the `himds` service starts on the server to reduce local network traffic. If you live migrate your virtual machine to a different cloud provider, it will not reflect the new cloud provider until the service or computer has rebooted.
- Improved logging during the installation process.
- The install script for Windows now saves the MSI to the TEMP directory instead of the current directory.

## Version 1.22 - September 2022

Download for [Windows](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/5/135f1f2b-7b14-40f6-bceb-3af4ebadf434/AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi) or [Linux](manage-agent.md#installing-a-specific-version-of-the-agent)

### Known issues

- The 'connect' command uses the value of the last tag for all tags. You will need to fix the tags after onboarding to use the correct values.

### New features

- The default login flow for Windows computers now loads the local web browser to authenticate with Azure Active Directory instead of providing a device code. You can use the `--use-device-code` flag to return to the old behavior or [provide service principal credentials](onboard-service-principal.md) for a non-interactive authentication experience.
- If the resource group provided to `azcmagent connect` does not exist, the agent tries to create it and continue connecting the server to Azure.
- Added support for Ubuntu 22.04
- Added `--no-color` flag for all azcmagent commands to suppress the use of colors in terminals that do not support ANSI codes.

### Fixed

- The agent now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 servers that have FIPS mode enabled.
- Agent telemetry uses the proxy server when configured.
- Improved accuracy of network connectivity checks
- The agent retains extension allow and blocklists when switching the agent from monitoring mode to full mode. Use [azcmagent config clear](azcmagent-config.md) to reset individual configuration settings to the default state.

## Version 1.21 - August 2022

Download for [Windows](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/4/c/a4cce0a3-5830-4bd4-a4aa-a26794690e3d/AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi) or [Linux](manage-agent.md#installing-a-specific-version-of-the-agent)

### New features

- `azcmagent connect` usability improvements:
  - The `--subscription-id (-s)` parameter now accepts friendly names in addition to subscription IDs
  - Automatic registration of any missing resource providers for first-time users (extra user permissions required to register resource providers)
  - Added a progress bar during onboarding
  - The onboarding script now supports both the yum and dnf package managers on RPM-based Linux systems
- You can now restrict the URLs used to download machine configuration (formerly Azure Policy guest configuration) packages by setting the `allowedGuestConfigPkgUrls` tag on the server resource and providing a comma-separated list of URL patterns to allow.

### Fixed

### New features

- You can configure the agent to operate in [monitoring mode](security-overview.md#agent-modes), which simplifies configuration of the agent for scenarios where you only want to use Arc for monitoring and security scenarios. This mode disables other agent functionality and prevents use of extensions that could make changes to the system (for example, the Custom Script Extension).
- VMs and hosts running on Azure Stack HCI now report the cloud provider as "HCI" when [Azure benefits are enabled](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-benefits#enable-azure-benefits).

### Fixed

- `systemd` is now an official prerequisite on Linux
- Guest configuration policies no longer create unnecessary files in the `/tmp` directory on Linux servers
- Improved reliability when extracting extensions and guest configuration policy packages
- Improved reliability for guest configuration policies that have child processes

## Version 1.17 - April 2022

Download for [Windows](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/3/4/a34bb824-d563-4ebf-bcbf-d5c5e7aaf4a3/AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi) or [Linux](manage-agent.md#installing-a-specific-version-of-the-agent)

### New features

- The default resource name for AWS EC2 instances is now the instance ID instead of the hostname. To override this behavior, use the `--resource-name PreferredResourceName` parameter to specify your own resource name when connecting a server to Azure Arc.
- The network connectivity check during onboarding now verifies private endpoint configuration if you specify a private link scope. You can run the same check anytime by running [azcmagent check](azcmagent-check.md) with the new `--use-private-link` parameter.
- You can now disable the extension manager with the [local agent security controls](security-overview.md#local-agent-security-controls).

### Fixed

- If you attempt to run `azcmagent connect` on a server already connected to Azure, the resource ID is shown on the console to help you locate the resource in Azure.
- Extended the `azcmagent connect` timeout to 10 minutes.
- `azcmagent show` no longer prints the private link scope ID. You can check if the server is associated with an Azure Arc private link scope by reviewing the machine details in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_HybridCompute/AzureArcCenterBlade/servers), [CLI](/cli/azure/connectedmachine?view=azure-cli-latest#az-connectedmachine-show&preserve-view=true), [PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.connectedmachine/get-azconnectedmachine), or [REST API](/rest/api/hybridcompute/machines/get).
- `azcmagent logs` collects only the two most recent logs for each service to reduce ZIP file size.
- `azcmagent logs` collects Guest Configuration logs again.

## Version 1.16 - March 2022

Download for [Windows](https://download.microsoft.com/download/e/a/4/ea4ea4a9-a947-4c94-995c-52eaf200f651/AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi) or [Linux](manage-agent.md#installing-a-specific-version-of-the-agent)

### Known issues

- `azcmagent logs` doesn't collect Guest Configuration logs in this release. You can locate the log directories in the [agent installation details](agent-overview.md#agent-resources).

### New features

- You can now granularly control allowed and blocked extensions on your server and disable the Guest Configuration agent. See [local agent controls to enable or disable capabilities](security-overview.md#local-agent-security-controls) for more information.

### Fixed

- The "Arc" proxy bypass keyword no longer includes Azure Active Directory endpoints on Linux
- The "Arc" proxy bypass keyword now includes Azure Storage endpoints for extension downloads

## Version 1.15 - February 2022

Download for [Windows](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/7/4/074a7a9e-1d86-4588-8297-b4e587ea0307/AzureConnectedMachineAgent.msi) or [Linux](manage-agent.md#installing-a-specific-version-of-the-agent)

### Known issues

- The "Arc" proxy bypass feature on Linux includes some endpoints that belong to Azure Active Directory. As a result, if you only specify the "Arc" bypass rule, traffic destined for Azure Active Directory endpoints will not use the proxy server as expected.

### New features

- Network check improvements during onboarding:
  - Added TLS 1.2 check
  - Onboarding aborts when required networking endpoints are inaccessible
  - New `--skip-network-check` flag to override the new network check behavior
  - On-demand network check now available using `azcmagent check`
- [Proxy bypass](manage-agent.md#proxy-bypass-for-private-endpoints) is now available for customers using private endpoints. This feature allows you to send Azure Active Directory and Azure Resource Manager traffic through a proxy server, but skip the proxy server for traffic that should stay on the local network to reach private endpoints.
- Oracle Linux 8 is now supported

### Fixed

- Improved reliability when disconnecting the agent from Azure
- Improved reliability when installing and uninstalling the agent on Active Directory Domain Controllers
- Extended the device login timeout to 5 minutes
- Removed resource constraints for Azure Monitor Agent to support high throughput scenarios

### Fixed

- Fixed a state corruption issue in the extension manager that could cause extension operations to get stuck in transient states. Customers running agent version 1.13 are encouraged to upgrade to version 1.14 as soon as possible. If you continue to have issues with extensions after upgrading the agent, [submit a support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).

### Known issues

- Extensions may get stuck in transient states (creating, deleting, updating) on Windows machines running the 1.13 agent in certain conditions. Microsoft recommends upgrading to agent version 1.14 as soon as possible to resolve this issue.

### Fixed

- Improved reliability when installing or upgrading the agent.

### New features

- Local configuration of agent settings now available using the [azcmagent config command](azcmagent-config.md).
- Support for configuring proxy server settings [using agent-specific settings](manage-agent.md#update-or-remove-proxy-settings) instead of environment variables.
- Extension operations execute faster using a new notification pipeline. You may need to adjust your firewall or proxy server rules to allow the new network addresses for this notification service (see [networking configuration](network-requirements.md)). The extension manager falls back to the existing behavior of checking every 5 minutes when the notification service is inaccessible.
- Detection of the AWS account ID, instance ID, and region information for servers running in Amazon Web Services.

## Version 1.12 - October 2021

- GuestConfig agent support for US Gov Virginia region.
- GuestConfig agent extension report messages to be more verbose if there is a failure.

## Version 1.0 - September 2020

This version is the first generally available release of the Azure Connected Machine Agent.

### Plan for change

- Support for preview agents (all versions older than 1.0) will be removed in a future service update.
- Removed support for fallback endpoint `.azure-automation.net`. If you have a proxy, you need to allow the endpoint `*.his.arc.azure.com`.
- VM extensions can't be installed or modified from Azure Arc if the agent detects it's running in an Azure VM. This is to avoid conflicting extension operations being performed from the virtual machine's **Microsoft.Compute** and **Microsoft.HybridCompute** resource. Use the **Microsoft.Compute** resource for the machine for all extension operations.
- Name of guest configuration process has changed, from *gcd* to *gcad* on Linux, and *gcservice* to *gcarcservice* on Windows.

### New features

- Added `azcmagent logs` option to collect information for support.
- Added `azcmagent license` option to display EULA.
- Added `azcmagent show --json` option to output agent state in easily parseable format.
- Added flag in `azcmagent show` output to indicate if server is on a virtual machine hosted in Azure.
- Added `azcmagent disconnect --force-local-only` option to allow reset of local agent state when Azure service cannot be reached.
- Added `azcmagent connect --cloud` option to support other clouds. In this release, only Azure is supported by service at time of agent release.
- Agent has been localized into Azure-supported languages.

### Fixed

- Improvements to connectivity check.
- Corrected issue with proxy server settings being lost when upgrading agent on Linux.
- Resolved issues when attempting to install agent on server running Windows Server 2012 R2.
- Improvements to extension installation reliability

## Next steps

- Before evaluating or enabling Arc-enabled servers across multiple hybrid machines, review [Connected Machine agent overview](agent-overview.md) to understand requirements, technical details about the agent, and deployment methods.

- Review the [Planning and deployment guide](plan-at-scale-deployment.md) to plan for deploying Azure Arc-enabled servers at any scale and implement centralized management and monitoring.
