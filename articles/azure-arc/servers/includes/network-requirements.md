Azure Arc-enabled server endpoints are required for all server based Arc offerings. 

### Networking configuration

The Azure Connected Machine agent for Linux and Windows communicates outbound securely to Azure Arc over TCP port 443. By default, the agent uses the default route to the internet to reach Azure services. You can optionally [configure the agent to use a proxy server](../manage-agent.md#update-or-remove-proxy-settings) if your network requires it. Proxy servers don't make the Connected Machine agent more secure because the traffic is already encrypted.

To further secure your network connectivity to Azure Arc, instead of using public networks and proxy servers, you can implement an [Azure Arc Private Link Scope](../private-link-security.md) .

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Arc-enabled servers does not support using a [Log Analytics gateway](../../../azure-monitor/agents/gateway.md) as a proxy for the Connected Machine agent.

If outbound connectivity is restricted by your firewall or proxy server, make sure the URLs and Service Tags listed below are not blocked.

### Service tags

Be sure to allow access to the following Service Tags:

* AzureActiveDirectory
* AzureTrafficManager
* AzureResourceManager
* AzureArcInfrastructure
* Storage
* WindowsAdminCenter (if [using Windows Admin Center to manage Arc-enabled servers](/windows-server/manage/windows-admin-center/azure/manage-arc-hybrid-machines))

For a list of IP addresses for each service tag/region, see the JSON file [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â€“ Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). Microsoft publishes weekly updates containing each Azure Service and the IP ranges it uses. This information in the JSON file is the current point-in-time list of the IP ranges that correspond to each service tag. The IP addresses are subject to change. If IP address ranges are required for your firewall configuration, then the **AzureCloud** Service Tag should be used to allow access to all Azure services. Do not disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs, allow them as you would other Internet traffic.

For more information, see [Virtual network service tags](../../../virtual-network/service-tags-overview.md).

### URLs

The table below lists the URLs that must be available in order to install and use the Connected Machine agent.

### Transport Layer Security 1.2 protocol

To ensure the security of data in transit to Azure, we strongly encourage you to configure machine to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. Older versions of TLS/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) have been found to be vulnerable and while they still currently work to allow backwards compatibility, they are **not recommended**.

|Platform/Language | Support | More Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Linux | Linux distributions tend to rely on [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) for TLS 1.2 support. | Check the [OpenSSL Changelog](https://www.openssl.org/news/changelog.html) to confirm your version of OpenSSL is supported.|
| Windows Server 2012 R2 and higher | Supported, and enabled by default. | To confirm that you are still using the [default settings](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings).|
