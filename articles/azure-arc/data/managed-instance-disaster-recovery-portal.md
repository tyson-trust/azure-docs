# Configure failover group - portal

This article explains how to configure disaster recovery for Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance with Azure portal. Before you proceed, review the information and prerequisites in [Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance - disaster recovery](managed-instance-disaster-recovery.md).

[!INCLUDE [failover-group-prerequisites](includes/failover-group-prerequisites.md)]

To configure disaster recovery through Azure portal, the Azure Arc-enabled data service requires direct connectivity to Azure.

## Configure Azure failover group

1. In the portal, go to your primary availability group.
1. Under **Data Management**, select **Failover Groups**.

    Azure portal presents **Create instance failover group**.

1. Provide the information to define the failover group.

   * **Primary mirroring URL**: The mirroring endpoint for the failover group instance.
   * **Resource group**: The resource group for the failover group instance.
   * **Secondary managed instance**: The Azure SQL Managed Instance at the DR location.
   * **Synchronization mode**: Select either *Sync* for synchronous mode, or *Async* for asynchronous mode.
   * **Instance failover group name**: The name of the failover group.
  
1. Select **Create**.

Azure portal begins to provision the instance failover group.

## View failover group

After the failover group is provisioned, you can view it in Azure portal.

## Fail over

In the disaster recovery configuration, only one of the instances in the failover group is primary. You can fail over from the portal to migrate the primary role to the other instance in your failover group. To fail over:

1. In portal, locate your managed instance.
1. Under **Data Management** select **Failover Groups**.
1. Select **Failover**.

Monitor failover progress in Azure portal.

## Set synchronization mode

To set the synchronization mode:

1. From **Failover Groups**, select **Edit configuration**. 

   Azure portal shows an **Edit Configuration** control.

   :::image type="content" source="media/managed-instance-disaster-recovery-portal/edit-synchronization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit Configuration control.":::

1. Under **Edit configuration**, select your desired mode, and select **Apply**.

## Delete failover group

1. From Failover Groups**, select **Delete Failover Group**.

   Azure portal asks you to confirm your choice to delete the failover group.

1. Select **Delete failover group** to proceed. Otherwise select **Cancel**, to not delete the group.
