# Available extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

[Cluster extensions for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](conceptual-extensions.md) provide an Azure Resource Manager-driven experience for installation and lifecycle management of different Azure capabilities on top of your cluster. These extensions can be [deployed to your clusters](extensions.md) to enable different scenarios and improve cluster management.

The following extensions are currently available for use with Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. All of these extensions are [cluster-scoped](conceptual-extensions.md#extension-scope), except for Azure API Management on Azure Arc, which is namespace-scoped.

> [!NOTE]
> Installing Azure Arc extensions on [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) hybrid clusters provisioned from Azure](extensions.md#aks-hybrid-clusters-provisioned-from-azure-preview) is currently in preview, with support for the Azure Arc-enabled Open Service Mesh, Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider, Flux (GitOps) and Microsoft Defender for Cloud extensions.

## Azure Monitor Container Insights

- **Supported distributions**: All Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters

Azure Monitor Container Insights provides visibility into the performance of workloads deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. Use this extension to collect memory and CPU utilization metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers.

For more information, see [Azure Monitor Container Insights for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters](../../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-arc-enabled-clusters.md?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

## Azure Policy

Azure Policy extends [Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper), an admission controller webhook for [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA), to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner.

For more information, see [Understand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters](../../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md?toc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/toc.json&bc=/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/breadcrumb/toc.json).

The AzureML extension lets you deploy and run Azure Machine Learning on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.

For more information, see [Introduction to Kubernetes compute target in AzureML](../../machine-learning/how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere.md) and [Deploy AzureML extension on AKS or Arc Kubernetes cluster](../../machine-learning/how-to-deploy-kubernetes-extension.md).

## Flux (GitOps)

- **Supported distributions**: All Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters.

[GitOps on AKS and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](conceptual-gitops-flux2.md) uses [Flux v2](https://fluxcd.io/docs/), a popular open-source tool set, to help manage cluster configuration and application deployment. GitOps is enabled in the cluster as a `Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/extensions/microsoft.flux` cluster extension resource.

For more information, see [Tutorial: Deploy applications using GitOps with Flux v2](tutorial-use-gitops-flux2.md).

The currently supported versions of the `microsoft.flux` extension are described below. The most recent version of the Flux v2 extension and the two previous versions (N-2) are supported. We generally recommend that you use the most recent version of the extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Eventually, a major version update (v2.x.x) for the `microsoft.flux` extension will be released. When this happens, clusters won't be auto-upgraded to this version, since [auto-upgrade is only supported for minor version releases](extensions.md#upgrade-extension-instance). If you're still using an older API version when the next major version is released, you'll need to update your manifests to the latest API versions, perform any necessary testing, then upgrade your extension manually. For more information about the new API versions (breaking changes) and how to update your manifests, see the [Flux v2 release notes](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### 1.7.5 (August 2023)

Flux version: [Release v2.0.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.1)

- source-controller: v1.0.1
- kustomize-controller: v1.0.1
- helm-controller: v0.35.0
- notification-controller: v1.0.0
- image-automation-controller: v0.35.0
- image-reflector-controller: v0.29.1

Changes made for this version:

- Upgrades Flux to [v2.0.1](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.1)
- Promotes some APIs to v1. This change should not affect any existing Flux configurations that have already been deployed. Previous API versions will still be supported in all `microsoft.flux` v.1.x.x releases. However, we recommend that you update the API versions in your manifests as soon as possible. For more information about the new API versions (breaking changes) and how to update your manifests, see the [Flux v2 release notes](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
- Adds support for [Helm drift detection](tutorial-use-gitops-flux2.md#helm-drift-detection) and [OOM watch](tutorial-use-gitops-flux2.md#helm-oom-watch).

### 1.7.4 (June 2023)

Flux version: [Release v0.41.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2)

- source-controller: v0.36.1
- kustomize-controller: v0.35.1
- helm-controller: v0.31.2
- notification-controller: v0.33.0
- image-automation-controller: v0.31.0
- image-reflector-controller: v0.26.1

Changes made for this version:

- Adds support for [`wait`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#wait) and [`postBuild`](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomization/#post-build-variable-substitution) properties as optional parameters for kustomization. By default, `wait` will be set to `true` for all Flux configurations, and `postBuild` will be null. ([Example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/kubernetesconfiguration/resource-manager/Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/stable/2023-05-01/examples/CreateFluxConfiguration.json#L55))

- Adds support for optional properties [`waitForReconciliation`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/kubernetesconfiguration/resource-manager/Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/stable/2023-05-01/fluxconfiguration.json#L1299C14-L1299C35) and [`reconciliationWaitDuration`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/kubernetesconfiguration/resource-manager/Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/stable/2023-05-01/fluxconfiguration.json#L1304).

   By default, `waitForReconciliation` is set to false, so when creating a flux configuration, the `provisioningState` returns `Succeeded` once the configuration reaches the cluster and the ARM template or Azure CLI command successfully exits. However, the actual state of the objects being deployed as part of the configuration is tracked by `complianceState`, which can be viewed in the portal or by using Azure CLI. Setting `waitForReconciliation` to true and specifying a `reconciliationWaitDuration` means that the template or CLI deployment will wait for `complianceState` to reach a terminal state (success or failure) before exiting. ([Example](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/kubernetesconfiguration/resource-manager/Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/stable/2023-05-01/examples/CreateFluxConfiguration.json#L72))

### 1.7.3 (April 2023)

Flux version: [Release v0.41.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2)

- source-controller: v0.36.1
- kustomize-controller: v0.35.1
- helm-controller: v0.31.2
- notification-controller: v0.33.0
- image-automation-controller: v0.31.0
- image-reflector-controller: v0.26.1

Changes made for this version:

- Upgrades Flux to [v0.41.2](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2)
- Fixes issue causing resources that were deployed as part of Flux configuration to persist even when the configuration was deleted with prune flag set to `true`
- Kubelet identity support for image-reflector-controller by [installing the microsoft.flux extension in a cluster with kubelet identity enabled](troubleshooting.md#flux-v2---installing-the-microsoftflux-extension-in-a-cluster-with-kubelet-identity-enabled) 

## Dapr extension for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Arc-enabled Kubernetes

[Dapr](https://dapr.io/) is a portable, event-driven runtime that simplifies building resilient, stateless, and stateful applications that run on the cloud and edge and embrace the diversity of languages and developer frameworks. The Dapr extension eliminates the overhead of downloading Dapr tooling and manually installing and managing the runtime on your clusters.
