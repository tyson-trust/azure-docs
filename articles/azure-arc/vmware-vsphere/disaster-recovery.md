# Recover from accidental deletion of resource bridge VM

In this article, you'll learn how to recover the Azure Arc resource bridge (preview) connection into a working state in disaster scenarios such as accidental deletion. In such cases, the connection between on-premises infrastructure and Azure is lost and any operations performed through Arc will fail.

## Recovering the Arc resource bridge in case of VM deletion

To recover from Arc resource bridge VM deletion, you need to deploy a new resource bridge with the same resource ID as the current resource bridge using the following steps.

1. Copy the Azure region and resource IDs of the Arc resource bridge, custom location, and vCenter Azure resources.

2. Find and delete the old Arc resource bridge template from your vCenter.

3. Download the [onboarding script](../vmware-vsphere/quick-start-connect-vcenter-to-arc-using-script.md#download-the-onboarding-script) from the Azure portal and update the following section in the script, using the same information as the original resources in Azure.

    ```powershell
    $location = <Azure region of the resources>
    $applianceSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $applianceResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $applianceName = <resource-bridge-name>
    
    $customLocationSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $customLocationResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $customLocationName = <custom-location-name>
    
    $vCenterSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $vCenterResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $vCenterName = <vcenter-name-in-azure>
    ```

4. [Run the onboarding script](../vmware-vsphere/quick-start-connect-vcenter-to-arc-using-script.md#run-the-script) again with the `--force` parameter.

    ``` powershell-interactive
    ./resource-bridge-onboarding-script.ps1 --force
    ```

5. [Provide the inputs](../vmware-vsphere/quick-start-connect-vcenter-to-arc-using-script.md#inputs-for-the-script) as prompted.

6. Once the script successfully finishes, the resource bridge should be recovered, and the previously disconnected Arc-enabled resources will be manageable in Azure again.
