# Cost recommendations

Azure Advisor helps you optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources. You can get cost recommendations from the **Cost** tab on the Advisor dashboard.

1. Sign in to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select [**Advisor**](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard) from any page.

1. On the **Advisor** dashboard, select the **Cost** tab.

## Compute

### Use Standard Storage to store Managed Disks snapshots

To save 60% of cost, we recommend storing your snapshots in Standard Storage, regardless of the storage type of the parent disk. It is the default option for Managed Disks snapshots. Migrate your snapshot from Premium to Standard Storage. Refer to Managed Disks pricing details.

Learn more about [Managed Disk Snapshot - ManagedDiskSnapshot (Use Standard Storage to store Managed Disks snapshots)](https://aka.ms/aa_manageddisksnapshot_learnmore).

### Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines

We've analyzed the usage patterns of your virtual machine over the past seven days and identified virtual machines with low usage. While certain scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by managing the size and number of virtual machines.

Learn more about [Virtual machine - LowUsageVmV2 (Right-size or shutdown underutilized virtual machines)](https://aka.ms/aa_lowusagerec_learnmore).

### You have disks which have not been attached to a VM for more than 30 days. Please evaluate if you still need the disk.

We've observed that you have disks which haven't been attached to a VM for more than 30 days. Please evaluate if you still need the disk. If you decide to delete the disk, recovery isn't possible. We recommend that you create a snapshot before deletion or ensure the data in the disk is no longer required.

Learn more about [Disk - DeleteOrDowngradeUnattachedDisks (You have disks which haven't been attached to a VM for more than 30 days. Please evaluate if you still need the disk.)](https://aka.ms/unattacheddisks).

## MariaDB

### Right-size underutilized MariaDB servers

Our internal telemetry shows that the MariaDB database server resources have been underutilized for an extended period of time over the last 7 days. Low resource utilization results in unwanted expenditure which can be fixed without significant performance impact. To reduce your costs and efficiently manage your resources, we recommend reducing the compute size (vCores) by half.

Learn more about [MariaDB server - OrcasMariaDbCpuRightSize (Right-size underutilized MariaDB servers)](https://aka.ms/mariadbpricing).

To reduce your costs and efficiently manage your resources, we recommend reducing the compute size (vCores) by half.

Learn more about [PostgreSQL server - OrcasPostgreSqlCpuRightSize (Right-size underutilized PostgreSQL servers)](https://aka.ms/postgresqlpricing).

## Azure Cosmos DB

### Review the configuration of your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account

Your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account is currently containing resources with a total provisioned throughput exceeding 1000 Request Units per second (RU/s). Because the free tier only covers the first 1000 RU/s of throughput provisioned across your account, any throughput beyond 1000 RU/s will be billed at the regular pricing. As a result, we anticipate that you will get charged for the throughput currently provisioned on your Azure Cosmos DB account.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBFreeTierOverage (Review the configuration of your Azure Cosmos DB free tier account)](../cosmos-db/understand-your-bill.md#azure-free-tier).

### Consider taking action on your idle Azure Cosmos DB containers

We haven't detected any activity over the past 30 days on one or more of your Azure Cosmos DB containers. Consider lowering their throughput, or deleting them if you don't plan on using them.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBIdleContainers (Consider taking action on your idle Azure Cosmos DB containers)](/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-provision-container-throughput).

### Enable autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container

Based on your usage in the past 7 days, you can save by enabling autoscale. For each hour, we compared the RU/s provisioned to the actual utilization of the RU/s (what autoscale would have scaled to) and calculated the cost savings across the time period. Autoscale helps optimize your cost by scaling down RU/s when not in use.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBAutoscaleRecommendations (Enable autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container)](../cosmos-db/provision-throughput-autoscale.md).

### Configure manual throughput instead of autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container

Based on your usage in the past 7 days, you can save by using manual throughput instead of autoscale. Manual throughput is more cost-effective when average utilization of your max throughput (RU/s) is greater than 66% or less than or equal to 10%.

Learn more about [Azure Cosmos DB account - CosmosDBMigrateToManualThroughputFromAutoscale (Configure manual throughput instead of autoscale on your Azure Cosmos DB database or container)](../cosmos-db/how-to-choose-offer.md).

## Data Explorer

### Unused/Empty Data Explorer resources

This recommendation surfaces all Data Explorer resources provisioned more than 10 days from the last update, and found either empty or with no activity. The recommended action is to validate and consider deleting the resources.

Learn more about [Data explorer resource - ADX Unused resource (Unused/Empty Data Explorer resources)](https://aka.ms/adxemptycluster).

### Right-size Data Explorer resources for optimal cost

One or more of these were detected: Low data capacity, CPU utilization, or memory utilization. The recommended action to improve the performance is to scale down and/or scale in the resource to the recommended configuration shown.

Learn more about [Data explorer resource - Right-size for cost (Right-size Data Explorer resources for optimal cost)](https://aka.ms/adxskusize).

### Reduce Data Explorer table cache policy to optimize costs

Reducing the table cache policy will free up Data Explorer cluster nodes with low CPU utilization, memory, and a high cache size configuration.

Learn more about [Data explorer resource - ReduceCacheForAzureDataExplorerTables (Reduce Data Explorer table cache policy to optimize costs)](https://aka.ms/adxcachepolicy).

### Unused running Data Explorer resources

This recommendation surfaces all running Data Explorer resources with no user activity. Consider stopping the resources.

Learn more about [Data explorer resource - StopUnusedClusters (Unused running Data Explorer resources)](/azure/data-explorer/azure-advisor#azure-data-explorer-unused-cluster).

### Cleanup unused storage in Data Explorer resources

Over time, internal extents merge operations can accumulate redundant and unused storage artifacts that remain beyond the data retention period. While this unreferenced data doesn’t negatively impact the performance, it can lead to more storage use and larger costs than necessary. This recommendation surfaces Data Explorer resources that have unused storage artifacts. The recommended action is to run the cleanup command to detect and delete unused storage artifacts and reduce cost. Note that data recoverability will be reset to the cleanup time and will not be available on data that was created before running the cleanup.

Learn more about [Data explorer resource - RunCleanupCommandForAzureDataExplorer (Cleanup unused storage in Data Explorer resources)](https://aka.ms/adxcleanextentcontainers).

### Enable optimized autoscale for Data Explorer resources

Looks like your resource could have automatically scaled to reduce costs (based on the usage patterns, cache utilization, ingestion utilization, and CPU). To optimize costs and performance, we recommend enabling optimized autoscale. To make sure you don't exceed your planned budget, add a maximum instance count when you enable this.

Learn more about [Data explorer resource - EnableOptimizedAutoscaleAzureDataExplorer (Enable optimized autoscale for Data Explorer resources)](https://aka.ms/adxoptimizedautoscale).

## Network

### Delete ExpressRoute circuits in the provider status of Not Provisioned

Learn more about [Virtual network gateway - IdleVNetGateway (Repurpose or delete idle virtual network gateways)](https://aka.ms/aa_idlevpngateway_learnmore).

## Recovery Services

### Use differential or incremental backup for database workloads

For SQL/HANA DBs in Azure VMs being backed up to Azure, using daily differential with weekly full backup is often more cost-effective than daily fully backups. For HANA, Azure Backup also supports incremental backup which is even more cost effective

Learn more about [Recovery Services vault - Optimize costs of database backup (Use differential or incremental backup for database workloads)](https://aka.ms/DBBackupCostOptimization).

## Storage

### Revisit retention policy for classic log data in storage accounts

Large classic log data is detected on your storage accounts. You are billed on capacity of data stored in storage accounts including classic logs. You are recommended to check the retention policy of classic logs and update with necessary period to retain less log data. This would reduce unnecessary classic log data and save your billing cost from less capacity.

### Right-size underutilized App Service plans

We've analyzed the usage patterns of your app service plan over the past 7 days and identified low CPU usage. While certain scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by choosing a less expensive SKU while retaining the same features.

> [!NOTE]
> - Currently, this recommendation only works for App Service plans running on Windows on a SKU that allows you to downscale to less expensive tiers without losing any features, like from P3v2 to P2v2 or from P2v2 to P1v2. 
> - CPU bursts that last only a few minutes might not be correctly detected. Please perform a careful analysis in your App Service plan metrics blade before downscaling your SKU.

Learn more about [App Service plans](../app-service/overview-hosting-plans.md).

### Unused/Empty App Service plans

Your App Service plan has no apps running for at least 3 days. Consider deleting the resource to save costs.
