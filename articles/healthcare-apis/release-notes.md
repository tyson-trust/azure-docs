# Release notes: Azure Health Data Services

> Azure Health Data Services is Generally Available. 
>
>For more information about Azure Health Data Services Service Level Agreements, see [SLA for Azure Health Data Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/health-data-services/v1_1/).

Azure Health Data Services is a set of managed API services based on open standards and frameworks for the healthcare industry. They enable you to build scalable and secure healthcare solutions by bringing protected health information (PHI) datasets together and connecting them end-to-end with tools for machine learning, analytics, and AI. This document provides details about the features and enhancements made to Azure Health Data Services including the different service types (FHIR service, DICOM service, and MedTech service) that seamlessly work with one another.

## July 2023
#### Azure Health Data Services

#### FHIR Service
**Continous retry on Import operation**

We observed an issue where $import kept on retrying when NDJSON file size is greater than 2GB. The issue is fixed, for details visit [3342](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3342).

**Patient and Group level export job restart**

Patient and Group level exports on interruption would restart from the beginning. Bug is fixed to restart the export jobs from the last sucessfully completed page of results. For more details visit [3205](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3205).

#### DICOM Service
**API Version 2 is Generally Available (GA)**

The DICOM service API v2 is now Generally Available (GA) and introduces [several changes and new features](dicom/dicom-service-v2-api-changes.md).  Most notable is the change to validation of DICOM attributes during store (STOW) operations - beginning with v2, the request fails only if **required attributes** fail validation.  See the [DICOM Conformance Statement v2](dicom/dicom-services-conformance-statement-v2.md) for full details.  


## June 2023
#### Azure Health Data Services

#### FHIR Service 

**Introducing Incremental Import**

$Import operation now supports new capability of "Incremental Load" mode, which is optimized for periodically loading data into the FHIR service. 

With Incremental Load mode, customers can:
1.	Perform concurrent ingestion of data while simultaneously executing API CRUD operations on the FHIR server.
1.	Ingest versioned FHIR resources.
1.	Maintain the lastUpdated field value in FHIR resources during ingestion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Incremental import mode is currently in public preview
> Preview APIs and SDKs are provided without a service-level agreement. We recommend that you don't use them for production workloads. Some features might not be supported, or they might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, review [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

For details on Incremental Import, visit [Import Documentation](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/configure-import-data.md).

**Reindex operation provides job status at resource level**

Reindex operation supports determining the status of the reindex operation with help of API call `GET {{FHIR_URL}}/_operations/reindex/{{reindexJobId}}`.
Details per resource, on the number of completed reindexed resources can be obtained with help of the new field, added in the response- "resourceReindexProgressByResource". For details, visit [3286](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3286).

**FHIR Search Query optimization of complex queries**

We have seen issues where complex FHIR queries with Reference Search Parameters would time out. Issue is fixed by updating the SQL query generator to use an INNER JOIN for Reference Search Parameters. For details, visit [#3295](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3295).

**Metadata endpoint URL in capability statement is relative URL**

Per FHIR specification, metadata endpoint URL in capability statement needs to be an absolute URL. For details on the FHIR specification, visit [Capability Statement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement-definitions.html#CapabilityStatement.url). This fix addresses the issue, for details visit [3265](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3265).


#### DICOM Service

**Retrieve rendered image is GA**

[Rendered images](dicom/dicom-services-conformance-statement.md#retrieve-rendered-image-for-instance-or-frame) can now be retrieved from the DICOM service by using the new rendered endpoint.  This API allows a DICOM instance or frame to be accessed in a consumer format (`jpeg` or `png`), a capability that can simplify scenarios such as a client application displaying an image preview.  


**Fixed issue where DICOM events and Change Feed may miss changes**

The DICOM Change Feed API could previously return results that incorrectly skipped pending changes when the DICOM server was under load. Identical calls to the Change Feed resource could have resulted in new change events appearing in the middle of the result set. For example, if the first call returned sequence numbers `1`, `2`, `3`, and `5`, then the second identical call could have incorrectly returned `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`. This behavior also impacted the DICOM events sent to Azure Event Grid System Topics, and could have resulted in missing events in downstream event handlers. For more details, see [#2611](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/2611).

#### MedTech service 

**Encounter identifiers included in the device message**

Customers can now include encounter identifiers in the device message so that they can look up the corresponding FHIR encounter and link it to the observation created in the FHIR transformation. This look up feature is supported in OSS and was an ask from customers for the PaaS MedTech service.


## May 2023
#### Azure Health Data Services

#### FHIR Service 

**SMART on FHIR : Fixed clinical scope mapping for applications**

This bug fix addresses issue with clinical scope not interpreted correctly for backend applications. 
For more details, visit [#3250](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3250)

**Addresses duplicate key error when passed in request parameters and body**

This bug fix handles the issue, when using the POST {resourcetype}/search endpoint to query FHIR resources, the server returns 415 Unsupported Media Type. This issue is due to repeating a query parameter in the URL query string and the request body. This fix considers all the query parameters from request and body as input. For more details, visit [#3232](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/3232)

## April 2023

**Added handling for SqlTruncate errors**

Added a check for SqlTruncate exceptions and tests. In particular, exceptions and tests will catch SqlTruncate exceptions for Decimal type based on the specified precision and scale. For more information, see [#2553](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2553). 

#### DICOM service

**DICOM service supports cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)**

DICOM service now supports [CORS](./../healthcare-apis/dicom/configure-cross-origin-resource-sharing.md). CORS allows you to configure settings so that applications from one domain (origin) can access resources from a different domain, known as a cross-domain request. 

**DICOMcast supports Private Link**

DICOMcast has been updated to support Azure Health Data Services workspaces that have been configured to use [Private Link](./../healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-configure-private-link.md). 

**UPS-RS supports Change and Retrieve work item**  

Modality worklist (UPS-RS) endpoints have been added to support Change and Retrieve operations for work items. 

**API version is now required as part of the URI**

All REST API requests to the DICOM service must now include the API version in the URI. For more information, see [API versioning for DICOM service](./../healthcare-apis/dicom/api-versioning-dicom-service.md). 

**Index the first value for DICOM tags that incorrectly specify multiple values**

Attributes that are defined to have a single value but have specified multiple values will now be leniently accepted. The first value for such attributes will be indexed.

## April 2022

#### FHIR service


** Added FHIRPath Patch**
FHIRPath Patch was added as a feature to both the Azure API for FHIR. This implements FHIRPath Patch as defined on the [HL7](http://hl7.org/fhir/fhirpatch.html) website. 


**Handles invalid header on versioned update**

 When the versioning policy is set to "versioned-update", we required that the most recent version of the resource is provided in the request's if-match header on an update. The specified version must be in ETag format. Previously, a 500 would be returned if the version was invalid or in an incorrect format. This update now returns a 400 Bad Request. For more information, see [PR #2467](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2467). 


**Bulk import in public preview**
The bulk-import feature enables importing FHIR data to the FHIR server at high throughput using the $import operation. It's designed for initial data load into the FHIR server. For more information, see [Bulk-import FHIR data (Preview)](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/import-data.md). 


**Added back the core to resource path**

 Part of the path to a string resource was accidentally removed in the versioning policy. This fix adds it back in. For more information, see [PR #2470](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2470). 



#### DICOM service


**Reduced the strictness of validation applied to incoming DICOM files** 

When value representation (VR) is a decimal string (DS)/ integer string (IS), `fo-dicom` serialization treats value as a number. Customer DICOM files could be old and contains invalid numbers. Our service blocks such file upload due to the serialization exception. For more information, see [PR #1450](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1450). 

**Correctly parse a range of input in the content negotiation headers**

Currently, WADO with Accept: multipart/related; type=application/dicom will throw an error. It will accept Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom", but they should be equivalent. For more information, see [PR #1462](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1462). 


**Fixed an issue where parallel upload of images in a study could fail under certain circumstances**

Handle race conditions during parallel instance inserts in the same study. For more information, see [PR #1491](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1491) and [PR #1496](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/pull/1496). 

## March 2022

### FHIR service

**FHIRPath Patch operation available**
|This new feature enables you to use the FHIRPath Patch operation on FHIR resources. For more information, see [FHIR REST API capabilities for Azure Health Data Services FHIR service](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/fhir-rest-api-capabilities.md). 


**SQL timeout that returns 408 status code**
Previously, a SQL timeout would return a 500. Now a timeout in SQL will return a FHIR OperationOutcome with a 408 status code. For more information, see [PR #2497](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2497). 

**Fixed issue related to duplicate resources in search with `_include`**
Fixed issue where a single resource can be returned twice in a search that has `_include`. For more information, see [PR #2448](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2448). 


**Fixed issue PUT creates on versioned update**
Fixed issue where creates with PUT resulted in an error when the versioning policy is configured to `versioned-update`. For more information, see [PR #2457](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2457). 

**Invalid header handling on versioned update**

 Fixed issue where invalid `if-match` header would result in an HTTP 500 error. Now an HTTP Bad Request is returned instead. For more information, see [PR #2467](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2467). 

#### MedTech service

**The Events feature within Health Data Services is now generally available (GA).**

You can now find the publisher in the capability statement at `CapabilityStatement.name`. [#2319](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2319) 


**Log `FhirOperation` linked to anonymous calls to Request metrics**

 We weren't logging operations that didn’t require authentication. We extended the ability to get `FhirOperation` type in `RequestMetrics` for anonymous calls. [#2295](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2295) 

**Fixed 500 error when `SearchParameter` Code is null**

Fixed an issue with `SearchParameter` if it had a null value for Code, the result would be a 500. Now it will result in an  `InvalidResourceException` like the other values do. [#2343](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2343)
 
**Returned `BadRequestException` with valid message when input JSON body is invalid**

For invalid JSON body requests, the FHIR server was returning a 500 error. Now we'll return a `BadRequestException` with a valid message instead of 500. [#2239](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2239) 


**Handled SQL Timeout issue**

If SQL Server timed out, the PUT `/resource{id}` returned a 500 error. Now we handle the 500 error and return a timeout exception with an operation outcome. [#2290](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2290) 

## November 2021

#### FHIR service

#### **Feature enhancements**

**Process Patient-everything links**

We've expanded the Patient-everything capabilities to process patient links [#2305](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2305). For more information, see [Patient-everything in FHIR](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/patient-everything.md#processing-patient-links) documentation. 

**Added software name and version to capability statement.**
In the capability statement, the software name now distinguishes if you're using Azure API for FHIR or Azure Health Data Services. The software version will now specify which open-source [release package](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/releases) is live in the managed service [#2294](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2294). Addresses: [#1778](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/1778) and [#2241](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/2241) 


**Compress continuation tokens**

In certain instances, the continuation token was too long to be able to follow the [next link](./../healthcare-apis/fhir/overview-of-search.md#pagination) in searches and would result in a 404. To resolve this, we compressed the continuation token to ensure it stays below the size limit [#2279](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2279). Addresses issue [#2250](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/2250). 

**FHIR service autoscale**

The [FHIR service autoscale](./fhir/fhir-service-autoscale.md) is designed to provide optimized service scalability automatically to meet customer demands when they perform data transactions in consistent or various workloads at any time. It's available in all [regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/) where the FHIR service is supported. 


**Resolved 500 error when the date was passed with a time zone.**

This fix addresses a 500 error when a date with a time zone was passed into a datetime field [#2270](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2270). 


**Resolved issue when posting a bundle with incorrect Media Type returned a 500 error.**

Previously when posting a search with a key that contains certain characters, a 500 error is returned. This fixes issue [#2264](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/pull/2264) and addresses [#2148](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/issues/2148). 

#### DICOM service

**Content-Type header now includes transfer-syntax.**

This enhancement enables the user to know which transfer syntax is used in case multiple accept headers are being supplied. 

## October 2021

#### Azure Health Data Services 

**Test Data Generator tool**

We've updated Azure Health Data Services GitHub samples repo to include a [Test Data Generator tool](https://github.com/microsoft/healthcare-apis-samples/blob/main/docs/HowToRunPerformanceTest.md) using Synthea data. This tool is an improvement to the open source [public test projects](https://github.com/ShadowPic/PublicTestProjects), based on Apache JMeter that can be deployed to Azure AKS for performance tests.
