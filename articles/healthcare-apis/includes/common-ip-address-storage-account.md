### Allowing specific IP addresses from other Azure regions to access the Azure storage account

In the Azure portal, go to the ADLS Gen2 account and select the **Networking** blade. 
   
Select **Enabled from selected virtual networks and IP addresses**. Under the Firewall section, specify the IP address in the **Address range** box. Add IP ranges to allow access from the internet or your on-premises networks. You can find the IP address in the table below for the Azure region where the FHIR service is provisioned.

|**Azure Region**         |**Public IP Address** |

### Allowing specific IP addresses to access the Azure storage account in the same region

The configuration process for IP addresses in the same region is just like above except a specific IP address range in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format is used instead (i.e., 100.64.0.0/10). The reason why the IP address range (100.64.0.0 â€“ 100.127.255.255) must be specified is because an IP address for the FHIR service will be allocated each time an operation request is made.

> [!NOTE] 
> It is possible that a private IP address within the range of 10.0.2.0/24 may be used, but there is no guarantee that the operation will succeed in such a case. You can retry if the operation request fails, but until an IP address within the range of 100.64.0.0/10 is used, the request will not succeed. This network behavior for IP address ranges is by design. The alternative is to configure the storage account in a different region.
