# Using DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs with Python

This tutorial uses Python to demonstrate working with the DICOM Service.

In the tutorial, we'll use the following [sample .dcm DICOM files](https://github.com/microsoft/dicom-server/tree/main/docs/dcms).

* blue-circle.dcm
* dicom-metadata.csv
* green-square.dcm
* red-triangle.dcm

 The file name, studyUID, seriesUID, and instanceUID of the sample DICOM files is as follows:

| File | StudyUID | SeriesUID | InstanceUID |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|green-square.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.12714725698140337137334606354172323212|
|red-triangle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395|
|blue-circle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.77033797676425927098669402985243398207|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13273713909719068980354078852867170114|

> [!NOTE]
> Each of these files represent a single instance and are part of the same study. Also,the green-square and red-triangle are part of the same series, while the blue-circle is in a separate series.

## Prerequisites

To use the DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs, you must have an instance of the DICOM service deployed. If you haven't already deployed the DICOM service, see [Deploy DICOM service using the Azure portal](deploy-dicom-services-in-azure.md).

After you've deployed an instance of the DICOM service, retrieve the URL for your App service:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search **Recent resources** and select your DICOM service instance.
1. Copy the **Service URL** of your DICOM service. 
2. If you haven't already obtained a token, see [Get access token for the DICOM service using Azure CLI](dicom-get-access-token-azure-cli.md). 

For this code, we'll be accessing a Public Preview Azure service. It's important that you don't upload any private health information (PHI).

## Working with the DICOM service

The DICOMweb&trade; Standard makes heavy use of `multipart/related` HTTP requests combined with DICOM specific accept headers. Developers familiar with other REST-based APIs often find working with the DICOMweb&trade; standard awkward. However, once you've it up and running, it's easy to use. It just takes a little familiarity to get started.

### Import the appropriate Python libraries

First, import the necessary Python libraries.

We've chosen to implement this example using the synchronous `requests` library. For asynchronous support, consider using `httpx` or another async library. Additionally, we're importing two supporting functions from `urllib3` to support working with `multipart/related` requests.

Additionally, we're importing `DefaultAzureCredential` to log into Azure and get a token.

```python
import requests
import pydicom
from pathlib import Path
from urllib3.filepost import encode_multipart_formdata, choose_boundary
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
```

### Configure user-defined variables to be used throughout

Replace all variable values wrapped in { } with your own values. Additionally, validate that any constructed variables are correct.  For instance, `base_url` is constructed using the Service URL and then appended with the version of the REST API being used. The Service URL of your DICOM service will be: ```https://<workspacename-dicomservicename>.dicom.azurehealthcareapis.com```. You can use the Azure portal to navigate to the DICOM service and obtain your Service URL. You can also visit the [API Versioning for DICOM service Documentation](api-versioning-dicom-service.md) for more information on versioning. If you're using a custom URL, you'll need to override that value with your own.

```python
dicom_service_name = "{server-name}"
path_to_dicoms_dir = "{path to the folder that includes green-square.dcm and other dcm files}"

base_url = f"{Service URL}/v{version}"

study_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420"; #StudyInstanceUID for all 3 examples
series_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652"; #SeriesInstanceUID for green-square and red-triangle
instance_uid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395"; #SOPInstanceUID for red-triangle
```

### Authenticate to Azure and get a token

`DefaultAzureCredential` allows us to get a variety of ways to get tokens to log into the service. We'll use the `AzureCliCredential` to get a token to log into the service. There are other credential providers such as `ManagedIdentityCredential` and `EnvironmentCredential` that are also possible to use. In order to use the AzureCliCredential, you must have logged into Azure from the CLI prior to running this code. (For more information, see [Get access token for the DICOM service using Azure CLI](dicom-get-access-token-azure-cli.md).) Alternatively, you can simply copy and paste the token retrieved while logging in from the CLI.

> [!NOTE]
> `DefaultAzureCredential` returns several different Credential objects. We reference the `AzureCliCredential` as the 5th item in the returned collection. This may not be consistent. If so, uncomment the `print(credential.credential)` line. This will list all the items. Find the correct index, recalling that Python uses zero-based indexing.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not logged into Azure using the CLI, this will fail. You must be logged into Azure from the CLI for this to work. 

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

#print(credential.credentials) # this can be used to find the index of the AzureCliCredential
token = credential.credentials[4].get_token('https://dicom.healthcareapis.azure.com')
bearer_token = f'Bearer {token.token}'
```

### Create supporting methods to support `multipart\related`

The `Requests` libraries (and most Python libraries) don't work with `multipart\related` in a way that supports DICOMweb&trade;. Because of these libraries, we must add a few methods to support working with DICOM files.

`encode_multipart_related` takes a set of fields (in the DICOM case, these libraries are generally Part 10 dam files) and an optional user-defined boundary. It returns both the full body, along with the content_type, which it can be used.

```python
def encode_multipart_related(fields, boundary=None):
    if boundary is None:
        boundary = choose_boundary()

    body, _ = encode_multipart_formdata(fields, boundary)
    content_type = str('multipart/related; boundary=%s' % boundary)

    return body, content_type
```

### Create a `requests` session

Creates a `requests` session, called `client`, that will be used to communicate with the DICOM service.


```python
client = requests.session()
```

### Verify authentication is configured correctly

Call the changefeed API endpoint, which will return a 200 if authentication is successful.

```python
headers = {"Authorization":bearer_token}
url= f'{base_url}/changefeed'

response = client.get(url,headers=headers)
if (response.status_code != 200):
    print('Error! Likely not authenticated!')
```

## Uploading DICOM Instances (STOW)

The following examples highlight persisting DICOM files.

### Store instances using `multipart/related`

This example demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file, and it uses a bit of a Python to pre-load the DICOM file (as bytes) into memory. By passing an array of files to the fields parameter of `encode_multipart_related`, multiple files can be uploaded in a single POST. It's sometimes used to upload several instances inside a complete series or study.

_Details:_

* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * Accept: application/dicom+json
    * Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"
    * Authorization: Bearer $token"

* Body:
    * Content-Type: application/dicom for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value

Some programming languages and tools behave differently. For instance, some of them require you to define your own boundary. For those, you may need to use a slightly modified Content-Type header. The following have been used successfully.
* Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; boundary=ABCD1234
* Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=ABCD1234
* Content-Type: multipart/related

```python
#upload blue-circle.dcm
filepath = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('blue-circle.dcm')

# Read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile = reader.read()
files = {'file': ('dicomfile', rawfile, 'application/dicom')}

#encode as multipart_related
body, content_type = encode_multipart_related(fields = files)

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', "Content-Type":content_type, "Authorization":bearer_token}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
```

### Store instances for a specific study

This example demonstrates how to upload multiple DICOM files into the specified study. It uses a bit of a Python to pre-load the DICOM file (as bytes) into memory.  

By passing an array of files to the fields parameter of `encode_multipart_related`, multiple files can be uploaded in a single POST. It's sometimes used to upload a complete series or study. 

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * Accept: application/dicom+json
    * Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"
    * Authorization: Bearer $token"
* Body:
    * Content-Type: application/dicom for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value


```python

filepath_red = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('red-triangle.dcm')
filepath_green = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('green-square.dcm')

# Open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath_red,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile_red = reader.read()
with open(filepath_green,'rb') as reader:
    rawfile_green = reader.read()  
       
files = {'file_red': ('dicomfile', rawfile_red, 'application/dicom'),
         'file_green': ('dicomfile', rawfile_green, 'application/dicom')}

#encode as multipart_related
body, content_type = encode_multipart_related(fields = files)

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', "Content-Type":content_type, "Authorization":bearer_token}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
```
### Store single instance (non-standard)

The following code example demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file. It's a non-standard API endpoint that simplifies uploading a single file as binary bytes sent in the body of a request

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
   *  Accept: application/dicom+json
   *  Content-Type: application/dicom
   *  Authorization: Bearer $token"
* Body:
    * Contains a single DICOM file as binary bytes.

```python
#upload blue-circle.dcm
filepath = Path(path_to_dicoms_dir).joinpath('blue-circle.dcm')

# Open up and read through file and load bytes into memory 
with open(filepath,'rb') as reader:
    body = reader.read()

headers = {'Accept':'application/dicom+json', 'Content-Type':'application/dicom', "Authorization":bearer_token}

url = f'{base_url}/studies'
response = client.post(url, body, headers=headers, verify=False)
response  # response should be a 409 Conflict if the file was already uploaded in the above request
```

## Retrieve DICOM Instances (WADO)

The following examples highlight retrieving DICOM instances.

### Retrieve all instances within a study

This example retrieves all instances within a single study.

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: GET
* Headers:
   * Accept: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*
   * Authorization: Bearer $token"

All three of the dcm files that we uploaded previously are part of the same study so the response should return all three instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all three instances are returned.

```python
url = f'{base_url}/studies/{study_uid}'
headers = {'Accept':'multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*', "Authorization":bearer_token}

response = client.get(url, headers=headers) #, verify=False)
```

### Use the retrieved instances

The instances are retrieved as binary bytes. You can loop through the returned items and convert the bytes into a file-like that can be read by `pydicom`.


```python
import requests_toolbelt as tb
from io import BytesIO

mpd = tb.MultipartDecoder.from_response(response)
for part in mpd.parts:
    # Note that the headers are returned as binary!
    print(part.headers[b'content-type'])
    
    # You can convert the binary body (of each part) into a pydicom DataSet
    #   And get direct access to the various underlying fields
    dcm = pydicom.dcmread(BytesIO(part.content))
    print(dcm.PatientName)
    print(dcm.SOPInstanceUID)
```
