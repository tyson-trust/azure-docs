# How to disable the events feature and delete Azure Health Data Services workspaces

> [!NOTE]
> [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is an open healthcare specification.

In this article, learn how to disable the events feature and delete Azure Health Data Services workspaces.

## Disable events

To disable events from sending event messages for a single **Event Subscription**, the **Event Subscription** must be deleted.

1. Select the **Event Subscription** to be deleted. In this example, we select an Event Subscription named **fhir-events**.

2. Select **Delete** and confirm the Event Subscription deletion.

3. To completely disable events, delete all **Event Subscriptions** so that no **Event Subscriptions** remain.

> [!NOTE]
> The FHIR service will automatically go into an **Updating** status to disable the Events extension when a full delete of Event Subscriptions is executed. The FHIR service will remain online while the operation is completing.

## Delete workspaces

To avoid errors and successfully delete workspaces, follow these steps and in this specific order:

1. Delete all workspace associated child resources - for example: DICOM services, FHIR services, and MedTech services.
2. Delete all workspace associated Event Subscriptions.
3. Delete workspace.
