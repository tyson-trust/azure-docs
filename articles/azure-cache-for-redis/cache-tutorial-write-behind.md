# Tutorial: Create a write-behind cache by using Azure Functions and Azure Cache for Redis

The objective of this tutorial is to use an Azure Cache for Redis instance as a [write-behind cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-caching/#types-of-caching). The write-behind pattern in this tutorial shows how writes to the cache trigger corresponding writes to a SQL database (an instance of the Azure SQL Database service).

You use the [Redis trigger for Azure Functions](cache-how-to-functions.md) to implement this functionality. In this scenario, you see how to use Azure Cache for Redis to store inventory and pricing information, while backing up that information in a SQL database.

Every new item or new price written to the cache is then reflected in a SQL table in the database.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * Configure a database, trigger, and connection strings.
> * Validate that triggers are working.
> * Deploy code to a function app.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Completion of the previous tutorial, [Get started with Azure Functions triggers in Azure Cache for Redis](cache-tutorial-functions-getting-started.md), with these resources provisioned:
  - Azure Cache for Redis instance
  - Azure Functions instance
  - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment set up with NuGet packages installed

## Create and configure a new SQL database

The SQL database is the backing database for this example. You can create a SQL database through the Azure portal or through your preferred method of automation.

This example uses the portal:

1. Enter a database name and select **Create new** to create a new server to hold the database.

1. Select **Use SQL authentication** and enter an admin sign-in and password. Be sure to remember these credentials or write them down. When you're deploying a server in production, use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication instead.

1. Go to the **Networking** tab and choose **Public endpoint** as a connection method. Select **Yes** for both firewall rules that appear. This endpoint allows access from your Azure function app.

1. After validation finishes, select **Review + create** and then **Create**. The SQL database starts to deploy.

1. After deployment finishes, go to the resource in the Azure portal and select the **Query editor** tab. Create a new table called *inventory* that holds the data you'll write to it. Use the following SQL command to make a new table with two fields:

   - `ItemName` lists the name of each item.
   - `Price` stores the price of the item.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE inventory (
       ItemName varchar(255),
       Price decimal(18,2)
       );
   ```

1. After the command finishes running, expand the *Tables* folder and verify that the new table was created.

## Configure the Redis trigger

First, make a copy of the same VS Code project that you used in the previous tutorial. Copy the folder from the previous tutorial under a new name, such as *RedisWriteBehindTrigger*, and open it in VS Code.

In this example, you use the [pub/sub trigger](cache-how-to-functions.md#redispubsubtrigger) to trigger on `keyevent` notifications. The goals of the example are:

- Trigger every time a `SET` event occurs. A `SET` event happens when either new keys are written to the cache instance or the value of a key is changed.
- After a `SET` event is triggered, access the cache instance to find the value of the new key.
- Determine if the key already exists in the *inventory* table in the SQL database.
  - If so, update the value of that key.
  - If not, write a new row with the key and its value.

To configure the trigger:

1. Import the `System.Data.SqlClient` NuGet package to enable communication with the SQL database. Go to the VS Code terminal and use the following command:

   ```dos
   dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient
   ```

1. Copy and paste the following code in *redisfunction.cs* to replace the existing code:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
   using StackExchange.Redis;
   using System;
   using System.Data.SqlClient;

   namespace Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Redis
   {
       public static class WriteBehind
       {
           public const string connectionString = "redisConnectionString";
           public const string SQLAddress = "SQLConnectionString";

           [FunctionName("KeyeventTrigger")]
           public static void KeyeventTrigger(
               [RedisPubSubTrigger(connectionString, "__keyevent@0__:set")] string message,
               ILogger logger)
           {
               // Retrieve a Redis connection string from environmental variables.
               var redisConnectionString = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(connectionString);
            
               // Connect to a Redis cache instance.
               var redisConnection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(redisConnectionString);
               var cache = redisConnection.GetDatabase();
            
               // Get the key that was set and its value.
               var key = message;
               var value = (double)cache.StringGet(key);
               logger.LogInformation($"Key {key} was set to {value}");

               // Retrieve a SQL connection string from environmental variables.
               String SQLConnectionString = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(SQLAddress);
            
               // Define the name of the table you created and the column names.
               String tableName = "dbo.inventory";
               String column1Value = "ItemName";
               String column2Value = "Price";
           
              // Connect to the database. Check if the key exists in the database. If it does, update the value. If it doesn't, add it to the database.
               using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(SQLConnectionString))
               {
                   connection.Open();
                   using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand())
                   {
                       command.Connection = connection;

                       //Form the SQL query to update the database. In practice, you would want to use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
                       //An example query would be something like "UPDATE dbo.inventory SET Price = 1.75 WHERE ItemName = 'Apple'".
                       command.CommandText = "UPDATE " + tableName + " SET " + column2Value + " = " + value + " WHERE " + column1Value + " = '" + key + "'";
                       int rowsAffected = command.ExecuteNonQuery(); //The query execution returns the number of rows affected by the query. If the key doesn't exist, it will return 0.

                       if (rowsAffected == 0) //If key doesn't exist, add it to the database
                    {
                            //Form the SQL query to update the database. In practice, you would want to use a parameterized query to prevent SQL injection attacks.
                            //An example query would be something like "INSERT INTO dbo.inventory (ItemName, Price) VALUES ('Bread', '2.55')".
                           command.CommandText = "INSERT INTO " + tableName + " (" + column1Value + ", " + column2Value + ") VALUES ('" + key + "', '" + value + "')";
                           command.ExecuteNonQuery();
                        
                           logger.LogInformation($"Item " + key + " has been added to the database with price " + value + "");
                       }
                    
                       else {
                           logger.LogInformation($"Item " + key + " has been updated to price " + value + "");
                       }
                   }
                   connection.Close();
               }
            
               //Log the time that the function was executed.
               logger.LogInformation($"C# Redis trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
           }
       }
   }
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example is simplified for the tutorial. For production use, we recommend that you use parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

## Configure connection strings

You need to update the *local.settings.json* file to include the connection string for your SQL database. Add an entry in the `Values` section for `SQLConnectionString`. Your file should look like this example:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
    "redisConnectionString": "<redis-connection-string>",
    "SQLConnectionString": "<sql-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

You need to manually enter the password for your SQL database connection string, because the password isn't pasted automatically.

To find the Redis connection string, go to the resource menu in the Azure Cache for Redis resource. The string is in the **Access Keys** area.

To find the SQL database connection string, go to the resource menu in the SQL database resource, and then select the **ADO.NET** tab. The string is in the **Connection strings** area.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This example is simplified for the tutorial. For production use, we recommend that you use [Azure Key Vault](../service-connector/tutorial-portal-key-vault.md) to store connection string information.
>

## Build and run the project

1. In VS Code, go to the **Run and debug tab** and run the project.
1. Go back to your Azure Cache for Redis instance in the Azure portal, and select the **Console** button to enter the Redis console. Try using some `SET` commands:

   - `SET apple 5.25`
   - `SET bread 2.25`
   - `SET apple 4.50`

1. Back in VS Code, the triggers are being registered. To validate that the triggers are working:

   1. Go to the SQL database in the Azure portal.
   1. On the resource menu, select **Query editor**.
   1. For **New Query**, create a query with the following SQL command to view the top 100 items in the inventory table:

      ```sql
      SELECT TOP (100) * FROM [dbo].[inventory]
      ```

      Confirm that the items written to your Azure Cache for Redis instance appear here.

## Deploy the code to your function app

1. In VS Code, go to the **Azure** tab.

1. Find your subscription and expand it. Then, find the **Function App** section and expand that.

1. Select and hold (or right-click) your function app, and then select **Deploy to Function App**.

## Add connection string information

1. Go to your function app in the Azure portal. On the resource menu, select **Configuration**.

1. Select **New application setting**. For **Name**, enter **SQLConnectionString**. For **Value**, enter your connection string.

1. Set **Type** to **Custom**, and then select **Ok** to close the menu.

1. On the **Configuration** pane, select **Save** to confirm. The function app restarts with the new connection string information.

## Verify deployment

After the deployment finishes, go back to your Azure Cache for Redis instance and use `SET` commands to write more values. Confirm that they also appear in your SQL database.

If you want to confirm that your function app is working properly, go to the app in the portal and select **Log stream** from the resource menu. You should see the triggers running there, and the corresponding updates being made to your SQL database.

If you ever want to clear the SQL database table without deleting it, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE [dbo].[inventory]
```

## Summary
