# Quickstart: Register and Authorize Spacecraft

To contact a satellite, it must be registered and authorized as a spacecraft resource with Azure Orbital Ground Station using required identifying information.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Contributor permissions at the subscription level.
- A [Basic Support Plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) or higher is required for a spacecraft authorization request.
- Private spacecraft must have a relevant spacecraft license.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/orbital/portal).

## Create spacecraft resource

1. In the Azure Portal search box, enter **Spacecraft**. Select **Spacecraft** in the search results.
2. In the **Spacecraft** page, select Create.
3. In **Create spacecraft resource**, enter or select this information in the Basics tab:

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | Subscription | Select your subscription |
   | Resource Group | Select your resource group |
   | Name | Enter spacecraft name |
   | Region | Enter region, e.g. West US 2 |
   | NORAD ID | Enter NORAD ID |
   | TLE title line | Enter TLE title line |
   | TLE line 1 | Enter TLE line 1 |
   | TLE line 2 | Enter TLE line 2 |
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > TLE stands for Two-Line Element. 
   > Be sure to update this TLE value before you schedule a contact. A TLE that is more than two weeks old might result in an unsuccessful downlink.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Spacecraft resources can be created in any Azure region with a Microsoft ground station and schedule contacts on any ground station. Current eligible Azure regions are West US 2, Sweden Central, Southeast Asia, Brazil South, and South Africa North.

6. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select the **Review + create** button.
7. Select **Create**

## Request authorization of the new spacecraft resource

   > [!NOTE]
   > Authorization of private spacecraft requires the customer to have acquired a spacecraft license for their spacecraft. Microsoft can provide technical information required to complete the federal regulator and ITU processes as needed. This process augments the ground station licenses in our network and ensures customer satellites are added and authorized. Third party ground station networks are not included.
   > 
   > Public spacecraft do not require licensing for authorization. The Azure Orbital Ground Station service supports several public satellites including Aqua, Suomi NPP, JPSS-1/NOAA-20, and Terra.


1. Navigate to the newly created spacecraft resource's overview page.
2. Select **New support request** in the Support + troubleshooting section of the left-hand blade.
3. In the **New support request** page, enter or select this information in the Basics tab:

| **Field** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| Summary | Request Authorization for [Spacecraft Name] |
| Issue type |	Select **Technical** |
| Subscription |	Select the subscription in which the spacecraft resource was created |
| Service |	Select **My services** |
| Service type |	Search for and select **Azure Orbital** |
| Problem type |	Select **Spacecraft Management and Setup** |
| Problem subtype |	Select **Spacecraft Registration** |

4. Select the Details tab at the top of the page
5. In the Details tab, enter this information in the Problem details section:

| **Field** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| When did the problem start? |	Select the current date & time |
| Description |	List your spacecraft's **frequency bands** and **desired ground stations** |
| File upload |	Upload any **pertinent licensing material**, if applicable |

6. Complete the **Advanced diagnostic information** and **Support method** sections of the **Details** tab.
7. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select the **Review + create** button.
8. Select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > A [Basic Support Plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/) or higher is required for a spacecraft authorization request.

### Private spacecraft

#### Step 1: Provide more detail
After the authorization request is generated, our regulatory team will investigate the request and determine if more detail is required. If so, a customer support representative will reach out to you with a regulatory intake form. You will need to input information regarding relevant filings, call signs, orbital parameters, link details, antenna details, point of contacts, etc.

Fill out all relevant fields in this form. When you are finished entering information, email this form back to the customer support representative.

#### Step 2: Await feedback from our regulatory team
Based on the details provided in the steps above, our regulatory team will make an assessment on time and cost to onboard your spacecraft to all requested ground stations. This step will take a few weeks to execute.

Once the determination is made, we will confirm the cost with you and ask you to authorize before proceeding.

#### Step 3: Azure Orbital Ground Station requests relevant ground station licensing

Upon authorization, you will be billed the fees associated with licensing your spacecraft at each relevant ground station. Our regulatory team will seek the relevant licenses to enable your spacecraft to communicate with the desired ground stations. Refer to the following table for an estimated timeline for execution:

| **Station** | **Qunicy** | **Chile** | **Sweden** | **South Africa** | **Singapore** |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Onboarding Timeframe | 3-6 months | 3-6 months | 3-6 months | <1 month | 3-6 months |

## Confirm spacecraft is authorized

1. In the Azure portal search box, enter **Spacecraft**. Select **Spacecraft** in the search results.
1. In the **Spacecraft** page, select the newly registered spacecraft.
1. In the new spacecraft's overview page, check that the **Authorization status** shows **Allowed**.
