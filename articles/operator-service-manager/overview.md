# About Azure Operator Service Manager

Azure Operator Service Manager is an Azure service designed to assist telecom operators in managing their network services. It provides streamlined management capabilities for intricate, multi-part, multi-vendor applications across numerous hybrid cloud sites, encompassing Azure regions, edge platforms, and Arc-connected sites. Initially, Azure Operator Service Manager caters to the needs of telecom operators who are in the process of migrating their workloads to Azure and Arc-connected cloud environments.

Azure Operator Service Manager expands and improves the Network Function Manager by incorporating technology and ideas from Azure for Operators' on-premises management tools. Its purpose is to manage the convergence of comprehensive, multi-vendor service solutions on a per-site basis. It uses a declarative software and configuration model for the system. 

## Product features

Azure Operator Service Manager provides an Azure-native abstraction for modeling and realizing a distributed network service using extra resource types in Azure Resource Manager (ARM) through our cloud service. A network service is represented as a network graph comprising multiple network functions, with appropriate policies controlling the data plane to meet each telecom operator's operational needs. Creation of templates of configuration schemas allows for per-site variation that is often required in such deployments.

## Benefits

Azure Operator Service Manager provides the following benefits:

- Provides a single management experience for all Azure for operators solutions in Azure or connected clouds.
- Provides blast-radius limitations and disconnected mode support to enable five-nines operation of these services.
- Enables real telecom DevOps working, eliminating the need for NF-specific maintenance windows.
