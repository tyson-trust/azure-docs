# Configure Azure CNI Powered by Cilium in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium combines the robust control plane of Azure CNI with the data plane of [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) to provide high-performance networking and security. 

By making use of eBPF programs loaded into the Linux kernel and a more efficient API object structure, Azure CNI Powered by Cilium provides the following benefits:

- Functionality equivalent to existing Azure CNI and Azure CNI Overlay plugins

- Faster service routing

- More efficient network policy enforcement

- Better observability of cluster traffic

- Support for larger clusters (more nodes, pods, and services)

## IP Address Management (IPAM) with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

Azure CNI Powered by Cilium can be deployed using two different methods for assigning pod IPs: 

- Assign IP addresses from a virtual network (similar to existing Azure CNI with Dynamic Pod IP Assignment)

- Assign IP addresses from an overlay network (similar to Azure CNI Overlay mode)

If you aren't sure which option to select, read ["Choosing a network model to use"](./azure-cni-overlay.md#choosing-a-network-model-to-use).

## Network Policy Enforcement

Cilium enforces [network policies to allow or deny traffic between pods](./operator-best-practices-network.md#control-traffic-flow-with-network-policies). With Cilium, you don't need to install a separate network policy engine such as Azure Network Policy Manager or Calico.

## Limitations

Azure CNI powered by Cilium currently has the following limitations:

* Available only for Linux and not for Windows.

* Cilium L7 policy enforcement is disabled.

* Hubble is disabled.

* Network policies cannot use `ipBlock` to allow access to node or pod IPs ([Cilium issue #9209](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/9209) and [#12277](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/12277)).

* Kubernetes services with `internalTrafficPolicy=Local` aren't supported ([Cilium issue #17796](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/17796)).

* Multiple Kubernetes services can't use the same host port with different protocols (for example, TCP or UDP) ([Cilium issue #14287](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/14287)).

* Network policies may be enforced on reply packets when a pod connects to itself via service cluster IP ([Cilium issue #19406](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/19406)).

## Prerequisites

* Azure CLI version 2.48.1 or later. Run `az --version` to see the currently installed version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

* If using ARM templates or the REST API, the AKS API version must be 2022-09-02-preview or later.

> [!NOTE]
> Previous AKS API versions (2022-09-02preview to 2023-01-02preview) used the field [`networkProfile.ebpfDataplane=cilium`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/06dbe269f7d9c709cc225c92358b38c3c2b74d60/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview/2022-09-02-preview/managedClusters.json#L6939-L6955). AKS API versions since 2023-02-02preview use the field [`networkProfile.networkDataplane=cilium`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/06dbe269f7d9c709cc225c92358b38c3c2b74d60/specification/containerservice/resource-manager/Microsoft.ContainerService/aks/preview/2023-02-02-preview/managedClusters.json#L7152-L7173) to enable Azure CNI Powered by Cilium.

## Create a new AKS Cluster with Azure CNI Powered by Cilium

### Option 1: Assign IP addresses from a virtual network

Run the following commands to create a resource group and virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods.

```azurecli-interactive
# Create the resource group
az group create --name <resourceGroupName> --location <location>
```

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a virtual network with a subnet for nodes and a subnet for pods
az network vnet create -g <resourceGroupName> --location <location> --name <vnetName> --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.0.0.0/8> -o none 
az network vnet subnet create -g <resourceGroupName> --vnet-name <vnetName> --name nodesubnet --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.240.0.0/16> -o none 
az network vnet subnet create -g <resourceGroupName> --vnet-name <vnetName> --name podsubnet --address-prefixes <address prefix, example: 10.241.0.0/16> -o none 
```

Create the cluster using `--network-dataplane cilium`:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -n <clusterName> -g <resourceGroupName> -l <location> \
  --max-pods 250 \
  --network-plugin azure \
  --vnet-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/nodesubnet \
  --pod-subnet-id /subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnetName>/subnets/podsubnet \
  --network-dataplane cilium
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--network-dataplane cilium` flag replaces the deprecated `--enable-ebpf-dataplane` flag used in earlier versions of the aks-preview CLI extension.

### Option 2: Assign IP addresses from an overlay network

Use the following commands to create a cluster with an overlay network and Cilium. Replace the values for `<clusterName>`, `<resourceGroupName>`, and `<location>`:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -n <clusterName> -g <resourceGroupName> -l <location> \
  --network-plugin azure \
  --network-plugin-mode overlay \
  --pod-cidr 192.168.0.0/16 \
  --network-dataplane cilium
```

## Frequently asked questions

- **Can I customize Cilium configuration?**

    No, AKS manages the Cilium configuration and it can't be modified. We recommend that customers who require more control use [AKS BYO CNI](./use-byo-cni.md) and install Cilium manually.

- **Can I use `CiliumNetworkPolicy` custom resources instead of Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources?**

    `CiliumNetworkPolicy` custom resources aren't officially supported. We recommend that customers use Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources to configure network policies.

- **Does AKS configure CPU or memory limits on the Cilium `daemonset`?**

    No, AKS doesn't configure CPU or memory limits on the Cilium `daemonset` because Cilium is a critical system component for pod networking and network policy enforcement.
