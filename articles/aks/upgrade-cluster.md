# Upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

Part of the AKS cluster lifecycle involves performing periodic upgrades to the latest Kubernetes version. It's important you apply the latest security releases, or upgrade to get the latest features. This article shows you how to check for, configure, and apply upgrades to your AKS cluster.

For AKS clusters that use multiple node pools or Windows Server nodes, see [Upgrade a node pool in AKS][nodepool-upgrade]. To upgrade a specific node pool without performing a Kubernetes cluster upgrade, see [Upgrade a specific node pool][specific-nodepool].

## Kubernetes version upgrades

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, Kubernetes minor versions can't be skipped. You must perform all upgrades sequentially by major version number. For example, upgrades between *1.14.x* -> *1.15.x* or *1.15.x* -> *1.16.x* are allowed, however *1.14.x* -> *1.16.x* isn't allowed.

Skipping multiple versions can only be done when upgrading from an *unsupported version* back to a *supported version*. For example, an upgrade from an unsupported *1.10.x* -> a supported *1.15.x* can be completed if available. When performing an upgrade from an *unsupported version* that skips two or more minor versions, the upgrade is performed without any guarantee of functionality and is excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. If your version is significantly out of date, we recommend you recreate your cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Any upgrade operation, whether performed manually or automatically, upgrades the node image version if not already using the latest version. The latest version is contingent on a full AKS release and can be determined by visiting the [AKS release tracker][release-tracker].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> An upgrade operation might fail if you made customizations to AKS agent nodes. For more information see our [Support policy][support-policy-user-customizations-agent-nodes].

## Before you begin

* If you're using Azure CLI, this article requires that you're running the Azure CLI version 2.34.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].
* If you're using Azure PowerShell, this tutorial requires that you're running Azure PowerShell version 5.9.0 or later. Run `Get-InstalledModule -Name Az` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell][azure-powershell-install].
* Performing upgrade operations requires the `Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools/write` RBAC role. For more on Azure RBAC roles, see the [Azure resource provider operations]

> [!WARNING]
> An AKS cluster upgrade triggers a cordon and drain of your nodes. If you have a low compute quota available, the upgrade may fail. For more information, see [increase quotas](../azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests.md).

## Check for available AKS cluster upgrades

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Check which Kubernetes releases are available for your cluster using the [`az aks get-upgrades`][az-aks-get-upgrades] command.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-upgrades --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --output table
```

The following example output shows that the cluster can be upgraded to versions *1.19.1* and *1.19.3*:

```output
Name     ResourceGroup    MasterVersion    Upgrades
-------  ---------------  ---------------  --------------
default  myResourceGroup  1.18.10          1.19.1, 1.19.3
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

Check which Kubernetes releases are available for your cluster using [`Get-AzAksUpgradeProfile`][get-azaksupgradeprofile] command.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzAksUpgradeProfile -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -ClusterName myAKSCluster |
Select-Object -Property Name, ControlPlaneProfileKubernetesVersion -ExpandProperty ControlPlaneProfileUpgrade |
Format-Table -Property *
```

The following example output shows that the cluster can be upgraded to versions *1.19.1* and *1.19.3*:

```output
Name    ControlPlaneProfileKubernetesVersion IsPreview KubernetesVersion
----    ------------------------------------ --------- -----------------
default 1.18.10                                        1.19.1
default 1.18.10                                        1.19.3
```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

Check which Kubernetes releases are available for your cluster using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to your AKS cluster.
3. Under **Settings**, select **Cluster configuration**.
4. In **Kubernetes version**, select **Upgrade version**.
5. In **Kubernetes version**, select the version to check for available upgrades.

The Azure portal highlights all the deprecated APIs between your current version and newer, available versions you intend to migrate to. For more information, see [the Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process][k8s-deprecation].

:::image type="content" source="./media/upgrade-cluster/portal-upgrade.png" alt-text="The screenshot of the upgrade blade for an AKS cluster in the Azure portal. The automatic upgrade field shows 'patch' selected, and several APIs deprecated between the selected Kubernetes version and the cluster's current version are described.":::

### Troubleshoot AKS cluster upgrade error messages

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The following example output means the `appservice-kube` extension isn't compatible with your Azure CLI version (a minimum of version 2.34.1 is required):

```output
The 'appservice-kube' extension is not compatible with this version of the CLI.
You have CLI core version 2.0.81 and this extension requires a min of 2.34.1.
Table output unavailable. Use the --query option to specify an appropriate query. Use --debug for more info.
```

If you receive this output, you need to update your Azure CLI version. The `az upgrade` command was added in version 2.11.0 and doesn't work with versions prior to 2.11.0. You can update older versions by reinstalling Azure CLI as described in [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). If your Azure CLI version is 2.11.0 or later, you receive a message to run `az upgrade` to upgrade Azure CLI to the latest version.

If your Azure CLI is updated and you receive the following example output, it means that no upgrades are available:

```output
ERROR: Table output unavailable. Use the --query option to specify an appropriate query. Use --debug for more info.
```

If no upgrades are available, create a new cluster with a supported version of Kubernetes and migrate your workloads from the existing cluster to the new cluster. It's not supported to upgrade a cluster to a newer Kubernetes version when `az aks get-upgrades` shows that no upgrades are available.

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

If no upgrades are available, create a new cluster with a supported version of Kubernetes and migrate your workloads from the existing cluster to the new cluster. It's not supported to upgrade a cluster to a newer Kubernetes version when `Get-AzAksUpgradeProfile` shows that no upgrades are available.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

If no upgrades are available, create a new cluster with a supported version of Kubernetes and migrate your workloads from the existing cluster to the new cluster. It's not supported to upgrade a cluster to a newer Kubernetes version when no upgrades are available.

## Upgrade an AKS cluster

During the cluster upgrade process, AKS performs the following operations:

* Add a new buffer node (or as many nodes as configured in [max surge](#customize-node-surge-upgrade)) to the cluster that runs the specified Kubernetes version.
* [Cordon and drain][kubernetes-drain] one of the old nodes to minimize disruption to running applications. If you're using max surge, it [cordons and drains][kubernetes-drain] as many nodes at the same time as the number of buffer nodes specified.
* When the old node is fully drained, it's reimaged to receive the new version and becomes the buffer node for the following node to be upgraded.
* This process repeats until all nodes in the cluster have been upgraded.
* At the end of the process, the last buffer node is deleted, maintaining the existing agent node count and zone balance.

[!INCLUDE [alias minor version callout](./includes/aliasminorversion/alias-minor-version-upgrade.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that any `PodDisruptionBudgets` (PDBs) allow for at least *one* pod replica to be moved at a time otherwise the drain/evict operation will fail.
> If the drain operation fails, the upgrade operation will fail by design to ensure that the applications are not disrupted. Please correct what caused the operation to stop (incorrect PDBs, lack of quota, and so on) and re-try the operation.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Upgrade your cluster using the [`az aks upgrade`][az-aks-upgrade] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks upgrade \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myAKSCluster \
        --kubernetes-version KUBERNETES_VERSION
    ```

2. Confirm the upgrade was successful using the [`az aks show`][az-aks-show] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --output table
    ```

    The following example output shows that the cluster now runs *1.19.1*:

    ```output
    Name          Location    ResourceGroup    KubernetesVersion    ProvisioningState    Fqdn
    ------------  ----------  ---------------  -------------------  -------------------  ----------------------------------------------
    myAKSCluster  eastus      myResourceGroup  1.19.1               Succeeded            myakscluster-dns-379cbbb9.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io
    ```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Upgrade your cluster using the [`Set-AzAksCluster`][set-azakscluster] command.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Set-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster -KubernetesVersion <KUBERNETES_VERSION>
    ```

2. Confirm the upgrade was successful using the [`Get-AzAksCluster`][get-azakscluster] command.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzAksCluster -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myAKSCluster |
     Format-Table -Property Name, Location, KubernetesVersion, ProvisioningState, Fqdn
    ```

    The following example output shows that the cluster now runs *1.19.1*:

    ```output
    Name         Location KubernetesVersion ProvisioningState Fqdn                                   
    ----         -------- ----------------- ----------------- ----                                   
    myAKSCluster eastus   1.19.1            Succeeded         myakscluster-dns-379cbbb9.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io
    ```

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to your AKS cluster.
3. Under **Settings**, select **Cluster configuration**.
4. In **Kubernetes version**, select **Upgrade version**.
5. In **Kubernetes version**, select your desired version and then select **Save**.
6. Navigate to your AKS cluster **Overview** page, and select the **Kubernetes version** to confirm the upgrade was successful.

The Azure portal highlights all the deprecated APIs between your current and newer version, and available versions you intend to migrate to. For more information, see [the Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process][k8s-deprecation].

:::image type="content" source="./media/upgrade-cluster/portal-upgrade.png" alt-text="The screenshot of the upgrade blade for an AKS cluster in the Azure portal. The automatic upgrade field shows 'patch' selected, and several APIs deprecated between the selected Kubernetes version and the cluster's current version are described.":::

## View the upgrade events

When you upgrade your cluster, the following Kubernetes events may occur on each node:

* **Surge**: Creates a surge node.
* **Drain**: Evicts pods from the node. Each pod has a 30-second timeout to complete the eviction.
* **Update**: Update of a node succeeds or fails.
* **Delete**: Deletes a surge node.

Use `kubectl get events` to show events in the default namespaces while running an upgrade. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get events 
```

The following example output shows some of the above events listed during an upgrade.

```output
...
default 2m1s Normal Drain node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000001 Draining node: [aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000001]
...
default 9m22s Normal Surge node/aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000002 Created a surge node [aks-nodepool1-96663640-vmss000002 nodepool1] for agentpool %!s(MISSING)
...
```

## Stop cluster upgrades automatically on API breaking changes (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview features callout](./includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

To stay within a supported Kubernetes version, you usually have to upgrade your cluster at least once per year and prepare for all possible disruptions. These disruptions include ones caused by API breaking changes, deprecations, and dependencies such as Helm and CSI. It can be difficult to anticipate these disruptions and migrate critical workloads without experiencing any downtime.

AKS now automatically stops upgrade operations consisting of a minor version change if deprecated APIs are detected. This feature alerts you with an error message if it detects usage of APIs that are deprecated in the targeted version.

All of the following criteria must be met in order for the stop to occur:

* The upgrade operation is a Kubernetes minor version change for the cluster control plane.
* The Kubernetes version you're upgrading to is 1.26 or later
* If performed via REST, the upgrade operation uses a preview API version of `2023-01-02-preview` or later.
* If performed via Azure CLI, the `aks-preview` CLI extension 0.5.134 or later must be installed.
* The last seen usage of deprecated APIs for the targeted version you're upgrading to must occur within 12 hours before the upgrade operation. AKS records usage hourly, so any usage of deprecated APIs within one hour isn't guaranteed to appear in the detection.
* Even API usage that is actually watching for deprecated resources is covered here. Look at the [Verb][k8s-api] for the distinction.

### Mitigating stopped upgrade operations

If you attempt an upgrade and all of the previous criteria are met, you receive an error message similar to the following example error message:

```output
Bad Request({
  "code": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Control Plane upgrade is blocked due to recent usage of a Kubernetes API deprecated in the specified version. Please refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide to migrate the usage. To bypass this error, set IgnoreKubernetesDeprecations in upgradeSettings.overrideSettings. Bypassing this error without migrating usage will result in the deprecated Kubernetes API calls failing. Usage details: 1 error occurred:\n\t* usage has been detected on API flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io.prioritylevelconfigurations.v1beta1, and was recently seen at: 2023-03-23 20:57:18 +0000 UTC, which will be removed in 1.26\n\n",
  "subcode": "UpgradeBlockedOnDeprecatedAPIUsage"
})
```

After receiving the error message, you have two options to mitigate the issue. You can either [remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)](#remove-usage-of-deprecated-apis-recommended) or [bypass validation to ignore API changes](#bypass-validation-to-ignore-api-changes).

### Remove usage of deprecated APIs (recommended)

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your cluster's overview page, and select **Diagnose and solve problems**.

2. Navigate to the **Known Issues, Availability and Performance** category, and select **Selected Kubernetes API deprecations**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/upgrade-cluster/applens-api-detection-inline.png" lightbox="./media/upgrade-cluster/applens-api-detection-full.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the Azure portal showing the 'Selected Kubernetes API deprecations' section.":::

3. Wait 12 hours from the time the last deprecated API usage was seen. Check the verb in the deprecated api usage to know if it is a [watch][k8s-api].

4. Retry your cluster upgrade.

You can also check past API usage by enabling [Container Insights][container-insights] and exploring kube audit logs. Check the verb in the deprecated api usage to understand, if it is a [watch][k8s-api] use case.

### Bypass validation to ignore API changes

> [!NOTE]
> This method requires you to use the `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension version 0.5.134 or later. This method isn't recommended, as deprecated APIs in the targeted Kubernetes version may not work long term. We recommend to removing them as soon as possible after the upgrade completes.

Bypass validation to ignore API breaking changes using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command and setting the `upgrade-settings` property to `IgnoreKubernetesDeprecations` and setting the `upgrade-override-until` property to define the end of the window during which validation is bypassed. If no value is set, it defaults the window to three days from the current time. The date and time you specify must be in the future.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --upgrade-settings IgnoreKubernetesDeprecations --upgrade-override-until 2023-04-01T13:00:00Z
```

> [!NOTE]
> `Z` is the zone designator for the zero UTC/GMT offset, also known as 'Zulu' time. This example sets the end of the window to `13:00:00` GMT. For more information, see [Combined date and time representations](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations).

## Customize node surge upgrade

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Node surges require subscription quota for the requested max surge count for each upgrade operation. For example, a cluster that has five node pools, each with a count of four nodes, has a total of 20 nodes. If each node pool has a max surge value of 50%, additional compute and IP quota of 10 nodes (2 nodes * 5 pools) is required to complete the upgrade.
>
> The max surge setting on a node pool is persistent.  Subsequent Kubernetes upgrades or node version upgrades will use this setting. You may change the max surge value for your node pools at any time. For production node pools, we recommend a max-surge setting of 33%.
>
> If you're using Azure CNI, validate there are available IPs in the subnet to [satisfy IP requirements of Azure CNI](configure-azure-cni.md).

By default, AKS configures upgrades to surge with one extra node. A default value of one for the max surge settings enables AKS to minimize workload disruption by creating an extra node before the cordon/drain of existing applications to replace an older versioned node. The max surge value can be customized per node pool to enable a trade-off between upgrade speed and upgrade disruption. When you increase the max surge value, the upgrade process completes faster. If you set a large value for max surge, you might experience disruptions during the upgrade process.

For example, a max surge value of *100%* provides the fastest possible upgrade process (doubling the node count) but also causes all nodes in the node pool to be drained simultaneously. You might want to use a higher value such as this for testing environments. For production node pools, we recommend a `max_surge` setting of *33%*.

AKS accepts both integer values and a percentage value for max surge. An integer such as *5* indicates five extra nodes to surge. A value of *50%* indicates a surge value of half the current node count in the pool. Max surge percent values can be a minimum of *1%* and a maximum of *100%*. A percent value is rounded up to the nearest node count. If the max surge value is higher than the required number of nodes to be upgraded, the number of nodes to be upgraded is used for the max surge value.

During an upgrade, the max surge value can be a minimum of *1* and a maximum value equal to the number of nodes in your node pool. You can set larger values, but the maximum number of nodes used for max surge isn't higher than the number of nodes in the pool at the time of upgrade.

### Set max surge values

Set max surge values for new or existing node pools using the following commands:

```azurecli-interactive
# Set max surge for a new node pool
az aks nodepool add -n mynodepool -g MyResourceGroup --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --max-surge 33%

# Update max surge for an existing node pool 
az aks nodepool update -n mynodepool -g MyResourceGroup --cluster-name MyManagedCluster --max-surge 5
```

## Set auto-upgrade channel

You can set an auto-upgrade channel on your cluster. For more information, see [Auto-upgrading an AKS cluster][aks-auto-upgrade].

## Special considerations for node pools that span multiple availability zones

AKS uses best-effort zone balancing in node groups. During an upgrade surge, the zones for the surge nodes in Virtual Machine Scale Sets are unknown ahead of time, which can temporarily cause an unbalanced zone configuration during an upgrade. However, AKS deletes surge nodes once the upgrade completes and preserves the original zone balance. If you want to keep your zones balanced during upgrades, you can increase the surge to a multiple of *three nodes*, and Virtual Machine Scale Sets balances your nodes across availability zones with best-effort zone balancing.

If you have PVCs backed by Azure LRS Disks, they'll be bound to a particular zone. They may fail to recover immediately if the surge node doesn't match the zone of the PVC. This could cause downtime on your application when the upgrade operation continues to drain nodes but the PVs are bound to a zone. To handle this case and maintain high availability, configure a [Pod Disruption Budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) on your application to allow Kubernetes to respect your availability requirements during the drain operation.

## Optimize upgrades to improve performance and minimize disruptions

The combination of [Planned Maintenance Window][planned-maintenance], [Max Surge](#customize-node-surge-upgrade), and [Pod Disruption Budget][pdb-spec] can significantly increase the likelihood of node upgrades completing successfully by the end of the maintenance window while also minimizing disruptions.

* [Planned Maintenance Window][planned-maintenance] enables service teams to schedule auto-upgrade during a pre-defined window, typically a low-traffic period, to minimize workload impact. A window duration of at least 4 hours is recommended.
* Max Surge on the node pool allows requesting additional quota during the upgrade process and limits the number of nodes selected for upgrade simultaneously. A higher max surge results in a faster upgrade process. However, setting it at 100% is not recommended as it would upgrade all nodes simultaneously, potentially causing disruptions to running applications. A max surge quota of 33% for production node pools is recommended.
*  [Pod Disruption Budget][pdb-spec] is set for service applications and limits the number of pods that can be down during voluntary disruptions, such as AKS-controlled node upgrades. It can be configured as `minAvailable` replicas, indicating the minimum number of application pods that need to be active, or `maxUnavailable` replicas, indicating the maximum number of application pods that can be terminated, ensuring high availability for the application. Refer to the guidance provided for configuring [Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)][pdb-concepts]. PDB values should be validated to determine the settings that work best for your specific service.
