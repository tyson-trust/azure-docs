# Use the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

The Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver allows for the integration of an Azure key vault as a secret store with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster via a [CSI volume][kube-csi].

## Features

* Mounts secrets, keys, and certificates to a pod using a CSI volume.
* Supports CSI inline volumes.
* Supports mounting multiple secrets store objects as a single volume.
* Supports pod portability with the `SecretProviderClass` CRD.
* Supports Windows containers.
* Syncs with Kubernetes secrets.
* Supports autorotation of mounted contents and synced Kubernetes secrets.

## Limitations

A container using *subPath volume mount* won't receive secret updates when it's rotated. For more information, see [Secrets Store CSI Driver known limitations](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/known-limitations.html#secrets-not-rotated-when-using-subpath-volume-mount).

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* Check that your version of the Azure CLI is 2.30.0 or later. If it's an earlier version, [install the latest version](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
* If you're restricting Ingress to the cluster, make sure ports **9808** and **8095** are open.
* The minimum recommended Kubernetes version is based on the [rolling Kubernetes version support window][kubernetes-version-support]. Make sure you're running version *N-2* or later.

## Create an AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver support

1. Create an Azure resource group using the [`az group create`][az-group-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create -n myResourceGroup -l eastus2
    ```

2. Create an AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver capability using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command and enable the `azure-keyvault-secrets-provider` add-on.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to use Azure AD workload identity, you must also use the `--enable-oidc-issuer` and `--enable-workload-identity` parameters, such as in the following example:
    >
    > ```azurecli-interactive
    > az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-oidc-issuer --enable-workload-identity
    > ```

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider
    ```

3. The add-on creates a user-assigned managed identity, `azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider`, to access Azure resources. The following example uses this identity to connect to the Azure key vault that stores the secrets, but you can also use other [identity access methods][identity-access-methods]. Take note of the identity's `clientId` in the output.

    ```json
    ...,
     "addonProfiles": {
        "azureKeyvaultSecretsProvider": {
          ...,
          "identity": {
            "clientId": "<client-id>",
            ...
          }
        }
    ```

## Upgrade an existing AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver support

* Upgrade an existing AKS cluster with Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver capability using the [`az aks enable-addons`][az-aks-enable-addons] command and enable the `azure-keyvault-secrets-provider` add-on. The add-on creates a user-assigned managed identity you can use to authenticate to your Azure key vault.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks enable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

## Verify the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver installation

1. Verify the installation is finished using the `kubectl get pods` command, which lists all pods with the `secrets-store-csi-driver` and `secrets-store-provider-azure` labels in the kube-system namespace.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l 'app in (secrets-store-csi-driver,secrets-store-provider-azure)'
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    aks-secrets-store-csi-driver-4vpkj       3/3     Running   2          4m25s
    aks-secrets-store-csi-driver-ctjq6       3/3     Running   2          4m21s
    aks-secrets-store-csi-driver-tlvlq       3/3     Running   2          4m24s
    aks-secrets-store-provider-azure-5p4nb   1/1     Running   0          4m21s
    aks-secrets-store-provider-azure-6pqmv   1/1     Running   0          4m24s
    aks-secrets-store-provider-azure-f5qlm   1/1     Running   0          4m25s
    ```

2. Verify that each node in your cluster's node pool has a Secrets Store CSI Driver pod and a Secrets Store Provider Azure pod running.

## Create or use an existing Azure key vault

1. Create an Azure key vault using the [`az keyvault create`][az-keyvault-create] command. The name of the key vault must be globally unique.

    ```azurecli
    az keyvault create -n <keyvault-name> -g myResourceGroup -l eastus2
    ```

2. Your Azure key vault can store keys, secrets, and certificates. In this example, use the [`az keyvault secret set`][az-keyvault-secret-set] command to set a plain-text secret called `ExampleSecret`.

    ```azurecli
    az keyvault secret set --vault-name <keyvault-name> -n ExampleSecret --value MyAKSExampleSecret
    ```

3. Take note of the following properties for use in the next section:

   * The name of the secret object in the key vault
   * The object type (secret, key, or certificate)
   * The name of your Azure key vault resource
   * The Azure tenant ID of the subscription

## Provide an identity to access the Azure key vault

The Secrets Store CSI Driver allows for the following methods to access an Azure key vault:

* An [Azure Active Directory workload identity][aad-workload-identity]
* A user-assigned or system-assigned managed identity

Follow the instructions in [Provide an identity to access the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver][identity-access-methods] for your chosen method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The rest of the examples on this page require that you followed the instructions in [Provide an identity to access the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver][identity-access-methods], chose one of the identity methods, and configured a `SecretProviderClass`. Come back to this page after completing those steps.

## Validate the secrets

After the pod starts, the mounted content at the volume path that you specified in your deployment YAML is available. Use the following commands to validate your secrets and print a test secret.

1. Show secrets held in the secrets store using the following command.

    ```bash
    kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-inline -- ls /mnt/secrets-store/
    ```

2. Display a secret in the store using the following command. This example command shows the test secret `ExampleSecret`.

    ```bash
    kubectl exec busybox-secrets-store-inline -- cat /mnt/secrets-store/ExampleSecret
    ```

## Obtain certificates and keys

The Azure Key Vault design makes sharp distinctions between keys, secrets, and certificates. The certificate features of the Key Vault service were designed to make use of key and secret capabilities. When you create a key vault certificate, it creates an addressable key and secret with the same name. The key allows key operations, and the secret allows the retrieval of the certificate value as a secret.

A key vault certificate also contains public x509 certificate metadata. The key vault stores both the public and private components of your certificate in a secret. You can obtain each individual component by specifying the `objectType` in `SecretProviderClass`. The following table shows which objects map to the various resources associated with your certificate:

| Object | Return value | Returns entire certificate chain |
|---|---|---|
|`key`|The public key, in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format.|N/A|
|`cert`|The certificate, in PEM format.|No|
|`secret`|The private key and certificate, in PEM format.|Yes|

## Disable the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver on an existing AKS cluster

> [!NOTE]
> Before you disable the add-on, ensure that *no* `SecretProviderClass` is in use. Trying to disable the add-on while a `SecretProviderClass` exists results in an error.

* Disable the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver capability in an existing cluster using the [`az aks disable-addons`][az-aks-disable-addons] command with the `azure-keyvault-secrets-provider` add-on.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks disable-addons --addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> When you disable the add-on, existing workloads should have no issues or see any updates in the mounted secrets. If the pod restarts or a new pod is created as part of scale-up event, the pod fails to start because the driver is no longer running.

## More configuration options

### Enable and disable autorotation

> [!NOTE]
> When the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver is enabled, it updates the pod mount and the Kubernetes secret defined in the `secretObjects` field of `SecretProviderClass`. It does so by polling for changes periodically, based on the rotation poll interval you defined. The default rotation poll interval is *two minutes*.

>[!NOTE]
> When a secret updates in an external secrets store after initial pod deployment, the Kubernetes Secret and the pod mount periodically update depending on how the application consumes the secret data.
>
> **Mount the Kubernetes Secret as a volume**: Use the autorotation and Sync K8s secrets features of Secrets Store CSI Driver. The application needs to watch for changes from the mounted Kubernetes Secret volume. When the CSI Driver updates the Kubernetes Secret, the corresponding volume contents automatically update as well.
>
> **Application reads the data from the container’s filesystem**: Use the rotation feature of Secrets Store CSI Driver. The application needs to watch for the file change from the volume mounted by the CSI driver.
>
> **Use the Kubernetes Secret for an environment variable**: Restart the pod to get the latest secret as an environment variable. Use a tool such as [Reloader][reloader] to watch for changes on the synced Kubernetes Secret and perform rolling upgrades on pods.

#### Enable autorotation on a new AKS cluster

* Enable autorotation of secrets on a new cluster using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command and enable the `enable-secret-rotation` add-on.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create -n myAKSCluster2 -g myResourceGroup --enable-addons azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-secret-rotation
    ```

#### Enable autorotation on an existing AKS cluster

* Update an existing cluster to enable autorotation of secrets using the [`az aks addon update`][az-aks-addon-update] command and the `enable-secret-rotation` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks addon update -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-secret-rotation
    ```

#### Specify a custom rotation interval

* Specify a custom rotation interval using the [`az aks addon update`][az-aks-addon-update] command with the `rotation-poll-interval` parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks addon update -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider --enable-secret-rotation --rotation-poll-interval 5m
    ```

#### Disable autorotation

To disable autorotation, you first need to disable the add-on. Then, you can re-enable the add-on without the `enable-secret-rotation` parameter.

1. Disable the secrets provider add-on using the [`az aks addon disable`][az-aks-addon-disable] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks addon disable -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider
    ```

2. Re-enable the secrets provider add-on without the `enable-secret-rotation` parameter using the [`az aks addon enable`][az-aks-addon-enable] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks addon enable -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster2 -a azure-keyvault-secrets-provider
    ```

### Sync mounted content with a Kubernetes secret

> [!NOTE]
> The YAML examples in this section are incomplete. You need to modify them to support your chosen method of access to your key vault identity. For details, see [Provide an identity to access the Azure Key Vault Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver][identity-access-methods].

You might want to create a Kubernetes secret to mirror your mounted secrets content. Your secrets sync after you start a pod to mount them. When you delete the pods that consume the secrets, your Kubernetes secret is also deleted.

* Sync mounted content with a Kubernetes secret using the `secretObjects` field when creating a `SecretProviderClass` to define the desired state of the Kubernetes secret, as shown in the following example YAML.

    ```yml
    apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
    kind: SecretProviderClass
    metadata:
      name: azure-sync
    spec:
      provider: azure                             
      secretObjects:                              # [OPTIONAL] SecretObjects defines the desired state of synced Kubernetes secret objects
      - data:
        - key: username                           # data field to populate
          objectName: foo1                        # name of the mounted content to sync; this could be the object name or the object alias
        secretName: foosecret                     # name of the Kubernetes secret object
        type: Opaque                              # type of Kubernetes secret object (for example, Opaque, kubernetes.io/tls)
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure the `objectName` in the `secretObjects` field matches the file name of the mounted content. If you use `objectAlias` instead, it should match the object alias.

#### Set an environment variable to reference Kubernetes secrets

> [!NOTE]
> The example YAML demonstrates access to a secret through env variables and volume/volumeMount. This is for illustrative purposes. A typical application would use one method or the other. However, be aware that in order for a secret to be available through env variables, it first must be mounted by at least one pod.

* Reference your newly created Kubernetes secret by setting an environment variable in your pod, as shown in the following example YAML.

    ```yml
    kind: Pod
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: busybox-secrets-store-inline
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: busybox
          image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/busybox:1.29-1 
          command:
            - "/bin/sleep"
            - "10000"
          volumeMounts:
          - name: secrets-store01-inline
            mountPath: "/mnt/secrets-store"
            readOnly: true
          env:
          - name: SECRET_USERNAME
            valueFrom:
              secretKeyRef:
                name: foosecret
                key: username
      volumes:
        - name: secrets-store01-inline
          csi:
            driver: secrets-store.csi.k8s.io
            readOnly: true
            volumeAttributes:
              secretProviderClass: "azure-sync"
    ```
