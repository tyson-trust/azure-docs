# Quickstart: Deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Azure CLI

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you quickly deploy and manage clusters. In this quickstart, you:

* Deploy an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI.
* Run a sample multi-container application with a web front end and a Redis instance in the cluster.

## Before you begin

* This quickstart assumes a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts. For more information, see [Kubernetes core concepts for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][kubernetes-concepts].
* You need an Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* To learn more about creating a Windows Server node pool, see [Create an AKS cluster that supports Windows Server containers](quick-windows-container-deploy-cli.md).

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

* This article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.64 or later. If you're using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
* Make sure the identity you use to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more details on access and identity for AKS, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][aks-identity-concepts].
* If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the appropriate subscription ID in which the resources should be billed using the [`az account`][az-account] command.
* Verify you have the *Microsoft.OperationsManagement* and *Microsoft.OperationalInsights* providers registered on your subscription. These Azure resource providers are required to support [Container insights][azure-monitor-containers]. Check the registration status using the following commands:

    ```azurecli
    az provider show -n Microsoft.OperationsManagement -o table
    az provider show -n Microsoft.OperationalInsights -o table
    ```

    If they're not registered, register them using the following commands:

    ```azurecli
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationsManagement
    az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to run the commands locally instead of in Azure Cloud Shell, make sure you run the commands with administrative privileges.

## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group][azure-resource-group] is a logical group in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. When you create a resource group, you're prompted to specify a location. This location is the storage location of your resource group metadata and where your resources run in Azure if you don't specify another region during resource creation.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

* Create a resource group using the [`az group create`][az-group-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
    ```

    The following output example resembles successful creation of the resource group:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup",
      "location": "eastus",
      "managedBy": null,
      "name": "myResourceGroup",
      "properties": {
        "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
      },
      "tags": null
    }
    ```

## Create an AKS cluster

The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one node and enables a system-assigned managed identity.

* Create an AKS cluster using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command with the `--enable-addons monitoring` parameter to enable [Azure Monitor Container insights][azure-monitor-containers] with managed identity authentication (Minimum Azure CLI version 2.49.0 or higher).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster --enable-managed-identity --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys
    ```

    After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create a new cluster, AKS automatically creates a second resource group to store the AKS resources. For more information, see [Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](../faq.md#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)

## Connect to the cluster

To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use the Kubernetes command-line client, [kubectl][kubectl]. `kubectl` is already installed if you use Azure Cloud Shell.

1. Install `kubectl` locally using the [`az aks install-cli`][az-aks-install-cli] command.

    ```azurecli
    az aks install-cli
    ```

2. Configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster using the [`az aks get-credentials`][az-aks-get-credentials] command.

    This command executes the following operations:

    * Downloads credentials and configures the Kubernetes CLI to use them.
    * Uses `~/.kube/config`, the default location for the [Kubernetes configuration file][kubeconfig-file]. Specify a different location for your Kubernetes configuration file using *--file* argument.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
    ```

3. Verify the connection to your cluster using the [`kubectl get`][kubectl-get] command. This command returns a list of the cluster nodes.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    The following output example shows the single node created in the previous steps. Make sure the node status is *Ready*.

    ```output
    NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
    aks-nodepool1-31718369-0   Ready    agent   6m44s   v1.12.8
    ```

## Deploy the application

A [Kubernetes manifest file][kubernetes-deployment] defines a cluster's desired state, such as which container images to run.

In this quickstart, you use a manifest to create all objects needed to run the [Azure Vote application][azure-vote-app]. This manifest includes two [Kubernetes deployments][kubernetes-deployment]:

* The sample Azure Vote Python applications.
* A Redis instance.

It also creates two [Kubernetes Services][kubernetes-service]:

* An internal service for the Redis instance.
* An external service to access the Azure Vote application from the internet.

1. Create a file named `azure-vote.yaml` and copy in the following manifest.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: azure-vote-back
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: azure-vote-back
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: azure-vote-back
        spec:
          nodeSelector:
            "kubernetes.io/os": linux
          containers:
          - name: azure-vote-back
            image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/bitnami/redis:6.0.8
            env:
            - name: ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD
              value: "yes"
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: 100m
                memory: 128Mi
              limits:
                cpu: 250m
                memory: 256Mi
            ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
              name: redis
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: azure-vote-back
    spec:
      ports:
      - port: 6379
      selector:
        app: azure-vote-back
    ---
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: azure-vote-front
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: azure-vote-front
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: azure-vote-front
        spec:
          nodeSelector:
            "kubernetes.io/os": linux
          containers:
          - name: azure-vote-front
            image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/azure-vote-front:v1
            resources:
              requests:
                cpu: 100m
                memory: 128Mi
              limits:
                cpu: 250m
                memory: 256Mi
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
            env:
            - name: REDIS
              value: "azure-vote-back"
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: azure-vote-front
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
      - port: 80
      selector:
        app: azure-vote-front
    ```

    For a breakdown of YAML manifest files, see [Deployments and YAML manifests](../concepts-clusters-workloads.md#deployments-and-yaml-manifests).

2. Deploy the application using the [`kubectl apply`][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest.

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f azure-vote.yaml
    ```

    The following example resembles output showing successfully created deployments and services.

    ```output
    deployment "azure-vote-back" created
    service "azure-vote-back" created
    deployment "azure-vote-front" created
    service "azure-vote-front" created
    ```

## Test the application

When the application runs, a Kubernetes service exposes the application front end to the internet. This process can take a few minutes to complete.

1. Monitor progress using the [`kubectl get service`][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl get service azure-vote-front --watch
    ```

    The **EXTERNAL-IP** output for the `azure-vote-front` service will initially show as *pending*.

    ```output
    NAME               TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   <pending>     80:30572/TCP   6s
    ```

2. Once the **EXTERNAL-IP** address changes from *pending* to an actual public IP address, use `CTRL-C` to stop the `kubectl` watch process.

    The following example output shows a valid public IP address assigned to the service:

    ```output
    azure-vote-front   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.27   52.179.23.131   80:30572/TCP   2m
    ```

3. Open a web browser to the external IP address of your service to see the Azure Vote app in action.

## Delete the cluster

If you don't plan on going through the following tutorials, clean up unnecessary resources to avoid Azure charges.

* Remove the resource group, container service, and all related resources using the [`az group delete`][az-group-delete] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes --no-wait
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The AKS cluster was created with a system-assigned managed identity, which is the default identity option used in this quickstart. The platform manages this identity so you don't need to manually remove it.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you deployed a Kubernetes cluster and deployed a simple multi-container application to it.
