# Free and Standard pricing tiers for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster management

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is now offering two pricing tiers for cluster management: the **Free tier** and the **Standard tier**. Both tiers are in the **Base** sku. 

|                  |Free tier|Standard tier|
|------------------|---------|--------|
|**When to use**|• You want to experiment with AKS at no extra cost <br> • You're new to AKS and Kubernetes|• You're running production or mission-critical workloads and need high availability and reliability <br> • You need a financially backed SLA|
|**Supported cluster types**|• Development clusters or small scale testing environments <br> • Clusters with fewer than 10 nodes|• Enterprise-grade or production workloads <br> • Clusters with up to 5,000 nodes|
|**Pricing**|• Free cluster management <br> • Pay-as-you-go for resources you consume|• Pay-as-you-go for resources you consume|
|**Feature comparison**|• Recommended for clusters with fewer than 10 nodes, but can support up to 1,000 nodes <br> • Includes all current AKS features|• Uptime SLA is enabled by default <br> • Greater cluster reliability and resources <br> • Can support up to 5,000 nodes in a cluster <br> • Includes all current AKS features

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Uptime SLA has been repositioned as a default feature included with the Standard tier.
>
> The repositioning will result in the following API changes:
>
> |         |Prior to 2023-02-01 API|Starting from 2023-02-01 API|
> |----------|-----------|------------|
> |ManagedClusterSKUName|"Basic"|"Base"|
> |ManagedClusterSKUTier|"Free" <br> "Paid"|"Free" <br> "Standard"|
>
> "Basic" and "Paid" are removed in the 2023-02-01 and 2023-02-02 Preview API version, and this will be a breaking change in API versions 2023-02-01 and 2023-02-02 Preview or newer. If you use automated scripts, CD pipelines, ARM templates, Terraform, or other third-party tooling that relies on the above parameters, please be sure to update the API parameters to use "Base" with "Free" or "Base" with "Standard" before upgrading to the 2023-02-01 and 2023-02-02 Preview API or newer API versions. 

For more information on pricing, see the [AKS pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/).

## Uptime SLA terms and conditions

In the Standard tier, the Uptime SLA feature is enabled by default per cluster. The Uptime SLA feature guarantees 99.95% availability of the Kubernetes API server endpoint for clusters using [Availability Zones][availability-zones], and 99.9% of availability for clusters that aren't using Availability Zones.For more information, see [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/kubernetes-service/v1_1/).

## Region availability

* Free tier and Standard tier are available in public regions and Azure Government regions where [AKS is supported](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=kubernetes-service).
* Free tier and Standard tier are available for [private AKS clusters][private-clusters] in all public regions where AKS is supported.

## Before you begin

[Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.47.0 or later and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

## Create a new cluster in the Free tier or Paid tier

Use the Azure CLI to create a new cluster on an AKS pricing tier. You can create your cluster in an existing resource group or create a new one. To learn more about resource groups and working with them, see [managing resource groups using the Azure CLI][manage-resource-group-cli].

Use the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command to create an AKS cluster. The commands below show you how to create a new resource group named *myResourceGroup* and a cluster named *myAKSCluster* in that resource group in each tier.

```azurecli-interactive
# Create a new AKS cluster in the Free tier

az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --tier free

# Create a new AKS cluster in the Standard tier

az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --tier standard
```

Once the deployment completes, it returns JSON-formatted information about your cluster:

```output
# Sample output for --tier free

  },
  "sku": {
    "name": "Base",
    "tier": "Free"
  },

# Sample output for --tier standard

  },
  "sku": {
    "name": "Base",
    "tier": "Standard"
  },
```

## Update the tier of an existing AKS cluster

The following example uses the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command to update the existing cluster.

```azurecli-interactive
# Update an existing cluster to the Free tier

az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --tier free

# Update an existing cluster to the Standard tier

az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --tier standard
```

This process takes several minutes to complete. When finished, the following example JSON snippet shows updating the existing cluster to the Standard tier in the Base SKU.

```output
  },
  "sku": {
    "name": "Base",
    "tier": "Standard"
  },
```

## Next steps

* Use [Availability Zones][availability-zones] to increase high availability with your AKS cluster workloads.
* Configure your cluster to [limit egress traffic](limit-egress-traffic.md).
