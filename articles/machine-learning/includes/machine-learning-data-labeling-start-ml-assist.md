ML-assisted labeling starts automatically after some items have been labeled. This automatic threshold varies by project. You can manually start an ML-assisted training run if your project contains at least some labeled data.

> [!NOTE]
> On-demand training is not available for projects created before December 2022. To use this feature, create a new project.

To start a new ML-assisted training run:

1. At the top of your project, select **Details**.
1. On the left menu, select **ML assisted labeling**.
1. Near the bottom of the page, for **On-demand training**, select **Start**.
