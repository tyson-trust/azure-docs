Select **Use a vendor labeling company from Azure Marketplace** only if you've engaged a data labeling company from [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/consulting-services?page=1&search=AzureMLVend). Then select the vendor. If your vendor doesn't appear in the list, clear this option.

Make sure that you first contact the vendor and sign a contract. For more information, see [Work with a data labeling vendor company (preview)](../how-to-outsource-data-labeling.md).

Select **Next** to continue.
