**Compute targets can be reused from one training job to the next.** For example, after you attach a remote VM to your workspace, you can reuse it for multiple jobs. For machine learning pipelines, use the appropriate [pipeline step](/python/api/azureml-pipeline-steps/azureml.pipeline.steps) for each compute target.

You can use any of the following resources for a training compute target for most jobs. Not all resources can be used for automated machine learning, machine learning pipelines, or designer. Azure Databricks can be used as a training resource for local runs and machine learning pipelines, but not as a remote target for other training.

> [!TIP]
> The compute instance has 120GB OS disk. If you run out of disk space, [use the terminal](~/articles/machine-learning/how-to-access-terminal.md) to clear at least 1-2 GB before you [stop or restart](~/articles/machine-learning/how-to-manage-compute-instance.md#manage) the compute instance.
