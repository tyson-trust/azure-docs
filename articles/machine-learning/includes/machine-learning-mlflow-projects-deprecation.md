> [!WARNING]
> Support for MLflow Projects in Azure Machine Learning will end on September 30, 2023. You'll be able to submit MLflow Projects (`MLproject` files) to Azure Machine Learning until that date.
>
> We recommend that you transition to Azure Machine Learning __Jobs__, using either the Azure CLI or the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python (v2) before September 2026, when MLflow Projects will be fully retired in Azure Machine Learning. For more information on Azure Machine Learning jobs, see [Track ML experiments and models with MLflow](../how-to-use-mlflow-cli-runs.md).
