> [!TIP]
> Azure Machine Learning also provides **managed virtual networks** (preview). With a managed virtual network, Azure Machine Learning handles the job of network isolation for your workspace and managed computes. You can also add private endpoints for resources needed by the workspace, such as Azure Storage Account. For more information, see [Workspace managed network isolation](../how-to-managed-network.md).
