# AutoML Text Classification

This article describes a component in Azure Machine Learning designer.

Use this component to create a machine learning model that is based on the AutoML Classification.

A text classification model will allow you to classify or categorize texts into predefined groups. Your dataset should be a labeled set of texts with their relevant tags that categorize each piece of text into a predefined group.


## How to configure 

This component trains an NLP classification model on text data. Text classification is a supervised learning task and requires a *labeled dataset* that includes a label column with a value for all rows.


This model requires a training and a Validation dataset. The datasets must be in ML Table format.



1.  Add the **AutoML Text Classification** component to your pipeline.

1.  Specify the **Target Column** you want the model to output 

1.  Specify the **Primary Metric** you want AutoML to use to measure your model's success.

1. (Optional) Select the language your dataset consists of. Visit this link for a [full list of supported languages.](../how-to-auto-train-nlp-models.md#language-settings

1. (Optional) You are able to configure Hyperparameters. Visit this link for a [full list of configurable Hyperparameters](../how-to-auto-train-nlp-models.md#supported-hyperparameters)

1. (Optional) Job Sweep settings are configurable. Visit this link to learn more about [each configurable parameter.](../how-to-auto-train-nlp-models.md#sampling-methods-for-the-sweep)

1. (Optional) Job Limit settings are configurable. Visit this link to learn more about [these settings.](../how-to-auto-train-nlp-models.md#resources-for-the-sweep)
