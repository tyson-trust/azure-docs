# Deploy and score a machine learning model by using an online endpoint

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

In this article, you'll learn to deploy your model to an online endpoint for use in real-time inferencing. You'll begin by deploying a model on your local machine to debug any errors. Then, you'll deploy and test the model in Azure. You'll also learn to view the deployment logs and monitor the service-level agreement (SLA). By the end of this article, you'll have a scalable HTTPS/REST endpoint that you can use for real-time inference.

Online endpoints are endpoints that are used for real-time inferencing. There are two types of online endpoints: **managed online endpoints** and **Kubernetes online endpoints**. For more information on endpoints and differences between managed online endpoints and Kubernetes online endpoints, see [What are Azure Machine Learning endpoints?](concept-endpoints-online.md#managed-online-endpoints-vs-kubernetes-online-endpoints).

Managed online endpoints help to deploy your ML models in a turnkey manner. Managed online endpoints work with powerful CPU and GPU machines in Azure in a scalable, fully managed way. Managed online endpoints take care of serving, scaling, securing, and monitoring your models, freeing you from the overhead of setting up and managing the underlying infrastructure.

The main example in this doc uses managed online endpoints for deployment. To use Kubernetes instead, see the notes in this document that are inline with the managed online endpoint discussion. 

## Prerequisites

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

[!INCLUDE [cli v2](includes/machine-learning-cli-v2.md)]

[!INCLUDE [basic prereqs cli](includes/machine-learning-cli-prereqs.md)]

* Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure Machine Learning. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __owner__ or __contributor__ role for the Azure Machine Learning workspace, or a custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/*`. If you use studio to create/manage online endpoints/deployments, you will need an additional permission "Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write" from the resource group owner. For more information, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md).

* (Optional) To deploy locally, you must [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your local computer. We *highly recommend* this option, so it's easier to debug issues.

### Virtual machine quota allocation for deployment

For managed online endpoints, Azure Machine Learning reserves 20% of your compute resources for performing upgrades. Therefore, if you request a given number of instances in a deployment, you must have a quota for `ceil(1.2 * number of instances requested for deployment) * number of cores for the VM SKU` available to avoid getting an error. For example, if you request 10 instances of a [Standard_DS3_v2](/azure/virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series) VM (that comes with 4 cores) in a deployment, you should have a quota for 48 cores (`12 instances * 4 cores`) available. To view your usage and request quota increases, see [View your usage and quotas in the Azure portal](how-to-manage-quotas.md#view-your-usage-and-quotas-in-the-azure-portal).

<!-- In this tutorial, you'll request one instance of a Standard_DS2_v2 VM SKU (that comes with 2 cores) in your deployment; therefore, you should have a minimum quota for 4 cores (`2 instances*2 cores`) available.  -->
---

## Prepare your system

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

### Set environment variables

If you haven't already set the defaults for the Azure CLI, save your default settings. To avoid passing in the values for your subscription, workspace, and resource group multiple times, run this code:

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <subscription ID>
   az configure --defaults workspace=<Azure Machine Learning workspace name> group=<resource group>
   ```

### Clone the examples repository

To follow along with this article, first clone the [examples repository (azureml-examples)](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples). Then, run the following code to go to the repository's `cli/` directory:

```azurecli
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
cd azureml-examples
cd cli
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `--depth 1` to clone only the latest commit to the repository, which reduces time to complete the operation.

The commands in this tutorial are in the files `deploy-local-endpoint.sh` and `deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh` in the `cli` directory, and the YAML configuration files are in the `endpoints/online/managed/sample/` subdirectory.

> [!NOTE]
> The YAML configuration files for Kubernetes online endpoints are in the `endpoints/online/kubernetes/` subdirectory.

# [Python](#tab/python)

### Clone the examples repository

To run the training examples, first clone the [examples repository (azureml-examples)](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) and change into the `azureml-examples/sdk/python/endpoints/online/managed` directory:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
cd azureml-examples/sdk/python/endpoints/online/managed
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `--depth 1` to clone only the latest commit to the repository, which reduces time to complete the operation.

The information in this article is based on the [online-endpoints-simple-deployment.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/managed/online-endpoints-simple-deployment.ipynb) notebook. It contains the same content as this article, although the order of the codes is slightly different.

### Connect to Azure Machine Learning workspace

The [workspace](concept-workspace.md) is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning. In this section, we'll connect to the workspace in which you'll perform deployment tasks. To follow along, open your `online-endpoints-simple-deployment.ipynb` notebook.

1. Import the required libraries:

    ```python
    # import required libraries
    from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import (
        ManagedOnlineEndpoint,
        ManagedOnlineDeployment,
        Model,
        Environment,
        CodeConfiguration,
    )
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're using the Kubernetes online endpoint, import the `KubernetesOnlineEndpoint` and `KubernetesOnlineDeployment` class from the `azure.ai.ml.entities` library.

1. Configure workspace details and get a handle to the workspace:

    To connect to a workspace, we need identifier parameters - a subscription, resource group and workspace name. We'll use these details in the `MLClient` from `azure.ai.ml` to get a handle to the required Azure Machine Learning workspace. This example uses the [default Azure authentication](/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential).

    ```python
    # enter details of your Azure Machine Learning workspace
    subscription_id = "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
    resource_group = "<RESOURCE_GROUP>"
    workspace = "<AZUREML_WORKSPACE_NAME>"
    ```

    ```python
    # get a handle to the workspace
    ml_client = MLClient(
        DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace
    )
    ```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

If you have Git installed on your local machine, you can follow the instructions to clone the examples repository. Otherwise, follow the instructions to download files from the examples repository.

### Clone the examples repository

To follow along with this article, first clone the [examples repository (azureml-examples)](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples) and then change into the `azureml-examples/cli/endpoints/online/model-1` directory.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
cd azureml-examples/cli/endpoints/online/model-1
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `--depth 1` to clone only the latest commit to the repository, which reduces time to complete the operation.

### Download files from the examples repository

If you cloned the examples repo, your local machine already has copies of the files for this example, and you can skip to the next section. If you didn't clone the repo, you can download it to your local machine.

1. Go to [https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/).
1. Go to the **<> Code** button on the page, and then select **Download ZIP** from the **Local** tab.
1. Locate the folder `/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/model` and the file `/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py`.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

### Set environment variables

Set the following environment variables, as they're used in the examples in this article. Replace the values with your Azure subscription ID, the Azure region where your workspace is located, the resource group that contains the workspace, and the workspace name:

```bash
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your Azure subscription ID"
export LOCATION="Azure region where your workspace is located"
export RESOURCE_GROUP="Azure resource group that contains your workspace"
export WORKSPACE="Azure Machine Learning workspace name"
```

A couple of the template examples require you to upload files to the Azure Blob store for your workspace. The following steps query the workspace and store this information in environment variables used in the examples:

1. Get an access token:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="get_access_token":::

1. Set the REST API version:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="api_version":::

1. Get the storage information:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="get_storage_details":::

### Clone the examples repository

To follow along with this article, first clone the [examples repository (azureml-examples)](https://github.com/azure/azureml-examples). Then, run the following code to go to the examples directory:

```azurecli
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples
cd azureml-examples
```

> [!TIP]
> Use `--depth 1` to clone only the latest commit to the repository, which reduces time to complete the operation.

## Define the endpoint

To define an endpoint, you need to specify:

* Endpoint name: The name of the endpoint. It must be unique in the Azure region. For more information on the naming rules, see [managed online endpoint limits](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).
* Authentication mode: The authentication method for the endpoint. Choose between key-based authentication and Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication. A key doesn't expire, but a token does expire. For more information on authenticating, see [Authenticate to an online endpoint](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).
* Optionally, you can add a description and tags to your endpoint.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

### Set an endpoint name

To set your endpoint name, run the following command (replace `YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME` with a unique name).

For Linux, run this command:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-local-endpoint.sh" ID="set_endpoint_name":::

### Configure the endpoint

The following snippet shows the *endpoints/online/managed/sample/endpoint.yml* file:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/managed/sample/endpoint.yml":::

The reference for the endpoint YAML format is described in the following table. To learn how to specify these attributes, see the [online endpoint YAML reference](reference-yaml-endpoint-online.md). For information about limits related to managed endpoints, see [Manage and increase quotas for resources with Azure Machine Learning](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).

| Key         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$schema`   | (Optional) The YAML schema. To see all available options in the YAML file, you can view the schema in the preceding code snippet in a browser.                                                                                                                   |
| `name`      | The name of the endpoint.                                               |
| `auth_mode` | Use `key` for key-based authentication. Use `aml_token` for Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication. To get the most recent token, use the `az ml online-endpoint get-credentials` command. |

# [Python](#tab/python)

### Configure an endpoint

In this article, we first define the name of the online endpoint.

```python
# Define an endpoint name
endpoint_name = "my-endpoint"

# Example way to define a random name
import datetime

endpoint_name = "endpt-" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M%f")

# create an online endpoint
endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(
    name = endpoint_name, 
    description="this is a sample endpoint"
    auth_mode="key"
)
```

For the authentication mode, we've used `key` for key-based authentication. To use Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication, use `aml_token`.

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

### Configure an endpoint

When you deploy to Azure, you'll create an endpoint and a deployment to add to it. At that time, you'll be prompted to provide names for the endpoint and deployment.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

### Set an endpoint name

To set your endpoint name, run the following command (replace `YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME` with a unique name).

For Linux, run this command:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" ID="set_endpoint_name":::

### Configure the endpoint

To define the endpoint and deployment, this article uses the Azure Resource Manager templates [online-endpoint.json](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/arm-templates/online-endpoint.json) and [online-endpoint-deployment.json](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/arm-templates/online-endpoint-deployment.json). To use the templates for defining an online endpoint and deployment, see the [Deploy to Azure](#deploy-to-azure) section.

---

## Define the deployment

A deployment is a set of resources required for hosting the model that does the actual inferencing. To deploy a model, you must have:

- Model files (or the name and version of a model that's already registered in your workspace). In the example, we have a scikit-learn model that does regression.
- A scoring script, that is, code that executes the model on a given input request. The scoring script receives data submitted to a deployed web service and passes it to the model. The script then executes the model and returns its response to the client. The scoring script is specific to your model and must understand the data that the model expects as input and returns as output. In this example, we have a *score.py* file.
- An environment in which your model runs. The environment can be a Docker image with Conda dependencies or a Dockerfile.
- Settings to specify the instance type and scaling capacity.

The following table describes the key attributes of a deployment:

| Attribute      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name           | The name of the deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Endpoint name  | The name of the endpoint to create the deployment under.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Model          | The model to use for the deployment. This value can be either a reference to an existing versioned model in the workspace or an inline model specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Code path      | The path to the directory on the local development environment that contains all the Python source code for scoring the model. You can use nested directories and packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Scoring script | The relative path to the scoring file in the source code directory. This Python code must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function. The `init()` function will be called after the model is created or updated (you can use it to cache the model in memory, for example). The `run()` function is called at every invocation of the endpoint to do the actual scoring and prediction. |
| Environment    | The environment to host the model and code. This value can be either a reference to an existing versioned environment in the workspace or an inline environment specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Instance type  | The VM size to use for the deployment. For the list of supported sizes, see [Managed online endpoints SKU list](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Instance count | The number of instances to use for the deployment. Base the value on the workload you expect. For high availability, we recommend that you set the value to at least `3`. We reserve an extra 20% for performing upgrades. For more information, see [managed online endpoint quotas](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).                                |

> [!NOTE]
> - The model and container image (as defined in Environment) can be referenced again at any time by the deployment when the instances behind the deployment go through security patches and/or other recovery operations. If you used a registered model or container image in Azure Container Registry for deployment and removed the model or the container image, the deployments relying on these assets can fail when reimaging happens. If you removed the model or the container image, ensure the dependent deployments are re-created or updated with alternative model or container image.
> - The container registry that the environment refers to can be private only if the endpoint identity has the permission to access it via Azure Active Directory authentication and Azure RBAC. For the same reason, private Docker registries other than Azure Container Registry are not supported.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

### Configure a deployment

The following snippet shows the *endpoints/online/managed/sample/blue-deployment.yml* file, with all the required inputs to configure a deployment:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/managed/sample/blue-deployment.yml":::

> [!NOTE]
> In the _blue-deployment.yml_ file, we've specified the following deployment attributes:
> * `model` - In this example, we specify the model properties inline using the `path`. Model files are automatically uploaded and registered with an autogenerated name.
> * `environment` - In this example, we have inline definitions that include the `path`. We'll use `environment.docker.image` for the image. The `conda_file` dependencies will be installed on top of the image.

During deployment, the local files such as the Python source for the scoring model, are uploaded from the development environment.

For more information about the YAML schema, see the [online endpoint YAML reference](reference-yaml-endpoint-online.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To use Kubernetes instead of managed endpoints as a compute target:
> 1. Create and attach your Kubernetes cluster as a compute target to your Azure Machine Learning workspace by using [Azure Machine Learning studio](how-to-attach-kubernetes-to-workspace.md).
> 1. Use the [endpoint YAML](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/cli/endpoints/online/kubernetes/kubernetes-endpoint.yml) to target Kubernetes instead of the managed endpoint YAML. You'll need to edit the YAML to change the value of `target` to the name of your registered compute target. You can use this [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/cli/endpoints/online/kubernetes/kubernetes-blue-deployment.yml) that has additional properties applicable to Kubernetes deployment.

> All the commands that are used in this article (except the optional SLA monitoring and Azure Log Analytics integration) can be used either with managed endpoints or with Kubernetes endpoints.

# [Python](#tab/python)

### Configure a deployment

To configure a deployment:

```python
model = Model(path="../model-1/model/sklearn_regression_model.pkl")
env = Environment(
    conda_file="../model-1/environment/conda.yml",
    image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
)

blue_deployment = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
    name="blue",
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    model=model,
    environment=env,
    code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(
        code="../model-1/onlinescoring", scoring_script="score.py"
    ),
    instance_type="Standard_DS3_v2",
    instance_count=1,
)
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

### Configure a deployment

When you deploy to Azure, you'll create an endpoint and a deployment to add to it. At that time, you'll be prompted to provide names for the endpoint and deployment.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

### Configure the deployment

To define the endpoint and deployment, this article uses the Azure Resource Manager templates [online-endpoint.json](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/arm-templates/online-endpoint.json) and [online-endpoint-deployment.json](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/arm-templates/online-endpoint-deployment.json). To use the templates for defining an online endpoint and deployment, see the [Deploy to Azure](#deploy-to-azure) section.

### Register your model and environment separately

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

In this example, we specify the `path` (where to upload files from) inline. The CLI automatically uploads the files and registers the model and environment. As a best practice for production, you should register the model and environment and specify the registered name and version separately in the YAML. Use the form `model: azureml:my-model:1` or `environment: azureml:my-env:1`.

For registration, you can extract the YAML definitions of `model` and `environment` into separate YAML files and use the commands `az ml model create` and `az ml environment create`. To learn more about these commands, run `az ml model create -h` and `az ml environment create -h`.

For more information on registering your model as an asset, see [Register your model as an asset in Machine Learning by using the CLI](how-to-manage-models.md#register-your-model-as-an-asset-in-machine-learning-by-using-the-cli). For more information on creating an environment, see [Manage Azure Machine Learning environments with the CLI & SDK (v2)](how-to-manage-environments-v2.md#create-an-environment).

# [Python](#tab/python)

In this example, we specify the `path` (where to upload files from) inline. The SDK automatically uploads the files and registers the model and environment. As a best practice for production, you should register the model and environment and specify the registered name and version separately in the codes.

For more information on registering your model as an asset, see [Register your model as an asset in Machine Learning by using the SDK](how-to-manage-models.md#register-your-model-as-an-asset-in-machine-learning-by-using-the-sdk).

For more information on creating an environment, see [Manage Azure Machine Learning environments with the CLI & SDK (v2)](how-to-manage-environments-v2.md#create-an-environment).

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

### Register the model

A model registration is a logical entity in the workspace that may contain a single model file or a directory of multiple files. As a best practice for production, you should register the model and environment. When creating the endpoint and deployment in this article, we'll assume that you've registered the [model folder](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/tree/main/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/model) that contains the model.

To register the example model, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).
1. In the left navigation bar, select the **Models** page.
1. Select **Register**, and then choose **From local files**.
1. Select __Unspecified type__ for the __Model type__.
1. Select __Browse__, and choose __Browse folder__.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/register-model-folder.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the browse folder option." lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/register-model-folder.png":::

1. Select the `\azureml-examples\cli\endpoints\online\model-1\model` folder from the local copy of the repo you cloned or downloaded earlier. When prompted, select __Upload__ and wait for the upload to complete.
1. Select __Next__ after the folder upload is completed.
1. Enter a friendly __Name__ for the model. The steps in this article assume the model is named `model-1`.
1. Select __Next__, and then __Register__ to complete registration.

For more information on working with registered models, see [Register and work with models](how-to-manage-models.md).

For information on creating an environment in the studio, see [Create an environment](how-to-manage-environments-in-studio.md#create-an-environment).

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

1. To register the model using a template, you must first upload the model file to an Azure Blob store. The following example uses the `az storage blob upload-batch` command to upload a file to the default storage for your workspace:

    :::code language="{language}" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="upload_model":::

1. After uploading the file, use the template to create a model registration. In the following example, the `modelUri` parameter contains the path to the model:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="create_model":::

1. Part of the environment is a conda file that specifies the model dependencies needed to host the model. The following example demonstrates how to read the contents of the conda file into environment variables:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="read_condafile":::

1. The following example demonstrates how to use the template to register the environment. The contents of the conda file from the previous step are passed to the template using the `condaFile` parameter:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="create_environment":::

---

### Use different CPU and GPU instance types and images

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The preceding definition in the _blue-deployment.yml_ file uses a general-purpose type `Standard_DS3_v2` instance and a non-GPU Docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest`. For GPU compute, choose a GPU compute type SKU and a GPU Docker image.

For supported general-purpose and GPU instance types, see [Managed online endpoints supported VM SKUs](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md). For a list of Azure Machine Learning CPU and GPU base images, see [Azure Machine Learning base images](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers).

> [!NOTE]
> To use Kubernetes instead of managed endpoints as a compute target, see [Introduction to Kubernetes compute target](./how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere.md).

# [Python](#tab/python)

The preceding definition of the `blue_deployment` uses a general-purpose type `Standard_DS3_v2` instance and a non-GPU Docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest`. For GPU compute, choose a GPU compute type SKU and a GPU Docker image.

> [!NOTE]
> To use Kubernetes instead of managed endpoints as a compute target, see [Introduction to Kubernetes compute target](./how-to-attach-kubernetes-anywhere.md).

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

When using the studio to deploy to Azure, you'll be prompted to specify the compute properties (instance type and instance count) and environment to use for your deployment.

For supported general-purpose and GPU instance types, see [Managed online endpoints supported VM SKUs](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md). For more information on environments, see [Manage software environments in Azure Machine Learning studio](how-to-manage-environments-in-studio.md).

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The preceding registration of the environment specifies a non-GPU docker image `mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi3.1.2-ubuntu18.04` by passing the value to the `environment-version.json` template using the `dockerImage` parameter. For a GPU compute, provide a value for a GPU docker image to the template (using the `dockerImage` parameter) and provide a GPU compute type SKU to the `online-endpoint-deployment.json` template (using the `skuName` parameter).

For supported general-purpose and GPU instance types, see [Managed online endpoints supported VM SKUs](reference-managed-online-endpoints-vm-sku-list.md). For a list of Azure Machine Learning CPU and GPU base images, see [Azure Machine Learning base images](https://github.com/Azure/AzureML-Containers).

---

### Use more than one model in a deployment

Currently, you can specify only one model per deployment in the deployment definition when you use the Azure CLI, Python SDK, or any of the other client tools.

To use more than one model in a deployment, register a model folder that contains all the models as files or subdirectories. In your scoring script, use the environment variable `AZUREML_MODEL_DIR` to get the path to the model root folder. The underlying directory structure will be retained. For an example of deploying multiple models to one deployment, see [Deploy multiple models to one deployment (CLI example)](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/cli/endpoints/online/custom-container/minimal/multimodel) and [Deploy multiple models to one deployment (SDK example)](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/custom-container/online-endpoints-custom-container-multimodel.ipynb).

> [!TIP]
> If you have more than 1500 files to register, you may consider compressing the files or subdirectories as .tar.gz when registering the model. To consume the models, you can uncompress the files or subdirectories in the init() function from the scoring script. Alternatively, when you register the model, set the `azureml.unpack` property to `True`, which will allow automatic uncompression. In either case, uncompression happens once in the initialization stage.

---

## Understand the scoring script

> [!TIP]
> The format of the scoring script for online endpoints is the same format that's used in the preceding version of the CLI and in the Python SDK.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
As noted earlier, the scoring script specified in `code_configuration.scoring_script` must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function.

# [Python](#tab/python)
The scoring script must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function.

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)
The scoring script must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The scoring script must have an `init()` function and a `run()` function. This example uses the [score.py file](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py). 

When using a template for deployment, you must first upload the scoring file(s) to an Azure Blob store, and then register it:

1. The following example uses the Azure CLI command `az storage blob upload-batch` to upload the scoring file(s):

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="upload_code":::

1. The following example demonstrates how to register the code using a template:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="create_code":::

---

This example uses the [score.py file](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py):
__score.py__
:::code language="python" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py" :::

The `init()` function is called when the container is initialized or started. Initialization typically occurs shortly after the deployment is created or updated. The `init` function is the place to write logic for global initialization operations like caching the model in memory (as we do in this example).

The `run()` function is called for every invocation of the endpoint, and it does the actual scoring and prediction. In this example, we'll extract data from a JSON input, call the scikit-learn model's `predict()` method, and then return the result.

## Deploy and debug locally by using local endpoints

We *highly recommend* that you test-run your endpoint locally by validating and debugging your code and configuration before you deploy to Azure. Azure CLI and Python SDK support local endpoints and deployments, while Azure Machine Learning studio and ARM template don't.

To deploy locally, [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) must be installed and running. Docker Engine typically starts when the computer starts. If it doesn't, you can [troubleshoot Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/#start-the-daemon-manually).

> [!TIP]
> You can use [Azure Machine Learning inference HTTP server Python package](how-to-inference-server-http.md) to debug your scoring script locally **without Docker Engine**. Debugging with the inference server helps you to debug the scoring script before deploying to local endpoints so that you can debug without being affected by the deployment container configurations.

Local endpoints have the following limitations:
- They do *not* support traffic rules, authentication, or probe settings. 
- They support only one deployment per endpoint.
- They support local model files only. If you want to test registered models, first download them using [CLI](/cli/azure/ml/model#az-ml-model-download) or [SDK](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.operations.modeloperations#azure-ai-ml-operations-modeloperations-download), then use `path` in the deployment definition to refer to the parent folder.

For more information on debugging online endpoints locally before deploying to Azure, see [Debug online endpoints locally in Visual Studio Code](how-to-debug-managed-online-endpoints-visual-studio-code.md).

### Deploy the model locally

First create an endpoint. Optionally, for a local endpoint, you can skip this step and directly create the deployment (next step), which will, in turn, create the required metadata. Deploying models locally is useful for development and testing purposes.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-local-endpoint.sh" ID="create_endpoint":::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint, local=True)
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

The studio doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The template doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

---

Now, create a deployment named `blue` under the endpoint.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-local-endpoint.sh" ID="create_deployment":::

The `--local` flag directs the CLI to deploy the endpoint in the Docker environment.

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(
    deployment=blue_deployment, local=True
)
```

The `local=True` flag directs the SDK to deploy the endpoint in the Docker environment.

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

The studio doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The template doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

---

> [!TIP]
> Use Visual Studio Code to test and debug your endpoints locally. For more information, see [debug online endpoints locally in Visual Studio Code](how-to-debug-managed-online-endpoints-visual-studio-code.md).

### Verify the local deployment succeeded

Check the status to see whether the model was deployed without error:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-local-endpoint.sh" ID="get_status":::

The output should appear similar to the following JSON. The `provisioning_state` is `Succeeded`.

```json
{
  "auth_mode": "key",
  "location": "local",
  "name": "docs-endpoint",
  "properties": {},
  "provisioning_state": "Succeeded",
  "scoring_uri": "http://localhost:49158/score",
  "tags": {},
  "traffic": {}
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.get(name=endpoint_name, local=True)
```

The method returns [`ManagedOnlineEndpoint` entity](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.managedonlineendpoint). The `provisioning_state` is `Succeeded`.

```
ManagedOnlineEndpoint({'public_network_access': None, 'provisioning_state': 'Succeeded', 'scoring_uri': 'http://localhost:49158/score', 'swagger_uri': None, 'name': 'endpt-10061534497697', 'description': 'this is a sample endpoint', 'tags': {}, 'properties': {}, 'id': None, 'Resource__source_path': None, 'base_path': '/path/to/your/working/directory', 'creation_context': None, 'serialize': <msrest.serialization.Serializer object at 0x7ffb781bccd0>, 'auth_mode': 'key', 'location': 'local', 'identity': None, 'traffic': {}, 'mirror_traffic': {}, 'kind': None})
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

The studio doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The template doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

---

The following table contains the possible values for `provisioning_state`:

| State         | Description                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| __Creating__  | The resource is being created.                 |
| __Updating__  | The resource is being updated.                 |
| __Deleting__  | The resource is being deleted.                 |
| __Succeeded__ | The create/update operation was successful.    |
| __Failed__    | The create/update/delete operation has failed. |

### Invoke the local endpoint to score data by using your model

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

Invoke the endpoint to score the model by using the convenience command `invoke` and passing query parameters that are stored in a JSON file:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-local-endpoint.sh" ID="test_endpoint":::

If you want to use a REST client (like curl), you must have the scoring URI. To get the scoring URI, run `az ml online-endpoint show --local -n $ENDPOINT_NAME`. In the returned data, find the `scoring_uri` attribute. Sample curl based commands are available later in this doc.

# [Python](#tab/python)

Invoke the endpoint to score the model by using the convenience command invoke and passing query parameters that are stored in a JSON file

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    request_file="../model-1/sample-request.json",
    local=True,
)
```

If you want to use a REST client (like curl), you must have the scoring URI. To get the scoring URI, run the following code. In the returned data, find the `scoring_uri` attribute. Sample curl based commands are available later in this doc.

```python
endpoint = ml_client.online_endpoints.get(endpoint_name, local=True)
scoring_uri = endpoint.scoring_uri
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

The studio doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The template doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

---

### Review the logs for output from the invoke operation

In the example *score.py* file, the `run()` method logs some output to the console. 

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can view this output by using the `get-logs` command:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-local-endpoint.sh" ID="get_logs":::

# [Python](#tab/python)

You can view this output by using the `get_logs` method:

```python
ml_client.online_deployments.get_logs(
    name="blue", endpoint_name=endpoint_name, local=True, lines=50
)
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

The studio doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

The template doesn't support local endpoints. See the Azure CLI or Python tabs for steps to test the endpoint locally.

---

##  Deploy your online endpoint to Azure

Next, deploy your online endpoint to Azure.

### Deploy to Azure

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To create the endpoint in the cloud, run the following code:

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="create_endpoint" :::

To create the deployment named `blue` under the endpoint, run the following code:

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="create_deployment" :::

This deployment might take up to 15 minutes, depending on whether the underlying environment or image is being built for the first time. Subsequent deployments that use the same environment will finish processing more quickly.

> [!TIP]
> * If you prefer not to block your CLI console, you may add the flag `--no-wait` to the command. However, this will stop the interactive display of the deployment status.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--all-traffic` flag in the above `az ml online-deployment create` allocates 100% of the endpoint traffic to the newly created blue deployment. Though this is helpful for development and testing purposes, for production, you might want to open traffic to the new deployment through an explicit command. For example, `az ml online-endpoint update -n $ENDPOINT_NAME --traffic "blue=100"`.

# [Python](#tab/python)

1. Create the endpoint:

    Using the `endpoint` we defined earlier and the `MLClient` created earlier, we'll now create the endpoint in the workspace. This command will start the endpoint creation and return a confirmation response while the endpoint creation continues.

    ```python
    ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint)
    ```

1. Create the deployment:

    Using the `blue_deployment` that we defined earlier and the `MLClient` we created earlier, we'll now create the deployment in the workspace. This command will start the deployment creation and return a confirmation response while the deployment creation continues.

    ```python
    ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment)
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > * If you prefer not to block your Python console, you may add the flag `no_wait=True` to the parameters. However, this will stop the interactive display of the deployment status.

    ```python
    # blue deployment takes 100 traffic
    endpoint.traffic = {"blue": 100}
    ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint)
    ```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

### Create a managed online endpoint and deployment

Use the studio to create a managed online endpoint directly in your browser. When you create a managed online endpoint in the studio, you must define an initial deployment. You can't create an empty managed online endpoint.

One way to create a managed online endpoint in the studio is from the **Models** page. This method also provides an easy way to add a model to an existing managed online deployment. To deploy the model named `model-1` that you registered previously in the [Register the model](#register-the-model) section:

1. Go to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).
1. In the left navigation bar, select the **Models** page.
1. Select the model named `model-1` by checking the circle next to its name.
1. Select **Deploy** > **Deploy to real-time endpoint**.

    This action opens up a window where you can specify details about your endpoint.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/online-endpoint-wizard.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/online-endpoint-wizard.png" alt-text="A screenshot of a managed online endpoint create wizard.":::

1. Enter an __Endpoint name__.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * Endpoint name: The name of the endpoint. It must be unique in the Azure region. For more information on the naming rules, see [managed online endpoint limits](how-to-manage-quotas.md#azure-machine-learning-managed-online-endpoints).
    > * Authentication type: The authentication method for the endpoint. Choose between key-based authentication and Azure Machine Learning token-based authentication. A `key` doesn't expire, but a token does expire. For more information on authenticating, see [Authenticate to an online endpoint](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).
    > * Optionally, you can add a description and tags to your endpoint.

1. Keep the default selections: __Managed__ for the compute type and __key-based authentication__ for the authentication type.
1. Select __Next__, until you get to the "Deployment" page. Here, toggle __Application Insights diagnostics__ to Enabled to allow you to view graphs of your endpoint's activities in the studio later and analyze metrics and logs using Application Insights.
1. Select __Next__ to go to the "Environment" page. Here, select the following options:

    * __Select scoring file and dependencies__: Browse and select the `\azureml-examples\cli\endpoints\online\model-1\onlinescoring\score.py` file from the repo you cloned or downloaded earlier.
    * __Choose an environment__ section: Select the **Scikit-learn 0.24.1** curated environment.

1. Select __Next__, accepting defaults, until you're prompted to create the deployment.
1. Review your deployment settings and select the __Create__ button.

Alternatively, you can create a managed online endpoint from the **Endpoints** page in the studio.

1. Go to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).
1. In the left navigation bar, select the **Endpoints** page.
1. Select **+ Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/endpoint-create-managed-online-endpoint.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/endpoint-create-managed-online-endpoint.png" alt-text="A screenshot for creating managed online endpoint from the Endpoints tab.":::

This action opens up a window for you to specify details about your endpoint and deployment. Enter settings for your endpoint and deployment as described in the previous steps 5-10, accepting defaults until you're prompted to __Create__  the deployment.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

1. The following example demonstrates using the template to create an online endpoint:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="create_endpoint":::

1. After the endpoint has been created, the following example demonstrates how to deploy the model to the endpoint:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/deploy-arm-templates-az-cli.sh" id="create_deployment":::

---

> [!TIP]
> * Use [Troubleshooting online endpoints deployment](./how-to-troubleshoot-online-endpoints.md) to debug errors.

### Check the status of the endpoint

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

The `show` command contains information in `provisioning_state` for the endpoint and deployment:

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="get_status" :::

You can list all the endpoints in the workspace in a table format by using the `list` command:

```azurecli
az ml online-endpoint list --output table
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

Check the status to see whether the model was deployed without error:

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.get(name=endpoint_name)
```

You can list all the endpoints in the workspace in a table format by using the `list` method:

```python
for endpoint in ml_client.online_endpoints.list():
    print(endpoint.name)
```

The method returns a list (iterator) of `ManagedOnlineEndpoint` entities. You can get other information by specifying [parameters](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.entities.managedonlineendpoint#parameters).

For example, output the list of endpoints like a table:

```python
print("Kind\tLocation\tName")
print("-------\t----------\t------------------------")
for endpoint in ml_client.online_endpoints.list():
    print(f"{endpoint.kind}\t{endpoint.location}\t{endpoint.name}")
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

### View managed online endpoints

You can view all your managed online endpoints in the **Endpoints** page. Go to the endpoint's **Details** page to find critical information including the endpoint URI, status, testing tools, activity monitors, deployment logs, and sample consumption code:

1. In the left navigation bar, select **Endpoints**. Here, you can see a list of all the endpoints in the workspace.
1. (Optional) Create a **Filter** on **Compute type** to show only **Managed** compute types.
1. Select an endpoint name to view the endpoint's __Details__ page.

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

> [!TIP]
> While templates are useful for deploying resources, they can't be used to list, show, or invoke resources. Use the Azure CLI, Python SDK, or the studio to perform these operations. The following code uses the Azure CLI.

The `show` command contains information in the `provisioning_state` for the endpoint and deployment:

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="get_status" :::

You can list all the endpoints in the workspace in a table format by using the `list` command:

```azurecli
az ml online-endpoint list --output table
```

---

### Check the status of the online deployment

Check the logs to see whether the model was deployed without error.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To see log output from a container, use the following CLI command:

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="get_logs" :::

By default, logs are pulled from the inference server container. To see logs from the storage initializer container, add the `--container storage-initializer` flag. For more information on deployment logs, see [Get container logs](how-to-troubleshoot-online-endpoints.md#get-container-logs).


# [Python](#tab/python)

You can view this output by using the `get_logs` method:

```python
ml_client.online_deployments.get_logs(
    name="blue", endpoint_name=endpoint_name, lines=50
)
```

By default, logs are pulled from the inference server container. To see logs from the storage initializer container, add the `container_type="storage-initializer"` option. For more information on deployment logs, see [Get container logs](how-to-troubleshoot-online-endpoints.md#get-container-logs).

```python
ml_client.online_deployments.get_logs(
    name="blue", endpoint_name=endpoint_name, lines=50, container_type="storage-initializer"
)
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

To view log output, select the **Deployment logs** tab in the endpoint's **Details** page. If you have multiple deployments in your endpoint, use the dropdown to select the deployment whose log you want to see.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/deployment-logs.png" lightbox="media/how-to-deploy-online-endpoints/deployment-logs.png" alt-text="A screenshot of observing deployment logs in the studio.":::

By default, logs are pulled from the inference server. To see logs from the storage initializer container, use the Azure CLI or Python SDK (see each tab for details). For more information on deployment logs, see [Get container logs](how-to-troubleshoot-online-endpoints.md#get-container-logs).

### Invoke the endpoint to score data by using your model

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

You can use either the `invoke` command or a REST client of your choice to invoke the endpoint and score some data: 

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="test_endpoint" :::

The following example shows how to get the key used to authenticate to the endpoint:

> [!TIP]
> You can control which Azure Active Directory security principals can get the authentication key by assigning them to a custom role that allows `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/token/action` and `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/listkeys/action`. For more information, see [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-assign-roles.md).

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="test_endpoint_using_curl_get_key":::

Next, use curl to score data.

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="test_endpoint_using_curl" :::

Notice we use `show` and `get-credentials` commands to get the authentication credentials. Also notice that we're using the `--query` flag to filter attributes to only what we need. To learn more about `--query`, see [Query Azure CLI command output](/cli/azure/query-azure-cli).

To see the invocation logs, run `get-logs` again.

For information on authenticating using a token, see [Authenticate to online endpoints](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).

# [Python](#tab/python)

Using the `MLClient` created earlier, we'll get a handle to the endpoint. The endpoint can be invoked using the `invoke` command with the following parameters:

* `endpoint_name` - Name of the endpoint
* `request_file` - File with request data
* `deployment_name` - Name of the specific deployment to test in an endpoint

We'll send a sample request using a [json](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/model-1/sample-request.json) file.

```python
# test the blue deployment with some sample data
ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
    endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
    deployment_name="blue",
    request_file="../model-1/sample-request.json",
)
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

Use the **Test** tab in the endpoint's details page to test your managed online deployment. Enter sample input and view the results.

1. Select the **Test** tab in the endpoint's detail page.
1. Use the dropdown to select the deployment you want to test.
1. Enter sample input.
1. Select **Test**.

```azurecli
az ml online-endpoint invoke --name $ENDPOINT_NAME --request-file cli/endpoints/online/model-1/sample-request.json
```

---

### (Optional) Update the deployment

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

If you want to update the code, model, or environment, update the YAML file, and then run the `az ml online-endpoint update` command.

> [!NOTE]
> If you update instance count (to scale your deployment) along with other model settings (such as code, model, or environment) in a single `update` command, the scaling operation will be performed first, then the other updates will be applied. It's a good practice to perform these operations separately in a production environment.

To understand how `update` works:

1. Open the file *online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py*.
1. Change the last line of the `init()` function: After `logging.info("Init complete")`, add `logging.info("Updated successfully")`. 
1. Save the file.
1. Run this command:

    ```azurecli
    az ml online-deployment update -n blue --endpoint $ENDPOINT_NAME -f endpoints/online/managed/sample/blue-deployment.yml
    ```

    > [!Note]
    > Updating by using YAML is declarative. That is, changes in the YAML are reflected in the underlying Azure Resource Manager resources (endpoints and deployments). A declarative approach facilitates [GitOps](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitops): *All* changes to endpoints and deployments (even `instance_count`) go through the YAML.

    > [!TIP]
    > * You can use [generic update parameters](/cli/azure/use-cli-effectively#generic-update-parameters), such as the `--set` parameter, with the CLI `update` command to override attributes in your YAML *or* to set specific attributes without passing them in the YAML file. Using `--set` for single attributes is especially valuable in development and test scenarios. For example, to scale up the `instance_count` value for the first deployment, you could use the `--set instance_count=2` flag. However, because the YAML isn't updated, this technique doesn't facilitate [GitOps](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitops).
    > * Specifying the YAML file is NOT mandatory. For example, if you wanted to test different concurrency setting for a given deployment, you can try something like `az ml online-deployment update -n blue -e my-endpoint --set request_settings.max_concurrent_requests_per_instance=4 environment_variables.WORKER_COUNT=4`. This will keep all existing configuration but update only the specified parameters.

1. Because you modified the `init()` function, which runs when the endpoint is created or updated, the message `Updated successfully` will be in the logs. Retrieve the logs by running:

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="get_logs" :::

The `update` command also works with local deployments. Use the same `az ml online-deployment update` command with the `--local` flag.

# [Python](#tab/python)

If you want to update the code, model, or environment, update the configuration, and then run the `MLClient`'s `online_deployments.begin_create_or_update` method to [create or update a deployment](/python/api/azure-ai-ml/azure.ai.ml.operations.onlinedeploymentoperations#azure-ai-ml-operations-onlinedeploymentoperations-begin-create-or-update).

> [!NOTE]
> If you update instance count (to scale your deployment) along with other model settings (such as code, model, or environment) in a single `begin_create_or_update` method, the scaling operation will be performed first, then the other updates will be applied. It's a good practice to perform these operations separately in a production environment.

To understand how `begin_create_or_update` works:

1. Open the file *online/model-1/onlinescoring/score.py*.
2. Change the last line of the `init()` function: After `logging.info("Init complete")`, add `logging.info("Updated successfully")`. 
3. Save the file.
4. Run the method:

    ```python
    ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(blue_deployment)
    ```

5. Because you modified the `init()` function, which runs when the endpoint is created or updated, the message `Updated successfully` will be in the logs. Retrieve the logs by running:

    ```python
    ml_client.online_deployments.get_logs(
        name="blue", endpoint_name=endpoint_name, lines=50
    )
    ```

The `begin_create_or_update` method also works with local deployments. Use the same method with the `local=True` flag.

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

Currently, the studio allows you to make updates only to the instance count of a deployment. Use the following instructions to scale an individual deployment up or down by adjusting the number of instances:

1. Open the endpoint's **Details** page and find the card for the deployment you want to update.
1. Select the edit icon (pencil icon) next to the deployment's name.
1. Update the instance count associated with the deployment. You can choose between **Default** or **Target Utilization** for "Deployment scale type".
    - If you select **Default**, you cal also specify a numerical value for the **Instance count**.
    - If you select **Target Utilization**, you can specify values to use for parameters when autoscaling the deployment.
1. Select **Update** to finish updating the instance counts for your deployment.


# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

There currently isn't an option to update the deployment using an ARM template.

---

> [!Note]
> The previous update to the deployment is an example of an inplace rolling update.
> * For a managed online endpoint, the deployment is updated to the new configuration with 20% nodes at a time. That is, if the deployment has 10 nodes, 2 nodes at a time will be updated.
> * For a Kubernetes online endpoint, the system will iteratively create a new deployment instance with the new configuration and delete the old one.
> * For production usage, you should consider [blue-green deployment](how-to-safely-rollout-online-endpoints.md), which offers a safer alternative for updating a web service.

### (Optional) Configure autoscaling

Autoscale automatically runs the right amount of resources to handle the load on your application. Managed online endpoints support autoscaling through integration with the Azure monitor autoscale feature. To configure autoscaling, see [How to autoscale online endpoints](how-to-autoscale-endpoints.md).

### (Optional) Monitor SLA by using Azure Monitor

To view metrics and set alerts based on your SLA, complete the steps that are described in [Monitor online endpoints](how-to-monitor-online-endpoints.md).

### (Optional) Integrate with Log Analytics

The `get-logs` command for CLI or the `get_logs` method for SDK provides only the last few hundred lines of logs from an automatically selected instance. However, Log Analytics provides a way to durably store and analyze logs. For more information on using logging, see [Monitor online endpoints](how-to-monitor-online-endpoints.md#logs).

## Delete the endpoint and the deployment

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

If you aren't going use the deployment, you should delete it by running the following code (it deletes the endpoint and all the underlying deployments):

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="delete_endpoint" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

If you aren't going use the deployment, you should delete it by running the following code (it deletes the endpoint and all the underlying deployments):

```python
ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_delete(name=endpoint_name)
```

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

If you aren't going use the endpoint and deployment, you should delete them. By deleting the endpoint, you'll also delete all its underlying deployments.

1. Go to the [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).
1. In the left navigation bar, select the **Endpoints** page.
1. Select an endpoint by checking the circle next to the model name.
1. Select **Delete**.

Alternatively, you can delete a managed online endpoint directly by selecting the **Delete** icon in the [endpoint details page](#view-managed-online-endpoints).

# [ARM template](#tab/arm)

If you aren't going use the deployment, you should delete it by running the following code (it deletes the endpoint and all the underlying deployments):

::: code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/deploy-managed-online-endpoint.sh" ID="delete_endpoint" :::
