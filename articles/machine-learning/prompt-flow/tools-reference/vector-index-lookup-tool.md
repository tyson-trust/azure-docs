# Vector index lookup (preview)

Vector index lookup is a tool tailored for querying within an Azure Machine Learning vector index. It empowers users to extract contextually relevant information from a domain knowledge base.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prompt flow is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Requirements

- embeddingstore --extra-index-url https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/embeddingstore

## Prerequisites

- Follow the instructions from sample flow `Bring your own Data QnA` to prepare a Vector Index as an input.
- Based on where you put your Vector Index, the identity used by the promptflow runtime should be granted with certain roles. Please refer to [Steps to assign an Azure role](../../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps.md):

    | Location | Role |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | workspace datastores or workspace default blob | AzureML Data Scientist |
    | other blobs | Storage Blob Data Reader |

## Inputs

The tool accepts the following inputs:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| path | string | blob/AML asset/datastore URL for the VectorIndex.<br><br>blob URL format:<br>https://`<account_name>`.blob.core.windows.net/`<container_name>`/`<path_and_folder_name>`.<br><br>AML asset URL format:<br>azureml://subscriptions/`<your_subscription>`/resourcegroups/`<your_resource_group>>`/workspaces/`<your_workspace>`/datastores/`<your_datastore>`/paths/`<asset_name and optional version/label>`<br><br>AML datastore URL format:<br>azureml://subscriptions/`<your_subscription>`/resourcegroups/`<your_resource_group>`/workspaces/`<your_workspace>`/data/`<data_path>` | Yes |
| query | string, list[float] | The text to be queried.<br>or<br>The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by the LLM tool. | Yes |
| top_k | integer | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3. | No |

## Outputs

The following is an example for JSON format response returned by the tool, which includes the top-k scored entities. The entity follows a generic schema of vector search result provided by our EmbeddingStore SDK. For the Vector Index Search, the following fields are populated:

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| text | string | Text of the entity |
| score | float | Depends on index type defined in Vector Index. Might be value of distance or similarity |
| metadata | dict | Customized key-value pairs provided by user when creating the index |
| original_entity | dict | Depends on index type defined in Vector Index. The original response json from search REST API|

  
```json
[
  {
    "text": "sample text #1",
    "vector": null,
    "score": 0.0,
    "original_entity": null,
    "metadata": {
      "link": "http://sample_link_1",
      "title": "title1"
    }
  },
  {
    "text": "sample text #2",
    "vector": null,
    "score": 0.07032840698957443,
    "original_entity": null,
    "metadata": {
      "link": "http://sample_link_2",
      "title": "title2"
    }
  },
  {
    "text": "sample text #0",
    "vector": null,
    "score": 0.08912381529808044,
    "original_entity": null,
    "metadata": {
      "link": "http://sample_link_0",
      "title": "title0"
    }
  }
]

```
