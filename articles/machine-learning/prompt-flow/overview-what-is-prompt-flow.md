## LLM-based application development lifecycle

Azure Machine Learning prompt flow offers a well-defined process that facilitates the seamless development of AI applications. By leveraging it, you can effectively progress through the stages of developing, testing, tuning, and deploying flows, ultimately resulting in the creation of fully fledged AI applications.

The lifecycle consists of the following stages:

- Initialization: Identify the business use case, collect sample data, learn to build a basic prompt, and develop a flow that extends its capabilities.
- Experimentation: Run the flow against sample data, evaluate the prompt's performance, and iterate on the flow if necessary. Continuously experiment until satisfied with the results.
- Evaluation & Refinement: Assess the flow's performance by running it against a larger dataset, evaluate the prompt's effectiveness, and refine as needed. Proceed to the next stage if the results meet the desired criteria.
- Production: Optimize the flow for efficiency and effectiveness, deploy it, monitor performance in a production environment, and gather usage data and feedback. Use this information to improve the flow and contribute to earlier stages for further iterations.

By following this structured and methodical approach, Prompt flow empowers you to develop, rigorously test, fine-tune, and deploy flows with confidence, resulting in the creation of robust and sophisticated AI applications.
