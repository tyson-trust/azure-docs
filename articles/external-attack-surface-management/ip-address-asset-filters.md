# IP address asset filters 

These filters specifically apply to IP address assets. Use these filters when searching for a specific subset of IPs.  


## Defined value filters  

The following filters provide a drop-down list of options to select. The available values are predefined. 

|       Filter name          |     Description                                                                                                         |     Value format             |     Applicable operators  |

|     IPv4                   |   Indicates that the host resolves to a 32-bit number notated in four octets (for example, 192.168.92.73).                      |   true / false               |   `Equals` `Not Equals`      |
|     IPv6                   |   Indicates that the host resolves to an IP comprised of 128-bit hexadecimal digits noted in eight four-digit groups.   |   true / false               |                           |
|     Is Mail Server Record  |   Indicates that the host powers a mail server.                                                                         |   true / false               |                           |

|     Port Last Seen         |   Indicates the time frame in which a port was last observed on the host.                                               |   7 days, 14 days, 30 days   |   `Equals` `In`             |


## Free form filters  

The following filters require that the user manually enters the value with which they want to search.  This list is organized by the number of applicable operators for each filter, then alphabetically.
