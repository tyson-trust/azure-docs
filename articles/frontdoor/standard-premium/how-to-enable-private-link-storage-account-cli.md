# Connect Azure Front Door Premium to a Storage Account origin with Private Link with Azure CLI

This article will guide you through how to configure Azure Front Door Premium tier to connect to your Storage Account privately using the Azure Private Link service with Azure CLI.


[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* Have a functioning Azure Front Door Premium profile, an endpoint and an origin group. For more information on how to create an Azure Front Door profile, see [Create a Front Door - CLI](../create-front-door-cli.md).
* Have a functioning Storage Account that is also private. Refer this [doc](../../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md) to learn how to do the same.

> [!NOTE]
> Private endpoints requires your Storage Account to meet certain requirements. For more information, see [Using Private Endpoints for Azure Storage](../../storage/common/storage-private-endpoints.md).

## Enable Private Link to a Storage Account in Azure Front Door Premium
 
Run [az afd origin create](/cli/azure/afd/origin#az-afd-origin-create) to create a new Azure Front Door origin. Enter the following settings to configure the Storage Account you want Azure Front Door Premium to connect with privately. Notice the `private-link-location` must be in one of the [available regions](../private-link.md#region-availability) and the `private-link-sub-resource-type` must be **blob**.

```azurecli-interactive
az afd origin create --enabled-state Enabled \
                     --resource-group myRGFD \
                     --origin-group-name og1 \
                     --origin-name mystorageorigin \
                     --profile-name contosoAFD \
                     --host-name mystorage.blob.core.windows.net \
                     --origin-host-header mystorage.blob.core.windows.net \
                     --http-port 80 \
                     --https-port 443 \
                     --priority 1 \
                     --weight 500 \
                     --enable-private-link true \
                     --private-link-location EastUS \
                     --private-link-request-message 'AFD storage origin Private Link request.' \
                     --private-link-resource /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myRGFD/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorage \
                     --private-link-sub-resource-type blob 
```

## Approve Azure Front Door Premium private endpoint connection from Azure Storage

1. Run [az network private-endpoint-connection list](/cli/azure/network/private-endpoint-connection#az-network-private-endpoint-connection-list) to list the private endpoint connections for your storage account. Make note of the `Resource ID` of the private endpoint connection available in the first line of the output.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network private-endpoint-connection list --name mystorage --resource-group myRGFD --type Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
    ```

1. Run [az network private-endpoint-connection approve](/cli/azure/network/private-endpoint-connection#az-network-private-endpoint-connection-approve) to approve the private endpoint connection

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network private-endpoint-connection approve --id /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myRGFD/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorage/privateEndpointConnections/mystorage.00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    ```

1. Once approved, it will take a few minutes for the connection to fully establish. You can now access your storage account from Azure Front Door Premium. Direct access to the storage account from the public internet gets disabled after private endpoint gets enabled.
