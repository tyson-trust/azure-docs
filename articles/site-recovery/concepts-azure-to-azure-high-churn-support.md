# Azure VM Disaster Recovery - High Churn Support (Public Preview)

Azure Site Recovery supports churn (data change rate) up to 100 MB/s per VM. You will be able to protect your Azure VMs having high churning workloads (like databases) using Azure Site Recovery which earlier could not be protected efficiently because Azure Site Recovery has churn limits up to 54 MB/s per VM. You may be able to achieve better RPO performance for your high churning workloads. 

## Limitations

- Available only for DR of Azure VMs. 
- Recommend VM SKUs with RAM of min 32GB. 
- Source disks must be Managed Disks.

>[!Warning]
> This Public Preview feature has been expanded in [all public regions](../site-recovery/azure-to-azure-support-matrix.md#region-support) where Azure Site Recovery is supported. However, this feature is not available in any Government cloud regions. When using *High Churn* with any other regions outside the supported regions, replication and/or reprotection may fail.

## Data change limits

- These limits are based on our tests and don't cover all possible application I/O combinations. 
- Actual results may vary based on your app I/O mix. 
- There are two limits to consider, per disk data churn and per virtual machine data churn. 
- Limit per virtual machine data churn - 100 MB/s. 

The following table summarizes Site Recovery limits: 

|Target Disk Type|Avg I/O Size|Avg Churn Supported|
|---|---|---|
|Standard or P10 or P15 |8 KB|2 MB/s|
|Standard or P10 or P15|16 KB|4 MB/s|
|Standard or P10 or P15|24 KB|6 MB/s|
|Standard or P10 or P15|32 KB and above|10 MB/s|
|P20|8 KB|10 MB/s|
|P20|16 KB|20 MB/s|
|P20|24 KB and above|30 MB/s|
|P30 and above|8 KB|20 MB/s|
|P30 and above|16 KB|35 MB/s|
|P30 and above|24 KB and above|50 MB/s|

## How to enable High Churn support

### From Recovery Service Vault 

1. Select source VMs on which you want to enable replication. To enable replication, follow the steps [here](./azure-to-azure-how-to-enable-replication.md).

2. Under **Replication Settings** > **Storage**, select **View/edit storage configuration**. The **Customize target settings** page opens.

3. Under **Churn for the VM**, there are two options: 

   - **Normal Churn** (default option) - You can get up to 54 MB/s per VM. Select Normal Churn to use *Standard* storage accounts only for Cache Storage. Hence, Cache storage dropdown will list only *Standard* storage accounts. 

   - **High Churn** - You can get up to 100 MB/s per VM. Select High Churn to use *Premium Block Blob* storage accounts only for Cache Storage. Hence, Cache storage dropdown will list only *Premium Block blob* storage accounts. 
   
        :::image type="Churn" source="media/concepts-azure-to-azure-high-churn-support/churn.png" alt-text="Screenshot of churn.":::

4. Select **High Churn (Public Preview)**.

   If you select multiple source VMs to configure Site Recovery and want to enable High Churn for all these VMs, select **High Churn** at the top level.

5. After you select High Churn for the VM, you will see Premium Block Blob options only available for cache storage account. Select cache storage account and then select **Confirm Selection**.

6. Configure other settings and enable the replication. 

### From Azure VM screen 

1. In the portal, go to **Virtual machines** and select the VM. 

2. On the left pane, under **Operations**, select **Disaster recovery**.
   
   :::image type="Disaster recovery" source="media/concepts-azure-to-azure-high-churn-support/disaster-recovery.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Disaster recovery page.":::

3. Under **Basics**, select the **Target region** and then select **Next: Advanced settings**. 

4. Under **Advanced settings**, select **Subscription**, **VM resource group**, **Virtual network**, **Availability**, and **Proximity placement group** as required.

5. Under **Advanced settings** > **Storage settings**, select **[+] Show details**.

   :::image type="Storage" source="media/concepts-azure-to-azure-high-churn-support/storage-show-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Storage show details.":::

6. Under **Storage settings** > **Churn for the VM**, select **High Churn (Public Preview)**. You will be able to use Premium Block Blob type of storage accounts only for cache storage. 
   
     :::image type="High churn" source="media/concepts-azure-to-azure-high-churn-support/churn-for-vm.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Churn for VM.":::


6. Select **Next: Review + Start replication**.

>[!Note]
>- You can only enable High Churn only when you enable replication while configuring Azure Site Recovery on a VM.
>- If you want to enable High Churn support for VMs already protected by Azure Site Recovery, disable replication for those VMs and select **High Churn** while enabling replication again. Similarly, disable and enable replication again to switch back to **Normal Churn**.

## Cost Implications  

- **High Churn** uses *Premium Block Blob* storage accounts which may have higher cost implications as compared to **Normal Churn** which uses *Standard* storage accounts. For more information, see [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/).
- For High churn VMs, more data changes may get replicated to target for **High churn** compared to **Normal churn**. This may lead to more network cost.
