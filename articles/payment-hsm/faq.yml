      - question: |
          How does Azure Payment HSM work? 
        answer: |
          After HSMs are provisioned, they're connected directly to a user's virtual network, and HSMs are under users' sole administrative control. HSMs can be provisioned as a pair of devices and configured for high availability. The service uses Thales payShield Manager for secure remote access to the HSM.

          - **Description**: PS10-RMGT-KIT2 - payShield Manager Starter Kit - for software V1.4A (1.8.3) and above    
          - **Items Included**: 2 Thales Card Readers, 30 PayShield Manager Smartcards
          Compatible smart cards have a blue band and are labeled "payShield Manager Card". These are the only smart cards compatible with the ciphers used to enable over-network use.
          
      - question: |
          How are physical keys are handled?
        answer: |
          Physical keylocks are decoupled from payShield Manager use and are no longer tied to system state.
          
      - question: |
          Can I still use a console to manage HSM?
        answer: |
          HSMs are managed remotely with payShield Manager. This access does provide a virtual console which can be used for configuration. No access to Local Console is available and availability of local console cannot be controlled.
          
      - question: |
          How do I monitor payShield 10K?
        answer: |
          Payshield 10k can be monitored using standard SNMP V3 tools. payShield Monitor is an additional product available to provide continuous monitoring of HSMs. Contact Thales Sales rep for licensing information.
          
      - question: |
          How do I set up payShield monitor with Azure Payment HSM?

          Paysheild Monitor is distributed as a Virtual Machine and can be deployed on-premises or hosted in an Azure VM instance.
          
      - question: |
          When do I need TMD?
        answer: |
          TMD enables key management for these typical use cases:
          - Forming keys from components 
          - Splitting existing keys into components 
          - Sharing symmetric KEKs internally within an organization or externally with trusted third party
          
      - question: |
          What kind of performance can I expect?
        answer: |
          Performance of a hosted payShield is no different from an on-premises deployment. The actual end-to-end performance of the payment API depends on the location of the workloads and network latencies. When the payment service workloads are run on virtual machines hosted in the same service provider's network, performance should match an on-premises deployment. Network latencies between the computer virtual machine(s) running payment service workloads and the hosted payShield are typically very low, but this would depend on the provider's network setup
          
      - question: |
          How do I decommission an HSM?
        answer: |
          Releasing a device process removes ALL customer data, logs, keys, and so forth.  For steps, see [Tutorial: Remove a commissioned payment HSM](remove-payment-hsm.md).
