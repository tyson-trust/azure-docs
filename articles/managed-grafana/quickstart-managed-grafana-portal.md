# Quickstart: Create an Azure Managed Grafana instance using the Azure portal

Get started by creating an Azure Managed Grafana workspace using the Azure portal. Creating a workspace will generate an Azure Managed Grafana instance.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account for work or school and an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- Minimum required role to create an instance: resource group Contributor.
- Minimum required role to access an instance: resource group Owner.
    >[!NOTE]
    > If you don't meet this requirement, once you've created a new Azure Managed Grafana instance, ask a User Access Administrator, subscription Owner or resource group Owner to grant you a Grafana Admin, Grafana Editor or Grafana Viewer role on the instance.

## Create an Azure Managed Grafana workspace

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.  

1. In the **Search resources, services, and docs (G+/)** box, enter *Azure Managed Grafana* and select **Azure Managed Grafana**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-portal/find-azure-portal-grafana.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure platform. Find Azure Managed Grafana in the marketplace." :::

1. Select **Create**.

1. In the **Basics** pane, enter the following settings.

    | Setting             | Sample value        | Description                                                                                                         |
    |---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Subscription ID     | *my-subscription*   | Select the Azure subscription you want to use.                                                                      |
    | Resource group name | *my-resource-group* | Create a resource group for your Azure Managed Grafana resources.                                         |
    | Location            | *(US) East US*      | Use Location to specify the geographic location in which to host your resource. Choose the location closest to you. |
    | Name                | *my-grafana*        | Enter a unique resource name. It will be used as the domain name in your Managed Grafana instance URL.              |
    | Zone redundancy     | *Disabled*          | Zone redundancy is disabled by default. Zone redundancy automatically provisions and manages a standby replica of the Managed Grafana instance in a different availability zone within one region. There's an [additional charge](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-grafana/#pricing) for this option. |

1. Select **Next : Advanced >** to access API key creation and statics IP address options. **Enable API key creation** and **Deterministic outbound IP** options are set to **Disable** by default. Optionally enable API key creation and enable a static IP address.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-portal/create-form-advanced.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. Create workspace form. Advanced.":::

1. Select **Next : Permission >** to control access rights for your Grafana instance and data sources:
   1. **System assigned managed identity** is set to **On**.

   1. The box **Add role assignment to this identity with 'Monitoring Reader' role on target subscription** is checked by default.

   1. The box **Include myself** under **Grafana administrator role** is checked. This option grants you the Grafana administrator role, and lets you manage access rights. You can give this right to more members by selecting **Add**. If this option grays out for you, ask someone with the Owner role on the subscription to assign you the Grafana Admin role.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-portal/create-form-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. Create workspace form. Permission.":::

1. Optionally select **Next : Tags** and add tags to categorize resources.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-portal/create-form-tags.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal. Create workspace form. Tags.":::

1. Select **Next : Review + create >**. After validation runs, select **Create**. Your Azure Managed Grafana resource is deploying.

## Access your Managed Grafana instance

1. Once the deployment is complete, select **Go to resource** to open your resource.

1. In the **Overview** tab's Essentials section, select the **Endpoint** URL. Single sign-on via Azure Active Directory has been configured for you automatically. If prompted, enter your Azure account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure Managed Grafana doesn't support connecting with personal Microsoft accounts currently.

You can now start interacting with the Grafana application to configure data sources, create dashboards, reports and alerts. Suggested read: [Monitor Azure services and applications using Grafana](../azure-monitor/visualize/grafana-plugin.md).

## Clean up resources

In the preceding steps, you created an Azure Managed Grafana workspace in a new resource group. If you don't expect to need these resources again in the future, delete the resource group.

1. In the **Search resources, services, and docs (G+/)** box in the Azure portal, enter the name of your resource group and select it.
1. In the **Overview** page, make sure that the listed resources are the ones you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete**, type the name of your resource group in the text box, and then select **Delete**.
