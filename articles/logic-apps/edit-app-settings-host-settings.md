# Edit host and app settings for Standard logic apps in single-tenant Azure Logic Apps

[!INCLUDE [logic-apps-sku-standard](../../includes/logic-apps-sku-standard.md)]

In *single-tenant* Azure Logic Apps, the *app settings* for a Standard logic app specify the global configuration options that affect *all the workflows* in that logic app. However, these settings apply *only* when these workflows run in your *local development environment*. Locally running workflows can access these app settings as *local environment variables*, which are used by local development tools for values that can often change between environments. For example, these values can contain connection strings. When you deploy to Azure, app settings are ignored and aren't included with your deployment.

Your logic app also has *host settings*, which specify the runtime configuration settings and values that apply to *all the workflows* in that logic app, for example, default values for throughput, capacity, data size, and so on, *whether they run locally or in Azure*.

<a name="app-settings-parameters-deployment"></a>

## App settings, parameters, and deployment

In *multi-tenant* Azure Logic Apps, deployment depends on Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), which combine and handle resource provisioning for both logic apps and infrastructure. This design poses a challenge when you have to maintain environment variables for logic apps across various dev, test, and production environments. Everything in an ARM template is defined at deployment. If you need to change just a single variable, you have to redeploy everything.

In *single-tenant* Azure Logic Apps, deployment becomes easier because you can separate resource provisioning between apps and infrastructure. You can use *parameters* to abstract values that might change between environments. By defining parameters to use in your workflows, you can first focus on designing your workflows, and then insert your environment-specific variables later. You can call and reference your environment variables at runtime by using app settings and parameters. That way, you don't have to redeploy as often.

App settings integrate with Azure Key Vault. You can [directly reference secure strings](../app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md), such as connection strings and keys. Similar to Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), where you can define environment variables at deployment time, you can define app settings within your [logic app workflow definition](/azure/templates/microsoft.logic/workflows). You can then capture dynamically generated infrastructure values, such as connection endpoints, storage strings, and more. However, app settings have size limitations and can't be referenced from certain areas in Azure Logic Apps.

For more information about setting up your logic apps for deployment, see the following documentation:

- [Create parameters for values that change in workflows between environments for single-tenant Azure Logic Apps](parameterize-workflow-app.md)
- [DevOps deployment overview for single-tenant based logic apps](devops-deployment-single-tenant-azure-logic-apps.md)
- [Set up DevOps deployment for single-tenant based logic apps](set-up-devops-deployment-single-tenant-azure-logic-apps.md)

## Visual Studio Code project structure

<a name="reference-local-settings-json"></a>

## Reference for app settings - local.settings.json

In Visual Studio Code, at your logic app project's root level, the **local.settings.json** file contain global configuration options that affect *all workflows* in that logic app while running in your local development environment. When your workflows run locally, these settings are accessed as local environment variables, and their values can often change between the various environments where you run your workflows. To view and manage these settings, review [Manage app settings - local.settings.json](#manage-app-settings).

App settings in Azure Logic Apps work similarly to app settings in Azure Functions or Azure Web Apps. If you've used these other services before, you might already be familiar with app settings. For more information, review [App settings reference for Azure Functions](../azure-functions/functions-app-settings.md) and [Work with Azure Functions Core Tools - Local settings file](../azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md#local-settings-file).

| `ServiceProviders.Sftp.ServerAliveInterval` | `00:30:00` <br>(30 min) | Send a "keep alive" message to keep the SSH connection active if no data exchange with the server happens during the specified period. For more information, see the [ServerAliveInterval setting](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5#ServerAliveInterval). |
| `ServiceProviders.Sftp.SftpConnectionPoolSize` | `2` connections | Sets the number of connections that each processor can cache. The total number of connections that you can cache is *ProcessorCount* multiplied by the setting value. |
| `ServiceProviders.MaximumAllowedTriggerStateSizeInKB` | `10` KB, which is ~1,000 files | Sets the trigger state entity size in kilobytes, which is proportional to the number of files in the monitored folder and is used to detect files. If the number of files exceeds 1,000, increase this value. |
| `ServiceProviders.Sql.QueryTimeout` | `00:02:00` <br>(2 min) | Sets the request timeout value for SQL service provider operations. |
| `WEBSITE_LOAD_ROOT_CERTIFICATES` | None | Sets the thumbprints for the root certificates to be trusted. |
| `Workflows.Connection.AuthenticationAudience` | None | Sets the audience for authenticating a managed (Azure-hosted) connection. |
| `Workflows.CustomHostName` | None | Sets the host name to use for workflow and input-output URLs, for example, "logic.contoso.com". For information to configure a custom DNS name, see [Map an existing custom DNS name to Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-domain.md) and [Secure a custom DNS name with a TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings.md). |
| `Workflows.<workflowName>.FlowState` | None | Sets the state for <*workflowName*>. |
| `Workflows.<workflowName>.RuntimeConfiguration.RetentionInDays` | None | Sets the amount of time in days to keep the run history for <*workflowName*>. |

### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

To review the app settings for your logic app in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. In your logic app project, at the root project level, find and open the **local.settings.json** file.

1. In the `Values` object, review the app settings for your logic app.

   For more information about these settings, review the [reference guide for available app settings - local.settings.json](#reference-local-settings-json).

To add an app setting, follow these steps:

1. In the **local.settings.json** file, find the `Values` object.

1. In the `Values` object, add the app setting that you want to apply when running locally in Visual Studio Code. Some settings enable you to add a setting for a specific workflow, for example:

   ```json
   {
      "IsEncrypted": false,
      "Values": {
         "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
         "Workflows.WorkflowName1.FlowState" : "Disabled",
         <...>
     }
   }
   ```

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To review your current app settings using the Azure CLI, run the command, `az logicapp config appsettings list`. Make sure that your command includes the `--name -n` and `--resource-group -g` parameters, for example:

```azurecli
az logicapp config appsettings list --name MyLogicApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

For more information about these settings, review the [reference guide for available app settings - local.settings.json](#reference-local-settings-json).

To add or update an app setting using the Azure CLI, run the command `az logicapp config appsettings set`. Make sure that your command includes the `--name n` and `--resource-group -g` parameters. For example, the following command creates a setting with a key named `CUSTOM_LOGIC_APP_SETTING` with a value of `12345`:

```azurecli
az logicapp config appsettings set --name MyLogicApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup --settings CUSTOM_LOGIC_APP_SETTING=12345 
```

<a name="reference-host-json"></a>

## Reference for host settings - host.json

In Visual Studio Code, at your logic app project's root level, the **host.json** metadata file contains the runtime settings and default values that apply to *all workflows* in a logic app resource whether running locally or in Azure. To view and manage these settings, review [Manage host settings - host.json](#manage-host-settings). You can also find related limits information in the [Limits and configuration for Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-limits-and-config.md#definition-limits) documentation.

<a name="job-orchestration"></a>

### Job orchestration throughput

The trigger state persists data across multiple service provider recurrence-based triggers. <br><br>**Important**: Based on your storage size, avoid setting this value too high, which can adversely affect storage and performance. |

<a name="trigger-concurrency"></a>

### Trigger concurrency

The following settings work only for workflows that start with a recurrence-based trigger for [built-in, service provider-based connectors](/azure/logic-apps/connectors/built-in/reference/). For a workflow that starts with a function-based trigger, you might try to [set up batching where supported](logic-apps-batch-process-send-receive-messages.md). However, batching isn't always the correct solution. For example, with Azure Service Bus triggers, a batch might hold onto messages beyond the lock duration. As a result, any action, such as complete or abandon, fails on such messages.

## Manage host settings - host.json

You can add, update, or delete host settings, which specify the runtime configuration settings and values that apply to *all the workflows* in that logic app, such as default values for throughput, capacity, data size, and so on, *whether they run locally or in Azure*. For host settings specific to logic apps, review the [reference guide for available runtime and deployment settings - host.json](#reference-host-json).

<a name="manage-host-settings-portal"></a>

### Azure portal - host.json

To review the host settings for your single-tenant based logic app in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) search box, find and open your logic app.

1. On your logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Advanced Tools**.

1. On the **Advanced Tools** page, select **Go**, which opens the **Kudu** environment for your logic app.

1. On the Kudu toolbar, from the **Debug console** menu, select **CMD**.

1. In the Azure portal, stop your logic app.

   1. On your logic app menu, select **Overview**.

   1. On the **Overview** pane's toolbar, select **Stop**.

1. On your logic app menu, under **Development Tools**, select **Advanced Tools**.

1. On the **Advanced Tools** pane, select **Go**, which opens the Kudu environment for your logic app.

1. On the Kudu toolbar, open the **Debug console** menu, and select **CMD**.

   A console window opens so that you can browse to the **wwwroot** folder using the command prompt. Or, you can browse the directory structure that appears above the console window.

1. Browse along the following path to the **wwwroot** folder: `...\home\site\wwwroot`.

1. Above the console window, in the directory table, next to the **host.json** file, select **Edit**.

1. After the **host.json** file opens, review any host settings that were previously added for your logic app.

   For more information about host settings, review the [reference guide for available host settings - host.json](#reference-host-json).

To add a setting, follow these steps:

1. Before you add or edit settings, stop your logic app in the Azure portal.

   1. On your logic app menu, select **Overview**.
   1. On the **Overview** pane's toolbar, select **Stop**.

1. Return to the **host.json** file. Under the `extensionBundle` object, add the `extensions` object, which includes the `workflow` and `settings` objects, for example:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
         "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "settings": {
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

1. In the `settings` object, add a flat list with the host settings that you want to use for all the workflows in your logic app, whether those workflows run locally or in Azure, for example:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
         "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "settings": {
               "Runtime.Trigger.MaximumWaitingRuns": "100"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

1. When you're done, remember to select **Save**.

1. Now, restart your logic app. Return to your logic app's **Overview** page, and select **Restart**.

### Visual Studio Code - host.json

To review the host settings for your logic app in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. In your logic app project, at the root project level, find and open the **host.json** file.

1. In the `extensions` object, under `workflows` and `settings`, review any host settings that were previously added for your logic app. Otherwise, the `extensions` object won't appear in the file.

   For more information about host settings, review the [reference guide for available host settings - host.json](#reference-host-json).

To add a host setting, follow these steps:

1. In the **host.json** file, under the `extensionBundle` object, add the `extensions` object, which includes the `workflow` and `settings` objects, for example:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
         "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "settings": {
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```

1. In the `settings` object, add a flat list with the host settings that you want to use for all the workflows in your logic app, whether those workflows run locally or in Azure, for example:

   ```json
   {
      "version": "2.0",
      "extensionBundle": {
         "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
         "version": "[1.*, 2.0.0)"
      },
      "extensions": {
         "workflow": {
            "settings": {
               "Runtime.Trigger.MaximumWaitingRuns": "100"
            }
         }
      }
   }
   ```
