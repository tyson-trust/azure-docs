# Use Service Bus Explorer to run data operations on Service Bus
Azure Service Bus allows sender and receiver client applications to decouple their business logic with the use of familiar point-to-point (Queue) and publish-subscribe (Topic-Subscription) semantics. 

> [!NOTE]
> This article highlights the functionality of the Azure Service Bus Explorer that's part of the Azure portal.
>
> The community owned [open source Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer) is a standalone application and is different from this one.

Operations run on an Azure Service Bus namespace are of two kinds 

   * **Management operations** - Create, update, delete of Service Bus namespace, queues, topics, and subscriptions.
   * **Data operations** - Send to and receive messages from queues, topics, and subscriptions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Service Bus Explorer doesn't support **management operations** and **sessions**. 
> - We advice against using the Service Bus Explorer for larger messages, as this may result in timeouts, depending on the message size, network latency between client and Service Bus service etc. Instead, we recommend that you use your own client to work with larger messages, where you can specify your own timeout values.


## Prerequisites

To use the Service Bus Explorer tool, you need to do the following tasks: 

- [Create an Azure Service Bus namespace](service-bus-quickstart-portal.md#create-a-namespace-in-the-azure-portal).
- Create a queue to send and receive message from or a topic with a subscription to test out the functionality. To learn how to create queues, topics, and subscriptions, see the following articles: 
    - [Quickstart - Create queues](service-bus-quickstart-portal.md)
    - [Quickstart - Create topics](service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal.md)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If it's not the namespace you created, ensure that you're a member of one of these roles on the namespace: 
    > - [Service Bus Data Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-service-bus-data-owner) 
    > - [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) 
    > - [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner)

## Use the Service Bus Explorer

To use the Service Bus Explorer, navigate to the Service Bus namespace on which you want to do data operations.

1. If you're looking to run operations against a queue, select **Queues** from the navigation menu. If you're looking to run operations against a topic (and it's related subscriptions), select **Topics**.

## Peek a message

With the peek functionality, you can use the Service Bus Explorer to view the top 100 messages in a queue, subscription or dead-letter queue.

1. To peek messages, select **Peek Mode** in the Service Bus Explorer dropdown.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/peek-mode-selected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dropdown with Peek Mode selected." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/peek-mode-selected.png":::

1. Check the metrics to see if there are **Active Messages** or **Dead-lettered Messages** to peek and select either **Queue / Subscription** or **DeadLetter** subqueue.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-after-send-metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of queue and dead-letter subqueue tabs with message metrics displayed." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-after-send-metrics.png":::

1. Select the **Peek from start** button. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-peek-from-start.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Peek from start button." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-peek-from-start.png":::

1. Once the peek operation completes, up to 100 messages show up on the grid as shown in the following image. To view the details of a particular message, select it from the grid. You can choose to view the body or the message properties.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/peek-message-from-queue.png" alt-text="Screenshot with overview of peeked messages and message body content shown for peeked messages." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/peek-message-from-queue.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Since peek is not a destructive operation the message **won't** be removed from the entity.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For performance reasons, when peeking messages from a queue or subscription which has it's maximum message size set over 1MB, the message body will not be retrieved by default. Instead, you can load the message body for a specific message by clicking on the **Load message body** button. If the message body is over 1MB it will be truncated before being displayed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Since peek is not a destructive operation the message **won't** be removed from the queue.

## Receive a message

The receive function on the Service Bus Explorer permits receiving messages from a queue or subscription.

1. To receive messages, select **Receive Mode** in the Service Bus Explorer dropdown.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-mode-selected.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dropdown with Receive Mode selected." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-mode-selected.png":::

1. Check the metrics to see if there are **Active Messages** or **Dead-lettered Messages** to receive, and select either **Queue / Subscription** or **DeadLetter**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-after-send-metrics-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of queue and dead-letter subqueue tabs with message metrics displayed for receive mode." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-after-send-metrics-2.png":::

1. Select the **Receive messages** button, and specify the receive mode, the number of messages to receive, and the maximum time to wait for a message and select **Receive**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Receive button, and a page where the options can be set." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue.png":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Please note that the ReceiveAndDelete mode is a ***destructive receive***, i.e. the message is removed from the queue when it is displayed on the Service Bus Explorer tool.
    >
    > To browse messages without removing them from the queue, consider using the **Peek** functionality, or using the **PeekLock** receive mode.

1. Once the receive operation completes, the messages show up on the grid as shown in the following image. To view the details of a particular message, select it in the grid. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot with overview of received messages and message body content shown." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-2.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot with overview of received messages and message properties shown." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-3.png":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > For performance reasons, when receiving messages from a queue or subscription which has it's maximum message size set over 1MB, only one message will be received at a time. If the message body is over 1MB it will be truncated before being displayed.

After a message has been received in **PeekLock** mode, there are various actions we can take on it.

> [!NOTE]
> We can only take these actions as long as we have a lock on the message.

### Complete a message

1. In the grid, select the received message(s) we want to complete.
1. Select the **Complete** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Complete button." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-complete.png":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Please note that completing a message is a ***destructive receive***, i.e. the message is removed from the queue when **Complete** has been selected in the Service Bus Explorer tool.

### Defer a message

1. In the grid, select the received message(s) we want to [defer](./message-deferral.md).
1. Select the **Defer** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-defer.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Defer button." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-defer.png":::

### Abandon lock

1. In the grid, select the received message(s) for which we want to abandon the lock.
1. Select the **Abandon lock** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-abandon-lock.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Abandon Lock button." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-abandon-lock.png":::

After the lock has been abandoned, the message will be available for receive operations again.

### Dead-letter

1. In the grid, select the received message(s) we want to [dead-letter](./service-bus-dead-letter-queues.md).
1. Select the **Dead-letter** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-dead-letter.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Dead-letter button." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/receive-message-from-queue-dead-letter.png":::

After a message has been dead-lettered, it will be available from the **Dead-letter** subqueue.

## Send a message to a queue or topic

To send a message to a **queue** or a **topic**, select the **Send messages** button of the Service Bus Explorer.

1. Select the **Content Type** to be either **Text/Plain**, **Application/Xml** or **Application/Json**.
1. For **Message body**, add the message content. Ensure that it matches the **Content Type** set earlier.
1. Set the **Broker properties** (optional) - these include Correlation ID, Message ID, ReplyTo, Label/Subject, Time to Live (TTL) and Scheduled Enqueue Time (for Scheduled Messages).
1. Set the **Custom Properties** (optional) - these can be any user properties set against a dictionary key.
1. Check **Repeat send** to send the same message multiple times. If no Message ID was set, it's automatically populated with sequential values.
1. Once the message has been composed, select the **Send** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/send-experience.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the compose message experience." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/send-experience.png":::

1. When the send operation is completed successfully, one of the following will happen: 

    - If sending to a queue, **Active Messages** metrics counter will increment.
    - If sending to a topic, **Active Messages** metrics counter will increment on the Subscriptions where the message was routed to.  

## Resend a message

After peeking or receiving a message, we can resend it, which will send a copy of the message to the same entity, while allowing us to update it's content and properties. The original will remain and isn't deleted even when resend is from the deadletter queue.

1. In the grid, select the message(s) we want to resend.
1. Select the **Re-send selected messages** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-select-messages-for-resend.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Resend selected messages button." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-select-messages-for-resend.png":::

1. Optionally, select any message for which we want to update its details and make the desired changes.
1. Select the **Send** button to send the messages to the entity.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-resend-selected-messages.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the resend messages experience." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-resend-selected-messages.png":::
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > - The resend operation sends a copy of the original message. It doesn't remove the original message that you resubmit. 
    > - If you resend a message in a dead-letter queue of a subscription, a copy of the message is sent to the topic. Therefore, all subscriptions will receive a copy of the message. 

## Switch authentication type

When working with Service Bus Explorer, it's possible to use either **Access Key** or **Azure Active Directory** authentication.

1. Select the **Settings** button.
1. Choose the desired authentication method, and select the **Save** button.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-select-authentication-type.png" alt-text="Screenshot indicating the Settings button and a page showing the different authentication types." lightbox="./media/service-bus-explorer/queue-select-authentication-type.png":::
