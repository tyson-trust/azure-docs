## Create a namespace in the Azure portal
To begin using Service Bus messaging entities in Azure, you must first create a namespace with a name that is unique across Azure. A namespace provides a scoping container for Service Bus resources within your application.

To create a namespace:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. In the left navigation pane of the portal, select **All services**, select **Integration** from the list of categories, hover the mouse over **Service Bus**, and then select **Create** on the Service Bus tile.

3. In the **Basics** tag of the **Create namespace** page, follow these steps: 
    1. For **Subscription**, choose an Azure subscription in which to create the namespace.
    1. For **Resource group**, choose an existing resource group in which the namespace will live, or create a new one.      
    1. Enter a **name for the namespace**. The namespace name should adhere to the following naming conventions:
        - The name must be unique across Azure. The system immediately checks to see if the name is available. 
        - The name length is at least 6 and at most 50 characters.
        - The name can contain only letters, numbers, hyphens “-“.
        - The name must start with a letter and end with a letter or number.
        - The name doesn't end with “-sb“ or “-mgmt“.
    1. For **Location**, choose the region in which your namespace should be hosted.
    1. For **Pricing tier**, select the pricing tier (Basic, Standard, or Premium) for the namespace. For this quickstart, select **Standard**. 
    
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If you want to use [topics and subscriptions](../service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions.md#topics-and-subscriptions), choose either Standard or Premium. Topics/subscriptions aren't supported in the Basic pricing tier. 

        If you selected the **Premium** pricing tier, specify the number of **messaging units**. The premium tier provides resource isolation at the CPU and memory level so that each workload runs in isolation. This resource container is called a messaging unit. A premium namespace has at least one messaging unit. You can select 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 messaging units for each Service Bus Premium namespace. For more information, see [Service Bus Premium Messaging](../service-bus-premium-messaging.md).
    1. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the page.

    1. On the **Review + create** page, review settings, and select **Create**. 
4. Once the deployment of the resource is successful, select **Go to resource** on the deployment page.

6. You see the home page for your service bus namespace.
