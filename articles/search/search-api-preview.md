# Preview features in Azure Cognitive Search

This article is a complete list of all features that are in public preview. This list is helpful if you're checking feature status.

Preview functionality is provided under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), without a service level agreement, and isn't recommended for production workloads.

Preview features that transition to general availability are removed from this list. If a feature isn't listed here, you can assume it's generally available or retired. For announcements regarding general availability and retirement, see [Service Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search) or [What's New](whats-new.md).

## How to call a preview REST API

Azure Cognitive Search always prereleases experimental features through the REST API first, then through prerelease versions of the .NET SDK.

Preview features are available for testing and experimentation, with the goal of gathering feedback on feature design and implementation. For this reason, preview features can change over time, possibly in ways that break backwards compatibility. This is in contrast to features in a GA version, which are stable and unlikely to change with the exception of small backward-compatible fixes and enhancements. Also, preview features don't always make it into a GA release.

While some preview features might be available in the portal and .NET SDK, the REST API always has preview features.

+ For search operations, [**`2021-04-30-Preview`**](/rest/api/searchservice/index-preview) is the current preview version.

+ For management operations, [**`2021-04-01-Preview`**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/management-api-versions) is the current preview version.

Older previews are still operational but become stale over time. If your code calls `api-version=2019-05-06-Preview` or `api-version=2016-09-01-Preview` or `api-version=2017-11-11-Preview`, those calls are still valid, but those versions won't include new features and bug fixes aren't guaranteed.

The following example syntax illustrates a call to the preview API version.

```HTTP
POST https://[service name].search.windows.net/indexes/hotels-idx/docs/search?api-version=2021-04-30-Preview  
  Content-Type: application/json  
  api-key: [admin key]
```

Azure Cognitive Search service is available in multiple versions and client libraries. For more information, see [API versions](search-api-versions.md).
