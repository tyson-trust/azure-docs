## 2022 announcements

| Month | Item |
|-------|---------|
| November | **Add search to websites** series, updated versions of React and Azure SDK client libraries: <ul><li>[C#](tutorial-csharp-overview.md)</li><li>[Python](tutorial-python-overview.md)</li><li>[JavaScript](tutorial-javascript-overview.md) </li></ul> "Add search to websites" is a tutorial series with sample code available in three languages. If you're integrating client code with a search index, these samples demonstrate an end-to-end approach to integration. |
| November | **Retired** - [Visual Studio Code extension for Azure Cognitive Search](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azurecognitivesearch/blob/master/README.md). |
| November | [Query performance dashboard](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-samples-search-evaluation). This Application Insights sample demonstrates an approach for deep monitoring of query usage and performance of an Azure Cognitive Search index. It includes a JSON template that creates a workbook and dashboard in Application Insights and a Jupyter Notebook that populates the dashboard with simulated data. |
| October | [Compliance risk analysis using Azure Cognitive Search](/azure/architecture/guide/ai/compliance-risk-analysis). Published on Azure Architecture Center, this guide covers the implementation of a compliance risk analysis solution that uses Azure Cognitive Search. |
| October | [Beiersdorf customer story using Azure Cognitive Search](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1552642769228088273-Beiersdorf-consumer-goods-azure-cognitive-search). This customer story showcases semantic search and document summarization to provide researchers with ready access to institutional knowledge. |
| September | [Azure Cognitive Search Lab](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-lab/blob/main/README.md). This C# sample provides the source code for building a web front-end that accesses all of the REST API calls against an index. This tool is used by support engineers to investigate customer support issues. You can try this [demo site](https://azuresearchlab.azurewebsites.net/) before building your own copy. |
| September |  [Event-driven indexing for Cognitive Search](https://github.com/aditmer/Event-Driven-Indexing-For-Cognitive-Search/blob/main/README.md). This C# sample is an Azure Function app that demonstrates event-driven indexing in Azure Cognitive Search. If you've used indexers and skillsets before, you know that indexers can run on demand or on a schedule, but not in response to events. This demo shows you how to set up an indexing pipeline that responds to data update events. |
| August | [Tutorial: Index large data from Apache Spark](search-synapseml-cognitive-services.md). This tutorial explains how to use the SynapseML open-source library to push data from Apache Spark into a search index. It also shows you how to make calls to Azure AI services to get AI enrichment without skillsets and indexers. |
| June | [Semantic search (preview)](semantic-search-overview.md). New support for Storage Optimized tiers (L1, L2). |
| June | **General availability** - [Debug Sessions](cognitive-search-debug-session.md).|
| May | **Retired** - [Power Query connector preview](/previous-versions/azure/search/search-how-to-index-power-query-data-sources).  |
| February | [Index aliases](search-how-to-alias.md). An index alias is a secondary name that can be used to refer to an index for querying, indexing, and other operations. When index names change, for example if you version the index, instead of updating the references to an index name in your application, you can just update the mapping for your alias. |
