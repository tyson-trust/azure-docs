## Doc samples

Code samples from the Cognitive Search team demonstrate features and workflows. Many of these samples are referenced in tutorials, quickstarts, and how-to articles. You can find these samples in [**Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples) on GitHub.

| Samples | Article |
|---------|---------|
| [quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/master/Quickstart/v11) | Source code for the Python portion of [Quickstart: Full text search using the Azure SDKs](search-get-started-text.md). This article covers the basic workflow for creating, loading, and querying a search index using sample data. |
| [search-website-functions-v4](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/main/search-website-functions-v4) | Source code for [Tutorial: Add search to web apps](tutorial-python-overview.md). Demonstrates an end-to-end search app that includes a rich client plus components for hosting the app and handling search requests.|
| [tutorial-ai-enrichment](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-python-samples/tree/master/Tutorial-AI-Enrichment)  | Source code for [Tutorial: Use Python and AI to generate searchable content from Azure blobs](cognitive-search-tutorial-blob-python.md). This article shows how to create a blob indexer with a cognitive skillset, where the skillset creates and transforms raw content to make it searchable or consumable. |

## Demos

A demo repo provides proof-of-concept source code for examples or scenarios shown in demonstrations. Demo solutions aren't designed for adaptation by customers.

| Repository | Description |
|------------|-------------|
