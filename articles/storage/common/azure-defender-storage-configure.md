# Enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage

**Microsoft Defender for Storage** is an Azure-native solution offering an advanced layer of intelligence for threat detection and mitigation in storage accounts, powered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Microsoft Defender Antimalware technologies, and Sensitive Data Discovery. With protection for Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files, and Azure Data Lake Storage services, it provides a comprehensive alert suite, near real-time Malware Scanning (add-on), and sensitive data threat detection (no extra cost), allowing quick detection, triage, and response to potential security threats with contextual information.

With Microsoft Defender for Storage, organizations can customize their protection and enforce consistent security policies by enabling it on subscriptions and storage accounts with granular control and flexibility.

Learn more about Microsoft Defender for Storage [capabilities](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-introduction.md) and [security threats and alerts](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-threats-alerts.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you're currently using Microsoft Defender for Storage classic, consider upgrading to the new plan, which offers several benefits over the classic plan. Learn more about [migrating to the new plan](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-classic-migrate.md).

## Prerequisites for Malware Scanning

### Permissions

To enable and configure Malware Scanning, you must have Owner roles (such as Subscription Owner or Storage Account Owner) or specific roles with the necessary data actions. Learn more about the [required permissions](../../defender-for-cloud/support-matrix-defender-for-storage.md).

### Event Grid resource provider

Event Grid resource provider must be registered to be able to create the Event Grid System Topic used for detect upload triggers.
Follow [these steps](../../event-grid/blob-event-quickstart-portal.md#register-the-event-grid-resource-provider) to verify Event Grid is registered on your subscription.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/register-event-grid-resource-provider.png" alt-text="Diagram showing how to register Event Grid as a resource provider." lightbox="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/register-event-grid-resource-provider.png":::

You must have permission to the `/register/action` operation for the resource provider. This permission is included in the Contributor and Owner roles.

## Set up Microsoft Defender for Storage

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage to ensure maximum protection and cost optimization, the following configuration options are available:

- Enable/disable Microsoft Defender for Storage.
- Enable/disable the Malware Scanning or sensitive data threat detection configurable features.
- Set a monthly cap on the Malware Scanning per storage account to control costs (Default value is 5000GB per storage account per month).
- Configure additional methods for saving malware scanning results and logging.

    > [!TIP]
    > The Malware Scanning features has [advanced configurations](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan.md) to help security teams support different workflows and requirements.

- Override subscription-level settings to configure specific storage accounts with custom configurations that differ from the settings configured at the subscription level.

You can enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage from the Azure portal, built-in Azure policies, programmatically using IaC templates (Bicep and ARM) or directly with REST API.

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent migrating back to the legacy classic plan, make sure to disable the old Defender for Storage policies. Look for and disable policies named **Configure Azure Defender for Storage to be enabled**, **Azure Defender for Storage should be enabled**, or **Configure Microsoft Defender for Storage to be enabled (per-storage account plan)**.

## [Enable on a subscription](#tab/enable-subscription/)

We recommend that you enable Defender for Storage on the subscription level. Doing so ensures all storage accounts in the subscription will be protected, including future ones.

There are several ways to enable Defender for Storage on subscriptions:

- [Azure portal](#azure-portal)
- [Azure built-in policy](#enable-and-configure-at-scale-with-an-azure-built-in-policy)
- IaC templates, including [Bicep](#bicep-template) and [ARM](#arm-template)
- [REST API](#enable-and-configure-with-rest-api)

> [!TIP]
> You can [override or set custom configuration settings](#override-defender-for-storage-subscription-level-settings) for specific storage accounts within protected subscriptions.

### Azure portal

To enable Defender for Storage at the subscription level using the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.
1. Select the subscription for which you want to enable Defender for Storage.

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/defender-for-cloud-select-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to select a subscription in Defender for Cloud." lightbox="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/defender-for-cloud-select-subscription.png":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/enable-azure-defender-security-center.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to enable Defender for Storage in Defender for Cloud." lightbox="media/azure-defender-storage-configure/enable-azure-defender-security-center.png":::

Microsoft Defender for Storage is now enabled for this subscription, and is fully protected, including on-upload malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection.

If you want to turn off the **On-upload malware scanning** or **Sensitive data threat detection**, you can select **Settings** and change the status of the relevant feature to Off.

If you want to change the malware scanning size cap per storage account per month for malware, change the settings in **Edit configuration**.

:::image type="content" source="../../defender-for-cloud/media/azure-defender-storage-configure/defender-for-storage-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to enable Malware Scanning and Sensitive data threat protection.":::

If you want to disable the plan, toggle the status button to **Off** for the Storage plan on the Defender plans page.

### Enable and configure at scale with an Azure built-in policy 

To enable and configure Defender for Storage at scale with an Azure built-in policy to ensure that consistent security policies are applied across all existing and new storage accounts within the subscriptions, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the Policy dashboard.
1. In the Policy dashboard, select **Definitions** from the left-side menu.
1. In the “Security Center” category, search for and then select the **Configure Microsoft Defender for Storage to be enabled**. This policy will enable all Defender for Storage capabilities: Activity Monitoring, Malware Scanning and Sensitive Data Threat Detection. You can also get it here: [List of built-in policy definitions](../../governance/policy/samples/built-in-policies.md#security-center)
    If you want to enable a policy without the configurable features, use **Configure basic Microsoft Defender for Storage to be enabled (Activity Monitoring only)**.
1. Choose the policy and review it.
1. Select **Assign** and edit the policy details. You can fine-tune, edit, and add custom rules to the policy.
1. Once you have completed reviewing, select **Review + create**.
1. Select **Create** to assign the policy.

### Enable and configure with IaC templates

#### Bicep template

To enable and configure Microsoft Defender for Storage at the subscription level using [Bicep](../../azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview.md), make sure your [target scope is set to `subscription`](../../azure-resource-manager/bicep/deploy-to-subscription.md#scope-to-subscription), and add the following to your Bicep template:

```bicep
resource StorageAccounts 'Microsoft.Security/pricings@2023-01-01' = {
  name: 'StorageAccounts'
  properties: {
    pricingTier: 'Standard'
    subPlan: 'DefenderForStorageV2'
    extensions: [
      {
        name: 'OnUploadMalwareScanning'
        isEnabled: 'True'
        additionalExtensionProperties: {
          CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount: '5000'
        }
      }
      {
        name: 'SensitiveDataDiscovery'
        isEnabled: 'True'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To modify the monthly cap for malware scanning per storage account, simply adjust the `CapGBPerMonthPerStorageAccount` parameter to your preferred value. This parameter sets a cap on the maximum data that can be scanned for malware each month per storage account. If you want to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value `-1`. The default limit is set at 5,000 GB.

If you want to turn off the **On-upload malware scanning** or **Sensitive data threat detection** features, you can change the `isEnabled` value to `False` under Sensitive data discovery.

To disable the entire Defender for Storage plan, set the `pricingTier` property value to `Free` and remove the `subPlan` and `extensions` properties.

### Configure Malware Scanning

#### Setting Up Logging for Malware Scanning

For each storage account enabled with Malware Scanning, you can define a Log Analytics workspace destination to store every scan result in a centralized log repository that is easy to query.

:::image type="content" source="../../defender-for-cloud/media/azure-defender-storage-configure/log-analytics-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to configure a Log Analytics destination for scan logs.":::

1. Before sending scan results to Log Analytics, [create a Log Analytics workspace](../../azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace.md) or use an existing one.

1. To configure the Log Analytics destination, navigate to the relevant storage account, open the "Microsoft Defender for Cloud" tab, and select the settings to configure.

This configuration can be performed using REST API as well:

Request URL:

```http
PUT
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}/providers/Microsoft.Security/DefenderForStorageSettings/current/providers/Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/service?api-version=2021-05-01-preview
```

Request Body:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "workspaceId": "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}",
        "logs": [
            {
                "category": "ScanResults",
                "enabled": true,
                "retentionPolicy": {
                    "enabled": true,
                    "days": 180
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Setting Up Event Grid for Malware Scanning

For each storage account enabled with Malware Scanning, you can configure to send every scan result using Event Grid event for automation purposes.

1. To configure Event Grid for sending scan results, you'll first need to create a custom topic in advance. Refer to the Event Grid documentation on creating custom topics for guidance. Ensure that the destination Event Grid custom topic is created in the same region as the storage account from which you want to send scan results.

1. To configure the Event Grid custom topic destination, go to the relevant storage account, open the "Microsoft Defender for Cloud" tab, and select the settings to configure.

> [!NOTE]
> When you set a Event Grid custom topic, you should set “**Override Defender for Storage subscription-level settings**” to “**ON**” to make sure it overrides the subscription-level settings.

:::image type="content" source="../../defender-for-cloud/media/azure-defender-storage-configure/event-grid-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to enable an Event Grid destination for scan logs.":::

This configuration can be performed using REST API as well:

### Override Defender for Storage subscription-level settings

Defender for Storage settings on each storage account is inherited by the subscription-level settings. Use Override Defender for Storage subscription-level settings to configure settings that are different from the settings that are configured on the subscription-level.

The override setting is usually used for the following scenarios:

1. Enable the malware scanning or the data sensitivity threat detection features.

1. Configure custom settings for Malware Scanning.

1. Disable Microsoft Defender for Storage on specific storage accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you enable Defender for Storage on the entire subscription to protect all existing and future storage accounts in it. However, there are some cases where you would want to exclude specific storage accounts from Defender protection. If you've decided to exclude, follow the steps below to use the override setting and then disable the relevant storage account.
> If you are using the Defender for Storage (classic), you can also [exclude storage accounts](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-classic-enable.md).
#### Azure portal

To override Defender for Storage subscription-level settings to configure settings that are different from the settings that are configured on the subscription-level using the Azure portal:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to your storage account that you want to configure custom settings.

1. In the storage account menu, in the **Security + networking** section, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. Select **Settings** in Microsoft Defender for Storage.

1. Set the status of **Override Defender for Storage subscription-level settings** (under Advanced settings) to **On**. This ensures that the settings are saved only for this storage account and will not be overrun by the subscription settings.

1. Configure the settings you want to change:

    1. To enable malware scanning or sensitive data threat detection, set the status to **On**.

    1. To modify the settings of malware scanning:

        1. Switch the "**On-upload malware scanning**" to **On** if it’s not already enabled.

        1. To adjust the monthly threshold for malware scanning in your storage accounts, you can modify the parameter called "Set limit of GB scanned per month" to your desired value. This parameter determines the maximum amount of data that can be scanned for malware each month, specifically for each storage account. If you wish to allow unlimited scanning, you can uncheck this parameter. By default, the limit is set at `5,000` GB.

    Learn more about [malware scanning settings](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-storage-configure-malware-scan.md).

    ```json
    {
        "properties": {
            "isEnabled": true,
            "malwareScanning": {
                "onUpload": {
                    "isEnabled": true,
                    "capGBPerMonth": 5000
                }
            },
            "sensitiveDataDiscovery": {
                "isEnabled": true
            },
            "overrideSubscriptionLevelSettings": true
        }
    }

    1. To modify the settings of malware scanning, edit the relevant fields under “onUpload”, make sure the value of isEnabled is true. If you wish to permit unlimited scanning, assign the value -1 to the capGBPerMonth parameter.
