### Options inherited from parent commands

`--cap-mbps`    (float)    Caps the transfer rate, in megabits per second. Moment-by-moment throughput might vary slightly from the cap. If this option is set to zero, or it is omitted, the throughput isn't capped.

`--output-type`    (string)    Format of the command's output. The choices include: text, json. The default value is 'text'. (default "text")

`--trusted-microsoft-suffixes`    (string)    Specifies additional domain suffixes where Azure Active Directory login tokens may be sent.  The default is '*.core.windows.net;*.core.chinacloudapi.cn;*.core.cloudapi.de;*.core.usgovcloudapi.net;*.storage.azure.net'. Any listed here are added to the default. For security, you should only put Microsoft Azure domains here. Separate multiple entries with semi-colons.
