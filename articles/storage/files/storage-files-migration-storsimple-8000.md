# StorSimple 8100 and 8600 migration to Azure File Sync

The StorSimple 8000 series is represented by either the 8100 or the 8600 physical, on-premises appliances and their cloud service components. StorSimple 8010 and 8020 virtual appliances are also covered in this migration guide. It's possible to migrate the data from either of these appliances to Azure file shares with optional Azure File Sync. Azure File Sync is the default and strategic long-term Azure service that replaces the StorSimple on-premises functionality. This article provides the necessary background knowledge and migration steps for a successful migration to Azure File Sync.

> [!NOTE]
> The StorSimple Service (including the StorSimple Device Manager for 8000 and 1200 series and StorSimple Data Manager) has reached the end of support. The end of support for StorSimple was published in 2019 on the [Microsoft LifeCycle Policy](/lifecycle/products/?terms=storsimple) and [Azure Communications](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/storsimpleeol/) pages. Additional notifications were sent via email and posted on the Azure portal and in the [StorSimple overview](../../storsimple/storsimple-overview.md). Contact [Microsoft Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket/) for additional details.

### Inventory

When you begin planning your migration, first identify all the StorSimple appliances and volumes you need to migrate. After you've done that, you can decide on the best migration path for you.

* StorSimple physical appliances (8000 series) use this migration guide.
* Virtual appliances, [StorSimple 1200 series, use a different migration guide](storage-files-migration-storsimple-1200.md).

### Migration cost summary

Migrations to Azure file shares from StorSimple volumes via migration jobs in a StorSimple Data Manager resource are free of charge. Other costs might be incurred during and after a migration:

* **Network egress:** Your StorSimple files live in a storage account within a specific Azure region. If you provision the Azure file shares you migrate into a storage account that's located in the same Azure region, no egress cost will occur. You can move your files to a storage account in a different region as part of this migration. In that case, egress costs will apply to you.
* **Azure file share transactions:** When files are copied into an Azure file share (as part of a migration or outside of one), transaction costs apply as files and metadata are being written. As a best practice, start your Azure file share on the transaction optimized tier during the migration. Switch to your desired tier after the migration is finished. The following phases will call this out at the appropriate point.
* **Change an Azure file share tier:** Changing the tier of an Azure file share costs transactions. In most cases, it will be more cost efficient to follow the advice from the previous point.
* **Storage cost:** When this migration starts copying files into an Azure file share, storage is consumed and billed. Migrated backups will become [Azure file share snapshots](storage-snapshots-files.md). File share snapshots only consume storage capacity for the differences they contain.
* **StorSimple:** Until you have a chance to deprovision the StorSimple devices and storage accounts, StorSimple cost for storage, backups, and appliances will continue to occur.

### Direct-share-access vs. Azure File Sync

Azure file shares open up a whole new world of opportunities for structuring your file services deployment. An Azure file share is just an SMB share in the cloud that you can set up to have users access directly over the SMB protocol with the familiar Kerberos authentication and existing NTFS permissions (file and folder ACLs) working natively. Learn more about [identity-based access to Azure file shares](storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).

An alternative to direct access is [Azure File Sync](../file-sync/file-sync-planning.md). Azure File Sync is a direct analog for StorSimple's ability to cache frequently used files on-premises.

Azure File Sync is a Microsoft cloud service, based on two main components:

* File synchronization and cloud tiering to create a performance access cache on any Windows Server.
* File shares as native storage in Azure that can be accessed over multiple protocols like SMB and file REST.

Azure file shares retain important file fidelity aspects on stored files like attributes, permissions, and timestamps. With Azure file shares, there's no longer a need for an application or service to interpret the files and folders stored in the cloud. You can access them natively over familiar protocols and clients like Windows File Explorer. Azure file shares allow you to store general-purpose file server data and application data in the cloud. Backup of an Azure file share is a built-in functionality and can be further enhanced by Azure Backup.

This article focuses on the migration steps. If you want to learn more about Azure File Sync before migrating, see the following articles:

* [Azure File Sync overview](../file-sync/file-sync-planning.md "Overview")
* [Azure File Sync deployment guide](../file-sync/file-sync-deployment-guide.md)

### StorSimple service data encryption key

When you first set up your StorSimple appliance, it generated a "service data encryption key" and instructed you to securely store the key. This key is used to encrypt all data in the associated Azure storage account where the StorSimple appliance stores your files.

The "service data encryption key" is necessary for a successful migration. Now is a good time to retrieve this key from your records, one for each of the appliances in your inventory.

If you can't find the keys in your records, you can generate a new key from the appliance. Each appliance has a unique encryption key.

#### Change the service data encryption key

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-generate-key](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-generate-key.md)]

> [!CAUTION]
> When you're deciding how to connect to your StorSimple appliance, consider the following:
>
> * Connecting through an HTTPS session is the most secure and recommended option.
> * Connecting directly to the device serial console is secure, but connecting to the serial console over network switches is not.
> * HTTP session connections are an option but are *not encrypted*. They're not recommended unless they're used within in a closed, trusted network.

### Known limitations

The StorSimple Data Manager and Azure file shares have a few limitations you should consider before you begin your migration, as they can prevent a migration:
* Only NTFS volumes from your StorSimple appliance are supported. ReFS volumes are not supported.
* Any volume placed on [Windows Server Dynamic Disks](/troubleshoot/windows-server/backup-and-storage/best-practices-using-dynamic-disks) is not supported. (deprecated before Windows Server 2012)
* The service doesn't work with volumes that are BitLocker encrypted or have [Data Deduplication](/windows-server/storage/data-deduplication/understand) enabled.
* Corrupted StorSimple backups can't be migrated.
* Special networking options, such as firewalls or private endpoint-only communication can't be enabled on either the source storage account where StorSimple backups are stored, nor on the target storage account that holds your Azure file shares.


### File fidelity

If none of the limitations in [Known limitations](#known-limitations) prevent a migration. There are still limitations on what can be stored in Azure file shares that you need to be aware of.
_File fidelity_ refers to the multitude of attributes, timestamps, and data that compose a file. In a migration, file fidelity is a measure of how well the information on the source (StorSimple volume) can be translated (migrated) to the target (Azure file share).
[Azure Files supports a subset](/rest/api/storageservices/set-file-properties) of the [NTFS file properties](/windows/win32/fileio/file-attribute-constants). ACLs, common metadata, and some timestamps will be migrated. The following items won't prevent a migration but will cause per-item issues during a migration:

* Timestamps: File change time will not be set - it is currently read-only over the REST protocol. Last access timestamp on a file will not be moved, it currently isn't a supported attribute on files stored in an Azure file share.
* [Alternative Data Streams](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-fscc/b134f29a-6278-4f3f-904f-5e58a713d2c5) can't be stored in Azure file shares. Files holding Alternate Data Streams will be copied, but Alternate Data Streams will be stripped from the file in the process.
* Symbolic links, hard links, junctions, and reparse points are skipped during a migration. The migration copy logs will list each skipped item and a reason.
* EFS encrypted files will fail to copy. Copy logs will show the item failed to copy with "Access is denied".
* Corrupt files are skipped. The copy logs may list different errors for each item that is corrupt on the StorSimple disk: "The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error" or "The file or directory is corrupted or unreadable" or "The access control list (ACL) structure is invalid".
* Individual files larger than 4 TiB are skipped.
* File path lengths need to be equal to or fewer than 2048 characters. Files and folders with longer paths will be skipped.
* Reparse points will be skipped. Any Microsoft Data Deduplication / SIS reparse points or those of third parties cannot be resolved by the migration engine and prevent a migration of the affected files and folders.

The [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) at the end of this article has more details for item level and migration job level error codes and where possible, their mitigation options.

### StorSimple volume backups

StorSimple offers differential backups on the volume level. Azure file shares also have this ability, called share snapshots.
Your migration jobs can only move backups, not data from the live volume. So the most recent backup should always be on the list of backups moved in a migration.

Decide if you need to move any older backups during your migration.
Best practice is to keep this list as small as possible, so your migration jobs complete faster.

To identify critical backups that must be migrated, make a checklist of your backup policies. For instance:
* The most recent backup. (Note: The most recent backup should always be part of this list.)
* One backup a month for 12 months.
* One backup a year for three years. 

Later on, when you create your migration jobs, you can use this list to identify the exact StorSimple volume backups that must be migrated to satisfy the requirements on your list.

> [!CAUTION]
> Selecting more than **50** StorSimple volume backups is not supported.
> Your migration jobs can only move backups, never data from the live volume. Therefore the most recent backup is closest to the live data and thus should always be part of the list of backups to be moved in a migration.

> [!CAUTION]
> It's best to suspend all StorSimple backup retention policies before you select a backup for migration. </br>Migrating your backups takes several days or weeks. StorSimple offers backup retention policies that will delete backups. Backups you have selected for this migration may get deleted before they had a chance to be migrated. 

### Map your existing StorSimple volumes to Azure file shares

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-namespace-mapping](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-namespace-mapping.md)]

### Number of storage accounts

Your migration will likely benefit from a deployment of multiple storage accounts that each hold a smaller number of Azure file shares.

If your file shares are highly active (utilized by many users or applications), two Azure file shares might reach the performance limit of your storage account. Because of this, the best practice is to migrate to multiple storage accounts, each with their own individual file shares, and typically no more than two or three shares per storage account.

A best practice is to deploy storage accounts with one file share each. You can pool multiple Azure file shares into the same storage account, if you have archival shares in them.

These considerations apply more to [direct cloud access](#direct-share-access-vs-azure-file-sync) (through an Azure VM or service) than to Azure File Sync. If you plan to exclusively use Azure File Sync on these shares, grouping several into a single Azure storage account is fine. In the future, you may want to lift and shift an app into the cloud that would then directly access a file share, this scenario would benefit from having higher IOPS and throughput. Or you could start using a service in Azure that would also benefit from having higher IOPS and throughput.

If you've made a list of your shares, map each share to the storage account where it will reside.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Decide on an Azure region, and ensure each storage account and Azure File Sync resource matches the region you selected.
> Don't configure network and firewall settings for the storage accounts now. Making these configurations at this point would make a migration impossible. Configure these Azure storage settings after the migration is complete.

### Storage account settings

There are many configurations you can make on a storage account. The following checklist should be used for confirming your storage account configurations. You can change for instance the networking configuration after your migration is complete. 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Large file shares: Enabled - Large file shares improve performance and allow you to store up to 100TiB in a share. This setting applies to target storage accounts with Azure file shares.
> * Firewall and virtual networks: Disabled - do not configure any IP restrictions or limit storage account access to a specific VNET. The public endpoint of the storage account is used during the migration. All IP addresses from Azure VMs must be allowed. It's best to configure any firewall rules on the storage account after the migration. Configure both, your source and target storage accounts this way.
> * Private Endpoints: Supported - You can enable private endpoints but the public endpoint is used for the migration and must remain available. This consideration applies to both, your source and target storage accounts.

### Phase 1 summary

At the end of Phase 1:

* You have a good overview of your StorSimple devices and volumes.
* The Data Manager service is ready to access your StorSimple volumes in the cloud because you've retrieved your "service data encryption key" for each StorSimple device.
* You have a plan for which volumes and backups (if any beyond the most recent) need to be migrated.
* You know how to map your volumes to the appropriate number of Azure file shares and storage accounts.

## Phase 2: Deploy Azure storage and migration resources

This section discusses considerations around deploying the different resource types that are needed in Azure. Some will hold your data post migration, and some are needed solely for the migration. Don't start deploying resources until you've finalized your deployment plan. It's difficult, sometimes impossible, to change certain aspects of your Azure resources after they've been deployed.

### Deploy storage accounts

You'll likely need to deploy several Azure storage accounts. Each one will hold a smaller number of Azure file shares, as per your deployment plan, completed in the previous section of this article. Go to the Azure portal to [deploy your planned storage accounts](../common/storage-account-create.md#create-a-storage-account). Consider adhering to the following basic settings for any new storage account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not configure network and firewall settings for your storage accounts now. Making those configurations at this point would make a migration impossible. Configure these Azure storage settings after the migration is complete.

#### Subscription

You can use the same subscription you used for your StorSimple deployment or a different one. The only limitation is that your subscription must be in the same Azure Active Directory tenant as the StorSimple subscription. Consider moving the StorSimple subscription to the appropriate tenant before you start a migration. You can only move the entire subscription, individual StorSimple resources can't be moved to a different tenant or subscription.

#### Resource group

Resource groups are assisting with organization of resources and admin management permissions. Find out more about [resource groups in Azure](../../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal.md#what-is-a-resource-group).

#### Storage account name

The name of your storage account will become part of a URL and has certain character limitations. In your naming convention, consider that storage account names have to be unique in the world, allow only lowercase letters and numbers, require between 3 to 24 characters, and don't allow special characters like hyphens or underscores. For more information, see [Azure storage resource naming rules](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftstorage).

#### Location

The location or Azure region of a storage account is very important. If you use Azure File Sync, all of your storage accounts must be in the same region as your Storage Sync Service resource. The Azure region you pick should be close or central to your local servers and users. After your resource has been deployed, you can't change its region.

You can pick a different region from where your StorSimple data (storage account) currently resides.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you pick a different region from your current StorSimple storage account location, [egress charges will apply](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/bandwidth) during the migration. Data will leave the StorSimple region and enter your new storage account region. No bandwidth charges apply if you stay within the same Azure region.

#### Performance

You have the option to pick premium storage (SSD) for Azure file shares or standard storage. Standard storage includes [several tiers for a file share](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md#change-the-tier-of-an-azure-file-share). Standard storage is the right option for most customers migrating from StorSimple.

Still not sure?

* Choose premium storage if you need the [performance of a premium Azure file share](understanding-billing.md#provisioned-model).
* Choose standard storage for general-purpose file server workloads, which includes hot data and archive data. Also choose standard storage if the only workload on the share in the cloud will be Azure File Sync.
* For premium file shares, choose *File shares* in the create storage account wizard.

#### Replication

There are several replication settings available. Learn more about the different replication types.

Only choose from either of the following two options:

* *Locally redundant storage (LRS)*.
* *Zone redundant storage (ZRS)*, which isn't available in all Azure regions.

> [!NOTE]
> Only LRS and ZRS redundancy types are compatible with the large 100 TiB capacity Azure file shares.

Geo redundant storage (GRS) in all variations is currently not supported. You can switch your redundancy type later, and switch to GRS when support for it arrives in Azure.

#### Enable 100 TiB capacity file shares

:::row:::
    :::column:::
        :::image type="content" source="media/storage-files-how-to-create-large-file-share/large-file-shares-advanced-enable.png" alt-text="An image showing the Advanced tab in the Azure portal for the creation of a storage account.":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        Under the **Advanced** section of the new storage account wizard in the Azure portal, you can enable **Large file shares** support in this storage account. If this option isn't available to you, you most likely selected the wrong redundancy type. Ensure you only select LRS or ZRS for this option to become available.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

Opting for the large, 100 TiB capacity file shares has several benefits:

* Your performance is greatly increased as compared to the smaller 5 TiB-capacity file shares (for example, 10 times the IOPS).
* Your migration will finish significantly faster.
* You ensure that a file share will have enough capacity to hold all the data you'll migrate into it, including the storage capacity differential backups require.
* Future growth is covered.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not apply special networking to your storage account before or during your migration. The public endpoint must be accessible on source and target storage accounts. No limiting to specific IP ranges or VNETs is supported. You can change the storage account networking configurations after the migration.

### Azure file shares

After your storage accounts are created, go to the **File share** section of the storage account and deploy the appropriate number of Azure file shares as per your migration plan from Phase 1. Consider adhering to the following basic settings for your new file shares in Azure.

:::row:::
    :::column:::

The best practice is to not set a quota here because your migration and other services will fail when the quota is reached.</br></br>**Tiers**</br>Select **Transaction optimized** for your new file share. During the migration, many transactions will occur. It's more cost efficient to change your tier later to the tier best suited to your workload.
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### StorSimple Data Manager

The Azure resource that will hold your migration jobs is called a **StorSimple Data Manager**. Select **New resource**, and search for it. Then select **Create**.

This temporary resource is used for orchestration. You deprovision it after your migration completes. It should be deployed in the same subscription, resource group, and region as your StorSimple storage account.

### Azure File Sync

With Azure File Sync, you can add on-premises caching of the most frequently accessed files. Similar to the caching abilities of StorSimple, the Azure File Sync cloud tiering feature offers local-access latency in combination with improved control over the available cache capacity on the Windows Server instance and multi-site sync. If having an on-premises cache is your goal, then in your local network, prepare a Windows Server VM (physical servers and failover clusters are also supported) with sufficient direct-attached storage capacity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't set up Azure File Sync yet. It's best to set up Azure File Sync after the migration of your share is complete. Deploying Azure File Sync shouldn't start before Phase 4 of a migration.

### Phase 2 summary

At the end of Phase 2, you'll have deployed your storage accounts and all Azure file shares across them. You'll also have a StorSimple Data Manager resource. You'll use the latter in Phase 3 when you configure your migration jobs.

## Phase 3: Create and run a migration job

This section describes how to set up a migration job and carefully map the directories on a StorSimple volume that should be copied into the target Azure file share you select.

### Selecting volume backups to migrate

There are important aspects around choosing backups that need to be migrated:

- Your migration jobs can only move backups, not live volume data. So the most recent backup is closest to the live data and should always be on the list of backups moved in a migration. When you open the Backup selection dialog, it is selected by default.
- Make sure your latest backup is recent to keep the delta to the live share as small as possible. It could be worth manually triggering and completing another volume backup before creating a migration job. A small delta to the live share will improve your migration experience. If this delta can be zero = no more changes to the StorSimple volume happened after the newest backup was taken in your list - then Phase 5: User cut-over will be drastically simplified and sped up.
- Backups must be played back into the Azure file share **from oldest to newest**. An older backup cannot be "sorted into" the list of backups on the Azure file share after a migration job has run. Therefore you must ensure that your list of backups is complete *before* you create a job. 
- This list of backups in a job cannot be modified once the job is created - even if the job never ran.
- In order to select backups, the StorSimple volume you want to migrate must be online.

        > [!CAUTION]
        > You must select **all** backups you wish to migrate. You cannot add older backups later on. You cannot modify the job to change your selection once the job is created.

### Directory mapping

Directory mapping is optional for your migration job. If you leave the section empty, *all* the files and folders on the root of your StorSimple volume will be moved into the root of your target Azure file share. In most cases, storing an entire volume's content in an Azure file share isn't the best approach. It's often better to split a volume's content across multiple file shares in Azure. If you haven't made a plan already, see [Map your StorSimple volume to Azure file shares](#map-your-existing-storsimple-volumes-to-azure-file-shares) first.

As part of your migration plan, you might have decided that the folders on a StorSimple volume need to be split across multiple Azure file shares. If that's the case, you can accomplish that split by:

1. Defining multiple jobs to migrate the folders on one volume. Each will have the same StorSimple volume source but a different Azure file share as the target.
1. Specifying precisely which folders from the StorSimple volume need to be migrated into the specified file share by using the **Directory-mapping** section of the job creation form and following the specific [mapping semantics](#semantic-elements).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The paths and mapping expressions in this form can't be validated when the form is submitted. If mappings are specified incorrectly, a job might either fail completely or produce an undesirable result. In that case, it's usually best to delete the Azure file share, re-create it, and then fix the mapping statements in a new migration job for the share. Running a new job with fixed mapping statements can fix omitted folders and bring them into the existing share. However, only folders that were omitted because of path misspellings can be addressed this way.

#### Semantic elements

A mapping is expressed from left to right: [\source path] \> [\target path].

|Semantic character          | Meaning  |
|:---------------------------|:---------|
| **\\**                     | Root level indicator.       |
| **\>**                     | [Source] and [target-mapping] operator.     |
|**\|** or RETURN (new line) | Separator of two folder-mapping instructions. </br>Alternatively, you can omit this character and select **Enter** to get the next mapping expression on its own line.        |

### Examples
Moves the content of folder *User data* to the root of the target file share:
``` console
\User data > \
```
Moves the entire volume content into a new path on the target file share:
``` console
\ > \Apps\HR tracker
```
Moves the source folder content into a new path on the target file share:
``` console
\HR resumes-Backup > \Backups\HR\resumes
```
Sorts multiple source locations into a new directory structure:
``` console
\HR\Candidate Tracker\v1.0 > \Apps\Candidate tracker
\HR\Candidates\Resumes > \HR\Candidates\New
\Archive\HR\Old Resumes > \HR\Candidates\Archived
```

### Semantic rules

* Always specify folder paths relative to the root level.
* Begin each folder path with a root level indicator "\\".
* Don't include drive letters.
* When specifying multiple paths, source or target paths can't overlap:</br>
   Invalid source path overlap example:</br>
    *\\folder\1 > \\folder*</br>
    *\\folder\\1\\2 > \\folder2*</br>
   Invalid target path overlap example:</br>
   *\\folder > \\*</br>
   *\\folder2 > \\*</br>
* Source folders that don't exist will be ignored.
* Folder structures that don't exist on the target will be created.
* Like Windows, folder names are case insensitive but case preserving.

> [!NOTE]
> Contents of the *\System Volume Information* folder and the *$Recycle.Bin* on your StorSimple volume won't be copied by the migration job.

### Run a migration job

Your migration jobs are listed under *Job definitions* in the Data Manager resource you've deployed to a resource group.
From the list of job definitions, select the job you want to run.

In the job blade that opens, you can see your job's current status and a list of backups you've selected. The list of backups is sorted by oldest to newest and will be migrated to your Azure file share in this order.  

:::row:::
    :::column:::        
        :::image type="content" source="media/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000-job-never-ran-focused.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the migration job blade with a highlight around the command to start the job. It also displays the selected backups scheduled for migration." lightbox="media/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000/storage-files-migration-storsimple-8000-job-never-ran.png":::
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
        Initially, the migration job will have the status: **Never ran**. </br>When you are ready, you can start this migration job. (Select the image for a version with higher resolution.) </br> When a backup was successfully migrated, an automatic Azure file share snapshot will be taken. The original backup date of your StorSimple backup will be placed in the *Comments* section of the Azure file share snapshot. Utilizing this field will allow you to see when the data was originally backed up as compared to the time the file share snapshot was taken.        
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!CAUTION]
> Backups must be processed from oldest to newest. Once a migration job is created, you can't change the list of selected StorSimple volume backups. Don't start the job if the list of Backups is incorrect or incomplete. Delete the job and make a new one with the correct backups selected. For each selected backup, check your retention schedules. Backups may get deleted by one or more of your retention policies before they got a chance to be migrated!

### Per-item errors

The migration jobs have two columns in the list of backups that list any issues that may have occurred during the copy:

* Copy errors </br>This column lists files or folders that should have been copied but weren't. These errors are often recoverable. When a backup lists item issues in this column, review the copy logs. If you need to migrate these files, select **Retry backup**. This option will become available once the backup finished processing. The [Managing a migration job](#manage-a-migration-job) section explains your options in more detail.
* Unsupported files </br>This column lists files or folders that can't be migrated. Azure Storage has limitations in file names, path lengths, and file types that currently or logically can't be stored in an Azure file share. A migration job won't pause for these kinds of errors. Retrying migration of the backup won't change the result. When a backup lists item issues in this column, review the copy logs and take note. If such issues arise in your last backup and you found in the copy log that the failure was due to a file name, path length or other issue you have influence over, you may want to remedy the issue in the live StorSImple volume, take a StorSimple volume backup and create a new migration job with just that backup. You will then migrate this remedied namespace and it will become the most recent / live version of the Azure file share. This is a manual and time consuming process. Review the copy logs carefully and evaluate if it's worth it.

These copy logs are *\*.csv* files listing namespace items succeeded and items that failed to get copied. The errors are further split into the previously discussed categories.
From the log file location, you can find logs for failed files by searching for "failed". The result should be a set of logs for files that failed to copy. Sort these logs by size. There may be extra logs produced at 17 bytes in size. They are empty and can be ignored. With a sort, you can focus on the logs with content.

The same process applies for log files recording successful copies.

### Manage a migration job

Migration jobs have the following states:
* **Never ran** </br>A new job, that has been defined but never ran before.
* **Waiting** </br>A job in this state is waiting for resources to be provisioned in the migration service. It will automatically switch to a different state when ready.
* **Failed** </br>A failed job hit a fatal error that prevents it from processing more backups. A job is not expected to enter this state. A support request is the best course of action.
* **Canceled** / **Canceling**</br>Either and entire migration job or individual backups within the job can be canceled. Canceled backups won't be processed, a canceled migration job will stop processing more backups. Expect that canceling a job will take a long time. This doesn't prevent you from creating a new job. The best course of action is patience to let a job fully arrive in the **Canceled** state. You can either ignore failed / canceled jobs or delete them at a later time. You won't have to delete jobs before you can delete the Data Manager resource at the end of your StorSimple migration.

You can find detailed error information in the blade that opens when you click on the failed backup. </br></br>When you *skip* or *retry* the current backup, the migration service will create a new snapshot in your target Azure file share.

#### Run jobs in parallel

You will likely have multiple StorSimple volumes, each with their own shares that need to be migrated to an Azure file share. It's important that you understand how much you can do in parallel. There are limitations that aren't enforced in the user experience and will either degrade or inhibit a complete migration if jobs are executed at the same time.

There are no limits in defining migration jobs. You can define the same StorSimple source volume, the same Azure file share, across the same or different StorSimple appliances. However, running them has limitations:

* Only one migration job with the same StorSimple source volume can run at the same time.
* Only one migration job with the same target Azure file share can run at the same time.
* Before starting the next job, you ensured that any of the previous jobs are in the `copy stage` and show progress of moving files for at least 30 Minutes.
* You can run up to four migration jobs in parallel per StorSimple device manager, as long as you also abide by the previous rules.

When you attempt to start a migration job, the previous rules are checked. If there are jobs running, you may not be able to start the current job. You'll receive an alert that lists the name of currently running job(s) that must finish before you can start the new job.

> [!TIP]
> It's a good idea to regularly check your migration jobs in the *Job definition* tab of your *Data Manager* resource, to see if any of them have paused and need your input to complete.

### Phase 3 summary

At the end of Phase 3, you'll have run at least one of your migration jobs from StorSimple volumes into Azure file share(s). With your run, you will have migrated your specified backups into Azure file share snapshots. You can now focus on either setting up Azure File Sync for the share (once migration jobs for a share have completed) or direct-share-access for your information workers and apps to the Azure file share.

## Phase 4: Access your Azure file shares

There are two main strategies for accessing your Azure file shares:

* **Azure File Sync**: [Deploy Azure File Sync](#deploy-azure-file-sync) to an on-premises Windows Server instance. Azure File Sync has all the advantages of a local cache, just like StorSimple.
* **Direct-share-access**: [Deploy direct-share-access](#deploy-direct-share-access). Use this strategy if your access scenario for a given Azure file share won't benefit from local caching, or you no longer have an ability to host an on-premises Windows Server instance. Here, your users and apps will continue to access SMB shares over the SMB protocol. These shares are no longer on an on-premises server but directly in the cloud.

You should have already decided which option is best for you in [Phase 1](#phase-1-prepare-for-migration) of this guide.

The remainder of this section focuses on deployment instructions.

### Deploy Azure File Sync

It's time to deploy a part of Azure File Sync.

1. Create the Azure File Sync cloud resource.
1. Deploy the Azure File Sync agent on your on-premises server.
1. Register the server with the cloud resource.

Don't create any sync groups yet. Setting up sync with an Azure file share should only occur after your migration jobs to an Azure file share have completed. If you started using Azure File Sync before your migration completed, it would make your migration unnecessarily difficult since you couldn't easily tell when it was time to initiate a cut-over.

#### Deploy the Azure File Sync cloud resource

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-deploy-afs-sss](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-deploy-azure-file-sync-storage-sync-service.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you want to change the Azure region your data resides in after the migration is finished, deploy the Storage Sync Service in the same region as the target storage accounts for this migration.

#### Deploy an on-premises Windows Server instance

* Create Windows Server 2019 (at a minimum 2012R2) as a virtual machine or physical server. A Windows Server failover cluster is also supported. Don't reuse the server fronting the StorSimple 8100 or 8600.
* Provision or add direct-attached storage. Network-attached storage isn't supported.

It's best practice to give your new Windows Server instance an equal or larger amount of storage than your StorSimple 8100 or 8600 appliance has locally available for caching. You'll use the Windows Server instance the same way you used the StorSimple appliance. If it has the same amount of storage as the appliance, the caching experience should be similar, if not the same. You can add or remove storage from your Windows Server instance at will. This capability enables you to scale your local volume size and the amount of local storage available for caching.

#### Prepare the Windows Server instance for file sync

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-deploy-afs-agent](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-deploy-azure-file-sync-agent.md)]

#### Configure Azure File Sync on the Windows Server instance

Your registered on-premises Windows Server instance must be ready and connected to the internet for this process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Your StorSimple migration of files and folders into the Azure file share must be complete before you proceed. Make sure there are no more changes done to the file share.

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-configure-sync](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-configure-sync.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to turn on cloud tiering. Cloud tiering is the Azure File Sync feature that allows the local server to have less storage capacity than is stored in the cloud, yet have the full namespace available. Locally interesting data is also cached locally for fast, local access performance. Another reason to turn on cloud tiering at this step is that we don't want to sync file content at this stage. Only the namespace should be moving at this time.

### Phase 4 summary

At the end of this phase, you've created and run multiple migration jobs in your StorSimple Data Manager. Those jobs have migrated your files and folders and their backups to Azure file shares. You've also deployed Azure File Sync or prepared your network and storage accounts for direct-share-access.

## Phase 5: User cut-over

This phase is all about wrapping up your migration:

* Plan your downtime.
* Catch up with any changes your users and apps produced on the StorSimple side while the migration jobs in Phase 3 have been running.
* Fail over your users to the new Windows Server instance with Azure File Sync or to the Azure file shares via direct-share-access.

    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

### Plan your downtime

This migration approach requires some downtime for your users and apps. The goal is to keep downtime to a minimum. The following considerations can help:

* Keep your StorSimple volumes available while running your migration jobs.
* When you've finished running your data migration jobs for a share, it's time to remove user access (at least write access) from the StorSimple volumes or shares. A final RoboCopy will catch up your Azure file share. Then you can cut over your users. Where you run RoboCopy depends on whether you chose to use Azure File Sync or direct-share-access. The upcoming section on RoboCopy covers that subject.
* After you've completed the RoboCopy catch-up, you're ready to expose the new location to your users by either the Azure file share directly or an SMB share on a Windows Server instance with Azure File Sync. Often a DFS-N deployment will help accomplish a cut-over quickly and efficiently. It will keep your existing share addresses consistent and repoint to a new location that contains your migrated files and folders.

For archival data, it is a fully viable approach to take downtime on your StorSimple volume (or subfolder), take one more StorSimple volume backup, migrate and then open up the migration destination for access by users and apps. This will spare you the need for a catch-up RoboCopy as described in this section. However, this approach comes at the cost of a prolonged downtime window that might stretch to several days or longer depending on the number of files and backups you need to migrate. This is likely only an option for archival workloads that can do without write access for prolonged periods of time.

### Determine when your namespace has fully synced to your server

When you use Azure File Sync for an Azure file share, it's important that you determine your entire namespace has finished downloading to the server *before* you start any local RoboCopy. The time it takes to download your namespace depends on the number of items in your Azure file share. There are two methods for determining whether your namespace has fully arrived on the server.

#### Azure portal

You can use the Azure portal to see when your namespace has fully arrived.

* Sign in to the Azure portal, and go to your sync group. Check the sync status of your sync group and server endpoint.
* The interesting direction is download. If the server endpoint is newly provisioned, it will show **Initial sync**, which indicates the namespace is still coming down.
After that state changes to anything but **Initial sync**, your namespace will be fully populated on the server. You can now proceed with a local RoboCopy.

#### Windows Server Event Viewer

You can also use the Event Viewer on your Windows Server instance to tell when the namespace has fully arrived.

1. Open the **Event Viewer**, and go to **Applications and Services**.
1. Go to and open **Microsoft\FileSync\Agent\Telemetry**.
1. Look for the most recent **event 9102**, which corresponds to a completed sync session.
1. Select **Details**, and confirm that you're looking at an event where the **SyncDirection** value is **Download**.
1. For the time where your namespace has completed download to the server, there will be a single event with **Scenario**, the value **FullGhostedSync**, and **HResult** = **0**.
1. If you miss that event, you can also look for other **9102 events** with **SyncDirection** = **Download** and **Scenario** = **"RegularSync"**. Finding one of these events also indicates that the namespace has finished downloading and sync progressed to regular sync sessions, whether there's anything to sync or not at this time.

### A final RoboCopy

At this point, there are differences between your on-premises Windows Server instance and the StorSimple 8100 or 8600 appliance.

1. You need to catch up with the changes that users or apps produced on the StorSimple side while the migration was ongoing.
1. For cases where you use Azure File Sync: The StorSimple appliance has a populated cache versus the Windows Server instance with just a namespace with no file content stored locally at this time. The final RoboCopy can help jump-start your local Azure File Sync cache by pulling over locally cached file content as much as is available and can fit on the Azure File Sync server.
1. Some files might have been left behind by the migration job because of invalid characters. If so, copy them to the Azure File Sync-enabled Windows Server instance. Later on, you can adjust them so that they will sync. If you don't use Azure File Sync for a particular share, you're better off renaming the files with invalid characters on the StorSimple volume. Then run the RoboCopy directly against the Azure file share.

> [!WARNING]
> Robocopy in Windows Server 2019 currently experiences an issue that will cause files tiered by Azure File Sync on the target server to be recopied from the source and re-uploaded to Azure when using the /MIR function of robocopy. It is imperative that you use Robocopy on a Windows Server other than 2019. A preferred choice is Windows Server 2016. This note will be updated should the issue be resolved via Windows Update.

> [!WARNING]
> You *must not* start the RoboCopy before the server has the namespace for an Azure file share downloaded fully. For more information, see [Determine when your namespace has fully downloaded to your server](#determine-when-your-namespace-has-fully-synced-to-your-server).

 You only want to copy files that were changed after the migration job last ran and files that haven't moved through these jobs before. You can solve the problem as to why they didn't move later on the server, after the migration is complete. For more information, see [Azure File Sync troubleshooting](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-storage/file-sync-troubleshoot-sync-errors#how-do-i-see-if-there-are-specific-files-or-folders-that-are-not-syncing?toc=/azure/storage/file-sync/toc.json).

RoboCopy has several parameters. The following example showcases a finished command and a list of reasons for choosing these parameters.

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-robocopy](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-robocopy.md)]

When you configure source and target locations of the RoboCopy command, make sure you review the structure of the source and target to ensure they match. If you used the directory-mapping feature of the migration job, your root-directory structure might be different than the structure of your StorSimple volume. If that's the case, you might need multiple RoboCopy jobs, one for each subdirectory. If you unsure if the command will perform as expected, you can use the */L* parameter, which will simulate the command without actually making any changes.

This RoboCopy command uses /MIR, so it won't move files that are the same (tiered files, for instance). But if you get the source and target path wrong, /MIR also purges directory structures on your Windows Server instance or Azure file share that aren't present on the StorSimple source path. They must match exactly for the RoboCopy job to reach its intended goal of updating your migrated content with the latest changes made while the migration is ongoing.

Consult the RoboCopy log file to see if files have been left behind. If issues exist, fix them, and rerun the RoboCopy command. Don't deprovision any StorSimple resources before you fix outstanding issues for files or folders you care about.

If you don't use Azure File Sync to cache the particular Azure file share in question but instead opted for direct-share-access:

1. [Mount your Azure file share](storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md#mount-the-azure-file-share) as a network drive to a local Windows machine.
1. Perform the RoboCopy between your StorSimple and the mounted Azure file share. If files don't copy, fix up their names on the StorSimple side to remove invalid characters. Then retry RoboCopy. The previously listed RoboCopy command can be run multiple times without causing unnecessary recall to StorSimple.

### Troubleshoot and optimize

[!INCLUDE [storage-files-migration-robocopy-optimize](../../../includes/storage-files-migration-robocopy-optimize.md)]

### User cut-over

If you use Azure File Sync, you likely need to create the SMB shares on that Azure File Sync-enabled Windows Server instance that match the shares you had on the StorSimple volumes. You can front-load this step and do it earlier to not lose time here. But you must ensure that before this point, nobody has access to cause changes to the Windows Server instance.

If you have a DFS-N deployment, you can point the DFN-Namespaces to the new server folder locations. If you don't have a DFS-N deployment, and you fronted your 8100 or 8600 appliance locally with a Windows Server instance, you can take that server off the domain. Then domain-join your new Azure File Sync-enabled Windows Server instance. During that process, give the server the same server name and share names as the old server so that cut-over remains transparent for your users, group policy, and scripts.

Learn more about [DFS-N](/windows-server/storage/dfs-namespaces/dfs-overview).

## Phase 6: Deprovision

When you deprovision a resource, you lose access to the configuration of that resource and its data. Deprovisioning can't be undone. Don't proceed until you've confirmed that:

* Your migration is complete.
* There are no dependencies whatsoever on the StorSimple files, folders, or volume backups that you're about to deprovision.

Before you begin, it's a best practice to observe your new Azure File Sync deployment in production for a while. That time gives you the opportunity to fix any problems you might encounter. After you've observed your Azure File Sync deployment for at least a few days, you can begin to deprovision resources in this order:

1. Deprovision your StorSimple Data Manager resource via the Azure portal. All of your DTS jobs will be deleted with it. You won't be able to easily retrieve the copy logs. If they're important for your records, retrieve them before you deprovision.
1. Make sure that your StorSimple physical appliances have been migrated, and then unregister them. If you aren't sure that they've been migrated, don't proceed. If you deprovision these resources while they're still necessary, you won't be able to recover the data or their configuration.<br>Optionally you can first deprovision the StorSimple volume resource, which will clean up the data on the appliance. This process can take several days and won't forensically zero out the data on the appliance. If this is important to you, handle disk zeroing separately from the resource deprovisioning and according to your policies.
1. If there are no more registered devices left in a StorSimple Device Manager, you can proceed to remove that Device Manager resource itself.
1. It's now time to delete the StorSimple storage account in Azure. Again, stop and confirm your migration is complete and that nothing and no one depends on this data before you proceed.
1. Unplug the StorSimple physical appliance from your data center.
1. If you own the StorSimple appliance, you're free to PC Recycle it. If your device is leased, inform the lessor and return the device as appropriate.

Your migration is complete.

## Troubleshooting

When using the StorSimple Data Manager migration service, either an entire migration job or individual files may fail for various reasons. The file fidelity section has more details on supported / unsupported scenarios. The following tables list error codes, error details, and where possible, mitigation options.

### Job level errors

|Phase                                  |Error                                                          |Details / Mitigation  |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
|**Backup**                             |*Could not find a backup for the parameters specified*         |The backup selected for the job run is not found at the time of "Estimation" or "Copy". Ensure that the backup is still present in the StorSimple backup catalog. Sometimes automatic backup retention policies delete backups between selecting them for migration and actually running the migration job for this backup. Consider disabling any backup retention schedules before starting a migration. |
|**Estimation </br> Configure compute** |*Installation of encryption keys failed*                       |Your *Service Data Encryption Key* is incorrect. Review the [encryption key section in this article](#storsimple-service-data-encryption-key) for more details and help retrieving the correct key.        |
|                                       |*Batch error*                                                  |It is possible that starting up all the internal infrastructure required to perform a migration runs into an issue. Multiple other services are involved in this process. These problems generally resolve themselves when you attempt to run the job again.        |
|                                       |*StorSimple Manager encountered an internal error. Wait for a few minutes and then try the operation again. If the issue persists, contact Microsoft Support. (Error code: 1074161829)*         |This generic error has multiple causes, but one possibility encountered is that the StorSimple device manager reached the limit of 50 appliances. Check if the most recently run jobs in the device manager have suddenly started to fail with this error, which would suggest this is the problem. The mitigation for this particular issue is to remove any offline StorSimple 8001 appliances created and used by the Data Manager Service. You can file a support ticket or delete them manually in the portal. Make sure to only delete offline 8001 series appliances. |
|**Estimating Files**                   |*Clone volume job failed*                                      |This error most likely indicates that you specified a backup that was somehow corrupted. The migration service can't mount or read it. You can try out the backup manually or open a support ticket.         |
|                                       |*Cannot proceed as volume is in non-NTFS format*               |Only NTFS volumes, non dedupe enabled, can be used by the migration service. If you have a differently formatted volume, like ReFS or a third-party format, the migration service won't be able to migrate this volume. See the [Known limitations](#known-limitations) section.        |
|                                       |*Contact support. No suitable partition found on the disk*     |The StorSimple disk that is supposed to have the volume specified for migration doesn't appear to have a partition for said volume. That is unusual and can indicate a corruption or management mis-alignment. Your only option to further investigate this issue is to file a support ticket.   |
|                                       |*Timed out*                                                    |The estimation phase failing with a timeout is typically an issue with either the StorSimple appliance, or the source Volume Backup being slow and sometimes even corrupt. If re-running the backup doesn't work, then filing a support ticket is your best course of action.           |
|                                       |*Could not find file &lt;path&gt; </br>Could not find a part of the path*  |The job definition allows you to provide a source sub-path. This error is shown when that path does not exist. For instance: *\Share1 > \Share\Share1* </br> In this example you've specified *\Share1* as a sub-path in the source, mapping to another sub-path in the target. However, the source path does not exist (was misspelled?). Note: Windows is case preserving but not case dependent. Meaning specifying *\Share1* and *\share1* is equivalent. Also: Target paths that don't exist will be automatically created. |
|                                       |*This request is not authorized to perform this operation*     |This error shows when the source StorSimple storage account or the target storage account with the Azure file share has a firewall setting enabled. You must allow traffic over the public endpoint and not restrict it with further firewall rules. Otherwise the Data Transformation Service will be unable to access either storage account, even if you authorized it. Disable any firewall rules and re-run the job. |
|**Copying Files**                      |*The account being accessed does not support HTTP*             |This is an Azure Files bug that is being fixed. The temporary mitigation is to disable internet routing on the target storage account or use the Microsoft routing endpoint.          |
|                                       |*The specified share is full*                                  |If the target is a premium Azure file share, ensure you have provisioned sufficient capacity for the share. Temporary over-provisioning is a common practice. If the target is a standard Azure file share, check that the target share has the "large file share" feature enabled. Standard storage is growing as you use the share. However, if you use a legacy storage account as a target, you might encounter a 5 TiB share limit. You will have to manually enable the ["Large file share"](storage-how-to-create-file-share.md#enable-large-file-shares-on-an-existing-account) feature. Fix the limits on the target and re-run the job.           |

### Item level errors

During the copy phase of a migration job run, individual namespace items (files and folders) can encounter errors. The following table lists the most common errors and suggests mitigation options when possible.

|Phase                                |Error                                                                           |Mitigation           |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|**Copy**                             |*-2146233088 </br>The server is busy.*                                          |Rerun the job if there are too many failures. If there are only very few errors, you can try running the job again, but often a manual copy of the failed items can be faster. Then resume the migration by skipping to processing the next backup. |
|                                     |*-2146233088 </br>Operation could not be completed within the specified time.*  |Rerun the job if there are too many failures. If there are only very few errors, you can try running the job again, but often a manual copy of the failed items can be faster. Then resume the migration by skipping to processing the next backup. |
|                                     |*Upload timed out or copy not started*                                          |Rerun the job if there are too many failures. If there are only very few errors, you can try running the job again, but often a manual copy of the failed items can be faster. Then resume the migration by skipping to processing the next backup. |
|                                     |*-2146233029 </br>The operation was canceled.*                                 |Rerun the job if there are too many failures. If there are only very few errors, you can try running the job again, but often a manual copy of the failed items can be faster. Then resume the migration by skipping to processing the next backup. |
|                                     |*1920 </br>The file cannot be accessed by the system.*                          |This is a common error when the migration engine encounters a reparse point, link, or junction. They are not supported. These types of files can't be copied. Review the [Known limitations](#known-limitations) section and the [File fidelity](#file-fidelity) section in this article. |
|                                     |*-2147024891 </br>Access is denied*                                             |This is an error for files that are encrypted in a way that they can't be accessed on the disk. Files that can be read from disk but simply have encrypted content are not affected and can be copied. Your only option is to copy them manually. You can find such items by mounting the affected volume and running the following command: `get-childitem <path> [-Recurse] -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object {$_.Attributes -ge "Encrypted"} | format-list fullname, attributes`         |
|                                     |*Not a valid Win32 FileTime. Parameter name: fileTime*                          |In this case, the file can be accessed but can't be evaluated for copy because a timestamp the migration engine depends on is either corrupted or was written by an application in an incorrect format. There is not much you can do, because you can't change the timestamp in the backup. If retaining this file is important, perhaps on the latest version (last backup containing this file) you manually copy the file, fix the timestamp, and then move it to the target Azure file share. This option doesn't scale very well but is an option for high-value files where you want to have at least one version retained in your target. |
|                                     |*-2146232798 </br>Safe handle has been closed*                                  |Often a transient error. Rerun the job if there are too many failures. If there are only very few errors, you can try running the job again, but often a manual copy of the failed items can be faster. Then resume the migration by skipping to processing the next backup. |
|                                     |*-2147024413 </br>Fatal device hardware error*                                  |This is a rare error and not actually reported for a physical device, but rather the 8001 series virtualized appliances used by the migration service. The appliance ran into an issue. Files with this error won't stop the migration from proceeding to the next backup. That makes it hard for you to perform a manual copy or retry the backup that contains files with this error. If the files left behind are very important or there is a large number of files, you may need to start the migration of all backups again. Open a support ticket for further investigation.   |
|**Delete </br>(Mirror purging)**     |*The specified directory is not empty.*                                         |This error occurs when the migration mode is set to *mirror* and the process that removes items from the Azure file share ran into an issue that prevented it from deleting items. Deletion happens only in the live share, not from previous snapshots. The deletion is necessary because the affected files are not in the current backup and thus must be removed from the live share before the next snapshot. There are two options: Option 1: mount the target Azure file share and delete the files with this error manually. Option 2: you can ignore these errors and continue processing the next backup with an expectation that the target is not identical to source and has some extra items that weren't in the original StorSimple backup.     |
|                                     |*Bad request*                                                                   |This error indicates that the source file has certain characteristics that could not be copied to the Azure file share. Most notably there could be invisible control characters in a file name or 1 byte of a double byte character in the file name or file path. You can use the copy logs to get path names, copy the files to a temporary location, rename the paths to remove the unsupported characters, and then robocopy again to the Azure file share. You can then resume the migration by skipping to the next backup to be processed. |



## Next steps

* Get more familiar with [Azure File Sync: aka.ms/AFS](../file-sync/file-sync-planning.md).
* Understand the flexibility of [cloud tiering](../file-sync/file-sync-cloud-tiering-overview.md) policies.
* [Enable Azure Backup](../../backup/backup-afs.md#configure-backup-from-the-file-share-pane) on your Azure file shares to schedule snapshots and define backup retention schedules.
* If you see in the Azure portal that some files are permanently not syncing, review the [Troubleshooting guide](/troubleshoot/azure/azure-storage/file-sync-troubleshoot?toc=/azure/storage/file-sync/toc.json) for steps to resolve these issues.
