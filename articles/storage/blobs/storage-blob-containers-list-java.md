# List blob containers with Java

When you list the containers in an Azure Storage account from your code, you can specify several options to manage how results are returned from Azure Storage. This article shows how to list containers using the [Azure Storage client library for Java](/java/api/overview/azure/storage-blob-readme).

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes you already have a project set up to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for Java. To learn about setting up your project, including package installation, adding `import` directives, and creating an authorized client object, see [Get Started with Azure Storage and Java](storage-blob-java-get-started.md).
- The [authorization mechanism](../common/authorize-data-access.md) must have permissions to list blob containers. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for the following REST API operation:
    - [List Containers](/rest/api/storageservices/list-containers2#authorization)

## About container listing options

To list containers in your storage account, call the following method:

- [listBlobContainers](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient)

The overloads for this method provide additional options for managing how containers are returned by the listing operation. These options are described in the following sections.

### Manage how many results are returned

By default, a listing operation returns up to 5000 results at a time. To return a smaller set of results, provide a nonzero value for the size of the page of results to return.

### Filter results with a prefix

To filter the list of containers, specify a string for the `prefix` parameter. The prefix string can include one or more characters. Azure Storage then returns only the containers whose names start with that prefix.

## Example: List containers

The following example list containers and filters the results by a specified prefix:

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/Java/blob-devguide/blob-devguide-containers/src/main/java/com/blobs/devguide/containers/ContainerList.java" id="Snippet_ListContainers":::

You can also return a smaller set of results, by specifying the size of the page of results to return:

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/Java/blob-devguide/blob-devguide-containers/src/main/java/com/blobs/devguide/containers/ContainerList.java" id="Snippet_ListContainersWithPaging":::

## Resources

To learn more about listing containers using the Azure Blob Storage client library for Java, see the following resources.

### REST API operations

The Azure SDK for Java contains libraries that build on top of the Azure REST API, allowing you to interact with REST API operations through familiar Java paradigms. The client library methods for listing containers use the following REST API operation:

- [List Containers](/rest/api/storageservices/list-containers2) (REST API)
