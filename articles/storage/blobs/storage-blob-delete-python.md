# Delete and restore a blob with Python

This article shows how to delete blobs using the [Azure Storage client library for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/storage). If you've enabled [soft delete for blobs](soft-delete-blob-overview.md), you can restore deleted blobs during the retention period.

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes you already have a project set up to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python. To learn about setting up your project, including package installation, adding `import` statements, and creating an authorized client object, see [Get started with Azure Blob Storage and Python](storage-blob-python-get-started.md).
- The [authorization mechanism](../common/authorize-data-access.md) must have permissions to delete a blob, or to restore a soft-deleted blob. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for the following REST API operations:
    - [Delete Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/delete-blob#authorization)
    - [Undelete Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/undelete-blob#authorization)

## Delete a blob

To delete a blob, call the following method:

- [BlobClient.delete_blob](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-delete-blob)

The following example deletes a blob:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_delete_blob":::

If the blob has any associated snapshots, you must delete all of its snapshots to delete the blob. The following example deletes a blob and its snapshots:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_delete_blob_snapshots":::

To delete *only* the snapshots and not the blob itself, you can pass the parameter `delete_snapshots="only"`.

## Restore a deleted blob

Blob soft delete protects an individual blob and its versions, snapshots, and metadata from accidental deletes or overwrites by maintaining the deleted data in the system for a specified period of time. During the retention period, you can restore the blob to its state at deletion. After the retention period has expired, the blob is permanently deleted. For more information about blob soft delete, see [Soft delete for blobs](soft-delete-blob-overview.md).

You can use the Azure Storage client libraries to restore a soft-deleted blob or snapshot.

How you restore a soft-deleted blob depends on whether or not your storage account has blob versioning enabled. For more information on blob versioning, see [Blob versioning](../../storage/blobs/versioning-overview.md). See one of the following sections, depending on your scenario:

- [Blob versioning is not enabled](#restore-soft-deleted-objects-when-versioning-is-disabled)
- [Blob versioning is enabled](#restore-soft-deleted-objects-when-versioning-is-enabled)

#### Restore soft-deleted objects when versioning is disabled

To restore deleted blobs when versioning is disabled, call the following method:

- [BlobClient.undelete_blob](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-undelete-blob)

This method restores the content and metadata of a soft-deleted blob and any associated soft-deleted snapshots. Calling this method for a blob that hasn't been deleted has no effect.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_restore_blob":::

#### Restore soft-deleted objects when versioning is enabled

To restore a soft-deleted blob when versioning is enabled, copy a previous version over the base blob. You can use the following method:

- [start_copy_from_url](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-start-copy-from-url)

The following code example gets the latest version of a deleted blob, and restores the latest version by copying it to the base blob:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_restore_blob_version":::

## Resources

To learn more about how to delete blobs and restore deleted blobs using the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python, see the following resources.

### REST API operations

The Azure SDK for Python contains libraries that build on top of the Azure REST API, allowing you to interact with REST API operations through familiar Python paradigms. The client library methods for deleting blobs and restoring deleted blobs use the following REST API operations:

- [Delete Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/delete-blob) (REST API)
- [Undelete Blob](/rest/api/storageservices/undelete-blob) (REST API)
