# Create a service SAS for a container with Python

[!INCLUDE [storage-auth-sas-intro-include](../../../includes/storage-auth-sas-intro-include.md)]

This article shows how to use the storage account key to create a service SAS for a container with the Blob Storage client library for Python.

## About the service SAS

A service SAS is signed with the storage account access key. A service SAS delegates access to a resource in a single Azure Storage service, such as Blob Storage.

You can also use a stored access policy to define the permissions and duration of the SAS. If the name of an existing stored access policy is provided, that policy is associated with the SAS. To learn more about stored access policies, see [Define a stored access policy](/rest/api/storageservices/define-stored-access-policy). If no stored access policy is provided, the code examples in this article show how to define permissions and duration for the SAS.

## Create a service SAS for a container

You can create a service SAS to delegate limited access to a container resource using the following method:

- [generate_container_sas](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob#azure-storage-blob-generate-blob-sas)

The storage account access key used to sign the SAS is passed to the method as the `account_key` argument. Allowed permissions are passed to the method as the `permission` argument, and are defined in the [ContainerSasPermissions](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containersaspermissions) class.

The following code example shows how to create a service SAS with read permissions for a container resource:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-create-sas.py" id="Snippet_create_service_sas_container":::

## Use a service SAS to authorize a client object

The following code example shows how to use the service SAS created in the earlier example to authorize a [ContainerClient](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.containerclient) object. This client object can be used to perform operations on the container resource based on the permissions granted by the SAS.
