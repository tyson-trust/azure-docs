# Manage blob properties and metadata with Python

In addition to the data they contain, blobs support system properties and user-defined metadata. This article shows how to manage system properties and user-defined metadata using the [Azure Storage client library for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/storage).

## Prerequisites

- This article assumes you already have a project set up to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python. To learn about setting up your project, including package installation, adding `import` statements, and creating an authorized client object, see [Get started with Azure Blob Storage and Python](storage-blob-python-get-started.md).
- The [authorization mechanism](../common/authorize-data-access.md) must have permissions to work with blob properties or metadata. To learn more, see the authorization guidance for the following REST API operations:
    - [Set Blob Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-properties#authorization)
    - [Get Blob Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-properties#authorization)
    - [Set Blob Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-metadata#authorization)
    - [Get Blob Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-metadata#authorization)

## About properties and metadata

- **System properties**: System properties exist on each Blob storage resource. Some of them can be read or set, while others are read-only. Under the covers, some system properties correspond to certain standard HTTP headers. The Azure Storage client library for Python maintains these properties for you.

- **User-defined metadata**: User-defined metadata consists of one or more name-value pairs that you specify for a Blob storage resource. You can use metadata to store additional values with the resource. Metadata values are for your own purposes only, and don't affect how the resource behaves.

    Metadata name/value pairs are valid HTTP headers and should adhere to all restrictions governing HTTP headers. For more information about metadata naming requirements, see [Metadata names](/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata#metadata-names).

> [!NOTE]
> Blob index tags also provide the ability to store arbitrary user-defined key/value attributes alongside an Azure Blob storage resource. While similar to metadata, only blob index tags are automatically indexed and made searchable by the native blob service. Metadata cannot be indexed and queried unless you utilize a separate service such as Azure Search.

## Set and retrieve properties

To set properties on a blob, use the following method:

- [BlobClient.set_http_headers](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-set-http-headers)

Any properties not explicitly set are cleared. To preserve any existing properties, you can first retrieve the blob properties, then use them to populate the headers that aren't being updated.

The following code example sets the `content_type` and `content_language` system properties on a blob, while preserving the existing properties:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_set_blob_properties":::

To retrieve properties on a blob, use the following method:

- [BlobClient.get_blob_properties](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-get-blob-properties)

The following code example gets a blob's system properties and displays some of the values:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_get_blob_properties":::

## Set and retrieve metadata

You can specify metadata as one or more name-value pairs on a blob or container resource. To set metadata, send a [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict) containing name-value pairs using the following method:

- [BlobClient.set_blob_metadata](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-set-blob-metadata)

The following code example sets metadata on a blob:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_set_blob_metadata":::

To retrieve metadata, call the [get_blob_properties](/python/api/azure-storage-blob/azure.storage.blob.blobclient#azure-storage-blob-blobclient-get-blob-properties) method on your blob to populate the metadata collection, then read the values, as shown in the example below. The `get_blob_properties` method retrieves blob properties and metadata by calling both the [Get Blob Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-properties) operation and the [Get Blob Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-metadata) operation.

The following code example reads metadata on a blob and prints each key/value pair: 

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/python/blob-devguide-py/blob-devguide-blobs.py" id="Snippet_get_blob_metadata":::

## Resources

To learn more about how to manage system properties and user-defined metadata using the Azure Blob Storage client library for Python, see the following resources.

### REST API operations

The Azure SDK for Python contains libraries that build on top of the Azure REST API, allowing you to interact with REST API operations through familiar Python paradigms. The client library methods for managing system properties and user-defined metadata use the following REST API operations:

- [Set Blob Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-properties) (REST API)
- [Get Blob Properties](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-properties) (REST API)
- [Set Blob Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-metadata) (REST API)
- [Get Blob Metadata](/rest/api/storageservices/get-blob-metadata) (REST API)
