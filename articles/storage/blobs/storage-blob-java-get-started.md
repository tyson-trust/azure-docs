# Get started with Azure Blob Storage and Java

This article shows you how to connect to Azure Blob Storage by using the Azure Blob Storage client library for Java. Once connected, your code can operate on containers, blobs, and features of the Blob Storage service.

[API reference](/java/api/overview/azure/storage-blob-readme) | [Package (Maven)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-storage-blob) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob) | [Samples](../common/storage-samples-java.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#blob-samples) | [Give feedback](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues)

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- Azure storage account - [create a storage account](../common/storage-account-create.md)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/) version 8 or above
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is used for project management in this example

## Set up your project

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses the Maven build tool to build and run the sample code. Other build tools, such as Gradle, also work with the Azure SDK for Java.

Use Maven to create a new console app, or open an existing project. Follow these steps to install packages and add the necessary `import` directives.

### Install packages

Open the `pom.xml` file in your text editor. Install the packages by [including the BOM file](#include-the-bom-file), or [including a direct dependency](#include-a-direct-dependency).

#### Include the BOM file
 
Add **azure-sdk-bom** to take a dependency on the latest version of the library. In the following snippet, replace the `{bom_version_to_target}` placeholder with the version number. Using **azure-sdk-bom** keeps you from having to specify the version of each individual dependency. To learn more about the BOM, see the [Azure SDK BOM README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/boms/azure-sdk-bom/README.md).

```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
            <artifactId>azure-sdk-bom</artifactId>
            <version>{bom_version_to_target}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

Add the following dependency elements to the group of dependencies. The **azure-identity** dependency is needed for passwordless connections to Azure services.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-storage-blob</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
      <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
      <artifactId>azure-storage-common</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-identity</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Include a direct dependency

To take dependency on a particular version of the library, add the direct dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-storage-blob</artifactId>
    <version>{package_version_to_target}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
      <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
      <artifactId>azure-storage-common</artifactId>
      <version>{package_version_to_target}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.azure</groupId>
    <artifactId>azure-identity</artifactId>
    <version>{package_version_to_target}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Include import directives

Then open your code file and add the necessary `import` directives. In this example, we add the following directives in the *App.java* file:

```java
import com.azure.core.credential.*;
import com.azure.identity.*;
import com.azure.storage.blob.*;
import com.azure.storage.blob.models.*;
import com.azure.storage.blob.specialized.*;
import com.azure.storage.common.*;
```

Blob client library information:

- [com.azure.storage.blob](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob): Contains the primary classes (_client objects_) that you can use to operate on the service, containers, and blobs.
- [com.azure.storage.blob.models](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.models): Contains utility classes, structures, and enumeration types.
- [com.azure.storage.blob.specialized](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.specialized): Contains classes that you can use to perform operations specific to a blob type (For example: append blobs).

## Authorize access and connect to Blob Storage

To connect an application to Blob Storage, create an instance of the [BlobServiceClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) class. This object is your starting point to interact with data resources at the storage account level. You can use it to operate on the storage account and its containers. You can also use the service client to create container clients or blob clients, depending on the resource you need to work with.

To learn more about creating and managing client objects, see [Create and manage client objects that interact with data resources](storage-blob-client-management.md).

You can authorize a `BlobServiceClient` object by using an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authorization token, an account access key, or a shared access signature (SAS).

## [Azure AD (Recommended)](#tab/azure-ad)

To authorize with Azure AD, you'll need to use a [security principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). Which type of security principal you need depends on where your application runs. Use the following table as a guide:

| Where the application runs | Security principal | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local machine (developing and testing) | Service principal | To learn how to register the app, set up an Azure AD group, assign roles, and configure environment variables, see [Authorize access using developer service principals](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication-local-development-service-principal?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json). | 
| Local machine (developing and testing) | User identity | To learn how to set up an Azure AD group, assign roles, and sign in to Azure, see [Authorize access using developer credentials](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication-local-development-dev-accounts?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json). | 
| Hosted in Azure | Managed identity | To learn how to enable managed identity and assign roles, see [Authorize access from Azure-hosted apps using a managed identity](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication-azure-hosted-apps?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json). |
| Hosted outside of Azure (for example, on-premises apps) | Service principal | To learn how to register the app, assign roles, and configure environment variables, see [Authorize access from on-premises apps using an application service principal](/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication-on-premises-apps?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json&bc=/azure/storage/blobs/breadcrumb/toc.json) |

#### Authorize access using DefaultAzureCredential

An easy and secure way to authorize access and connect to Blob Storage is to obtain an OAuth token by creating a [DefaultAzureCredential](/java/api/com.azure.identity.defaultazurecredential) instance. You can then use that credential to create a [BlobServiceClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object.

Make sure you have the correct dependencies in pom.xml and the necessary import directives, as described in [Set up your project](#set-up-your-project).

The following example uses [BlobServiceClientBuilder](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclientbuilder) to build a `BlobServiceClient` object using `DefaultAzureCredential`:

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/Java/blob-devguide/blob-devguide-blobs/src/main/java/com/blobs/devguide/blobs/App.java" id="Snippet_GetServiceClientAzureAD":::

## [SAS token](#tab/sas-token)

Use [BlobServiceClientBuilder](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclientbuilder) to build a [BlobServiceClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object using a SAS token:

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/Java/blob-devguide/blob-devguide-blobs/src/main/java/com/blobs/devguide/blobs/App.java" id="Snippet_GetServiceClientSAS":::

To learn more about generating and managing SAS tokens, see the following articles:

- [Grant limited access to Azure Storage resources using shared access signatures (SAS)](../common/storage-sas-overview.md?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json)
- [Create an account SAS with Java](../common/storage-account-sas-create-java.md)
- [Create a service SAS for a container with Java](sas-service-create-java-container.md)
- [Create a service SAS for a blob with Java](sas-service-create-java.md)
- [Create a user delegation SAS for a container with Java](storage-blob-container-user-delegation-sas-create-java.md)
- [Create a user delegation SAS for a blob with Java](storage-blob-user-delegation-sas-create-java.md)

## [Account key](#tab/account-key)

Create a [StorageSharedKeyCredential](/java/api/com.azure.storage.common.storagesharedkeycredential) by using the storage account name and account key. Then use that object to initialize a [BlobServiceClient](/java/api/com.azure.storage.blob.blobserviceclient) object.

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/Java/blob-devguide/blob-devguide-blobs/src/main/java/com/blobs/devguide/blobs/App.java" id="Snippet_GetServiceClientAccountKey":::

You can also create a `BlobServiceClient` object using a connection string.

:::code language="java" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/blobs/howto/Java/blob-devguide/blob-devguide-blobs/src/main/java/com/blobs/devguide/blobs/App.java" id="Snippet_GetServiceClientConnectionString":::

For information about how to obtain account keys and best practice guidelines for properly managing and safeguarding your keys, see [Manage storage account access keys](../common/storage-account-keys-manage.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The account access key should be used with caution. If your account access key is lost or accidentally placed in an insecure location, your service may become vulnerable. Anyone who has the access key is able to authorize requests against the storage account, and effectively has access to all the data. `DefaultAzureCredential` provides enhanced security features and benefits and is the recommended approach for managing authorization to Azure services.
