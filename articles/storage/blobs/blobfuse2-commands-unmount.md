# How to use the BlobFuse2 unmount command

Use the `blobfuse2 unmount` command to unmount one or more existing BlobFuse2 mount points.

## Syntax

The `blobfuse2 unmount` command has 2 formats:

`blobfuse2 unmount [mount path] [flags]`

`blobfuse2 unmount all [flags]`

## Arguments

`[mount path]`

Specify a file path to the directory that contains the mount point to be unmounted. Example:

```bash
blobfuse2 unmount ./mount_path ...
```

`all`

Unmount all existing BlobFuse2 mount points.

## Flags (options)

The following flags were inherited from the parent (the BlobFuse2 command):

| Flag | Short version | Value type | Default value | Example | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| disable-version-check |    | boolean | false | --disable-version-check=true | Enables or disables automatic version checking of the BlobFuse2 binaries |
| help                  | -h | n/a     |       | -h or --help                 | Help info for the blobfuse2 command and subcommands                      |

There are no flags only supported by the unmount command.

## Examples

1. Unmount a BlobFuse2 mount instance:

    ```bash
    sudo blobfuse2 unmount ./mount_path
    ```

    (Alternatively, you can use a native Linux command to do the same):

    ```bash
    sudo fusermount3 -u ./mount_path
    ```

1. Unmount all BlobFuse2 mount points (see also [The BlobFuse2 unmount all command](blobfuse2-commands-unmount-all.md)):

    ```bash
    sudo blobfuse2 unmount all
    ```
