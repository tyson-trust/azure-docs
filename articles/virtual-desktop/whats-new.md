## July 2023

Here's what changed in July 2023:

### Autoscale for personal host pools is currently in preview

Autoscale for personal host pools is now in preview. Autoscale lets you scale your session host virtual machines (VMs) in a host pool up or down according to a schedule to optimize deployment costs.

To learn more about autoscale for personal host pools, see [Autoscale scaling plans and example scenarios in Azure Virtual Desktop](autoscale-scenarios.md).

### Confidential VMs are now generally available in Azure Virtual Desktop

Confidential VM and Trusted Launch security features for Azure Virtual Desktop host pool provisioning are now generally available.

Azure confidential virtual machines (VMs) offer VM memory encryption with integrity protection, which strengthens guest protections to deny the hypervisor and other host management components code access to the VM memory and state. For more information about the security benefits of confidential VMs, see our [confidential computing documentation](../confidential-computing/confidential-vm-overview.md).  

Trusted Launch protects against advanced and persistent attack techniques. This feature allows you to securely deploy your VMs with verified boot loaders, OS kernels, and drivers. Trusted Launch also protects keys, certificates, and secrets in VMs. For more information about the benefits of Trusted Launch, see our [Trusted Launch documentation](../virtual-machines/trusted-launch.md). Trusted Launch is now enabled by default for all Windows images used with Azure Virtual Desktop.

For more information about this announcement, see [Announcing General Availability of confidential VMs in Azure Virtual Desktop](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop-blog/announcing-general-availability-of-confidential-vms-in-azure/ba-p/3857974). 

### Private Link with Azure Virtual Desktop is now generally available

Private Link with Azure Virtual Desktop allows users to establish secure connections to remote resources using private endpoints. With Private Link, traffic between your virtual network and the Azure Virtual Desktop service is routed through the Microsoft *backbone* network. This routing eliminates the need to expose your service to the public internet, enhancing the overall security of your infrastructure. By keeping traffic within this protected network, Private Link adds an extra layer of security for your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. For more information about Private Link, see [Azure Private Link with Azure Virtual Desktop](private-link-overview.md) or read [our blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop-blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-private-link-for-azure/ba-p/3874429).

To learn more about new features, check out [this blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-virtual-desktop-spring-update-enters-public-preview/ba-p/1340245). 

### Autoscaling tool update

The latest version of the autoscaling tool that was in preview is now generally available. This tool uses an Azure Automation account and the Azure Logic App to automatically shut down and restart session host VMs within a host pool, reducing infrastructure costs. Learn more at [Scale session hosts using Azure Automation](set-up-scaling-script.md).

### Azure portal

You can now do the following things with the Azure portal in Azure Virtual Desktop: 

- Directly assign users to personal desktop session hosts  
- Change the validation environment setting for host pools 

### Diagnostics

We've released some new prebuilt queries for the Log Analytics workspace. To access the queries, go to **Logs** and under **Category**, select **Azure Virtual Desktop**. Learn more at [Use Log Analytics for the diagnostics feature](diagnostics-log-analytics.md).

### Update for Remote Desktop client for Android

### Teams update

We've made improvements to Microsoft Teams for Azure Virtual Desktop. Most importantly, Azure Virtual Desktop now supports audio and video optimization for the Windows Desktop client. Redirection improves latency by creating direct paths between users when they use audio or video in calls and meetings. Less distance means fewer hops, which makes calls look and sound smoother. Learn more at [Use Teams on Azure Virtual Desktop](./teams-on-avd.md).

## June 2020

Last month, we introduced Azure Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager integration in preview. This update has lots of exciting new features we'd love to tell you about. Here's what's new for this version of Azure Virtual Desktop.

### Azure Virtual Desktop is now integrated with Azure Resource Manager

Azure Virtual Desktop is now integrated into Azure Resource Manager. In the latest update, all Azure Virtual Desktop objects are now Azure Resource Manager resources. This update is also integrated with Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). See [What is Azure Resource Manager?](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) to learn more.

Here's what this change does for you:

- Azure Virtual Desktop is now integrated with the Azure portal. This means you can manage everything directly in the portal, no PowerShell, web apps, or third-party tools required. To get started, check out our tutorial at [Create a host pool with the Azure portal](create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md).

- Before this update, you could only publish desktops and applications to individual users. With Azure Resource Manager, you can now publish resources to Azure Active Directory groups.

- The earlier version of Azure Virtual Desktop had four built-in admin roles that you could assign to a tenant or host pool. These roles are now in [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../role-based-access-control/overview.md). You can apply these roles to every Azure Virtual Desktop Azure Resource Manager object, which lets you have a full, rich delegation model.

- In this update, you no longer need to run Azure Marketplace or the GitHub template repeatedly to expand a host pool. All you need to expand a host pool is to go to your host pool in the Azure portal and select **+ Add** to deploy additional session hosts.

- Host pool deployment is now fully integrated with the [Azure Shared Image Gallery](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md). Shared Image Gallery is a separate Azure service that stores VM image definitions, including image versioning. You can also use global replication to copy and send your images to other Azure regions for local deployment.

- Monitoring functions that used to be done through PowerShell or the Diagnostics Service web app have now moved to Log Analytics in the Azure portal. You also now have two options to visualize your reports. You can run Kusto queries and use Workbooks to create visual reports.

- You're no longer required to complete Azure Active Directory consent to use Azure Virtual Desktop. In this update, the Azure Active Directory tenant on your Azure subscription authenticates your users and provides Azure RBAC controls for your admins.

### PowerShell support

We've added new AzWvd cmdlets to the Azure Az PowerShell module with this update. This new module is supported in PowerShell Core, which runs on .NET Core.

To install the module, follow the instructions in [Set up the PowerShell module for Azure Virtual Desktop](powershell-module.md).

You can also see a list of available commands at the [AzWvd PowerShell reference](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization/#desktopvirtualization).

For more information about the new features, check out [our blog post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/windows-virtual-desktop-spring-update-enters-public-preview/ba-p/1340245).

### Additional gateways

We've added a new gateway cluster in South Africa to reduce connection latency.

### Microsoft Teams on Azure Virtual Desktop (Preview)

We've made some improvements to Microsoft Teams for Azure Virtual Desktop. Most importantly, Azure Virtual Desktop now supports audio and visual redirection for calls. Redirection improves latency by creating direct paths between users when they call using audio or video. Less distance means fewer hops, which makes calls look and sound smoother.

To learn more, see [our blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/windows-virtual-desktop-media-optimization-for-microsoft-teams-is-now-available-in-public-preview/).
