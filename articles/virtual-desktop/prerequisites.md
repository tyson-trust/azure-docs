# Prerequisites for Azure Virtual Desktop

There are a few things you need to start using Azure Virtual Desktop. Here you can find what prerequisites you need to complete to successfully provide your users with desktops and applications.

At a high level, you'll need:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - An Azure account with an active subscription
> - A supported identity provider
> - A supported operating system for session host virtual machines
> - Appropriate licenses
> - Network connectivity
> - A Remote Desktop client

## Azure account with an active subscription

You'll need an Azure account with an active subscription to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop. If you don't have one already, you can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). Your account must be assigned the [contributor or owner role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) on your subscription.

You also need to make sure you've registered the *Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization* resource provider for your subscription. To check the status of the resource provider and register if needed, select the relevant tab for your scenario and follow the steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must have permission to register a resource provider, which requires the `*/register/action` operation. This is included if your account is assigned the [contributor or owner role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) on your subscription.

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Subscriptions**.

1. Select the name of your subscription.

1. Select **Resource providers**.

1. Search for **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization**.

1. If the status is *NotRegistered*, select **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization**, and then select **Register**.

1. Verify that the status of Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization is *Registered*.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

[!INCLUDE [include-cloud-shell-local-cli](includes/include-cloud-shell-local-cli.md)]

2. Register the **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization** resource provider by running the following command. You can run this even if the resource provider is already registered.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization
   ```

3. Verify that the parameter **RegistrationState** is set to *Registered* by running the following command:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az provider show \
       --namespace Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization \
       --query {RegistrationState:registrationState}
   ```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

[!INCLUDE [include-cloud-shell-local-powershell](includes/include-cloud-shell-local-powershell.md)]

2. Register the **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization** resource provider by running the following command. You can run this even if the resource provider is already registered.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization
   ```

3. In the output, verify that the parameters **RegistrationState** are set to *Registered*. You can also run the following command:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   Get-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization
   ```

## Identity

To access desktops and applications from your session hosts, your users need to be able to authenticate. [Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis.md) (Azure AD) is Microsoft's centralized cloud identity service that enables this capability. Azure AD is always used to authenticate users for Azure Virtual Desktop. Session hosts can be joined to the same Azure AD tenant, or to an Active Directory domain using [Active Directory Domain Services](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) (AD DS) or [Azure Active Directory Domain Services](../active-directory-domain-services/overview.md) (Azure AD DS), providing you with a choice of flexible configuration options.

### Session hosts

You need to join session hosts that provide desktops and applications to the same Azure AD tenant as your users, or an Active Directory domain (either AD DS or Azure AD DS).

To join session hosts to Azure AD or an Active Directory domain, you need the following permissions:

- For Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you need an account that can join computers to your tenant. For more information, see [Manage device identities](../active-directory/devices/manage-device-identities.md#configure-device-settings). To learn more about joining session hosts to Azure AD, see [Azure AD-joined session hosts](azure-ad-joined-session-hosts.md).

- For an Active Directory domain, you need a domain account that can join computers to your domain. For Azure AD DS, you would need to be a member of the [*AAD DC Administrators* group](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance-advanced.md#configure-an-administrative-group).

### Users

Your users need accounts that are in Azure AD. If you're also using AD DS or Azure AD DS in your deployment of Azure Virtual Desktop, these accounts will need to be [hybrid identities](../active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity.md), which means the user accounts are synchronized. You'll need to keep the following things in mind based on which identity provider you use:

- If you're using Azure AD with AD DS, you'll need to configure [Azure AD Connect](../active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect.md) to synchronize user identity data between AD DS and Azure AD.
- If you're using Azure AD with Azure AD DS, user accounts are synchronized one way from Azure AD to Azure AD DS. This synchronization process is automatic.

### Supported identity scenarios

The following table summarizes identity scenarios that Azure Virtual Desktop currently supports:

| Identity scenario | Session hosts | User accounts |
|--|--|--|
| Azure AD + AD DS | Joined to AD DS | In Azure AD and AD DS, synchronized |
| Azure AD + AD DS | Joined to Azure AD | In Azure AD and AD DS, synchronized |
| Azure AD + Azure AD DS | Joined to Azure AD DS | In Azure AD and Azure AD DS, synchronized |
| Azure AD + Azure AD DS + AD DS | Joined to Azure AD DS | In Azure AD and AD DS, synchronized |
| Azure AD + Azure AD DS | Joined to Azure AD | In Azure AD and Azure AD DS, synchronized|
| Azure AD only | Joined to Azure AD | In Azure AD |

To use [FSLogix Profile Container](/fslogix/configure-profile-container-tutorial) when joining your session hosts to Azure AD, you will need to [store profiles on Azure Files](create-profile-container-azure-ad.md) and your user accounts must be [hybrid identities](../active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity.md). This means you must create these accounts in AD DS and synchronize them to Azure AD. To learn more about deploying FSLogix Profile Container with different identity scenarios, see the following articles:

- [Set up FSLogix Profile Container with Azure Files and Active Directory Domain Services or Azure Active Directory Domain Services](fslogix-profile-container-configure-azure-files-active-directory.md).
- [Set up FSLogix Profile Container with Azure Files and Azure Active Directory](create-profile-container-azure-ad.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The user account must exist in the Azure AD tenant you use for Azure Virtual Desktop. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support [B2B](../active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b.md), [B2C](../active-directory-b2c/overview.md), or personal Microsoft accounts.
>
> When using hybrid identities, either the UserPrincipalName (UPN) or the Security Identifier (SID) must match across Active Directory Domain Services and Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Supported identities and authentication methods](authentication.md#hybrid-identity).

### Deployment parameters

You'll need to enter the following identity parameters when deploying session hosts:

- Domain name, if using AD DS or Azure AD DS.
- Credentials to join session hosts to the domain.
- Organizational Unit (OU), which is an optional parameter that lets you place session hosts in the desired OU at deployment time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The account you use for joining a domain can't have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.

## Operating systems and licenses

You have a choice of operating systems (OS) that you can use for session hosts to provide desktops and applications. You can use different operating systems with different host pools to provide flexibility to your users. We support the following 64-bit versions of these operating systems, where supported versions and dates are inline with the [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/).

|Operating system |User access rights|
|---|---|
|<ul><li>[Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session](/lifecycle/products/windows-11-enterprise-and-education)</li><li>[Windows 11 Enterprise](/lifecycle/products/windows-11-enterprise-and-education)</li><li>[Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session](/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education)</li><li>[Windows 10 Enterprise](/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education)</li><ul>|License entitlement:<ul><li>Microsoft 365 E3, E5, A3, A5, F3, Business Premium, Student Use Benefit</li><li>Windows Enterprise E3, E5</li><li>Windows VDA E3, E5</li><li>Windows Education A3, A5</li></ul>External users can use [per-user access pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-desktop/) by enrolling an Azure subscription instead of license entitlement.</li></ul>|

> 
> - Support for Windows 7 ended on January 10, 2023.

You can use operating system images provided by Microsoft in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com), or create your own custom images stored in an Azure Compute Gallery or as a managed image. Using custom image templates for Azure Virtual Desktop enables you to easily create a custom image that you can use when deploying session host virtual machines (VMs). To learn more about how to create custom images, see:

- [Custom image templates in Azure Virtual Desktop](custom-image-templates.md)
- [Store and share images in an Azure Compute Gallery](../virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries.md).
- [Create a managed image of a generalized VM in Azure](../virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource.md).

You can deploy a virtual machines (VMs) to be used as session hosts from these images with any of the following methods:

- Automatically, as part of the [host pool setup process](create-host-pool.md?tabs=portal) in the Azure portal.
- Manually by [adding session hosts to an existing host pool](add-session-hosts-host-pool.md?tabs=portal%2Cgui) in the Azure portal.
- Programmatically, with [Azure CLI](add-session-hosts-host-pool.md?tabs=cli%2Ccmd) or [Azure PowerShell](add-session-hosts-host-pool.md?tabs=powershell%2Ccmd).

If your license entitles you to use Azure Virtual Desktop, you don't need to install or apply a separate license, however if you're using per-user access pricing for external users, you will need to [enroll an Azure Subscription](remote-app-streaming/per-user-access-pricing.md). You will need to make sure the Windows license used on your session hosts is correctly assigned in Azure and the operating system is activated. For more information, see [Apply Windows license to session host virtual machines](apply-windows-license.md).

> [!TIP]
> To simplify user access rights during initial development and testing, Azure Virtual Desktop supports [Azure Dev/Test pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/dev-test/). If you deploy Azure Virtual Desktop in an Azure Dev/Test subscription, end users may connect to that deployment without separate license entitlement in order to perform acceptance tests or provide feedback.

## Network

There are several network requirements you'll need to meet to successfully deploy Azure Virtual Desktop. This lets users connect to their desktops and applications while also giving them the best possible user experience.

Users connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop securely establish a reverse connection to the service, which means you don't need to open any inbound ports. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) on port 443 is used by default, however RDP Shortpath can be used for [managed networks](shortpath.md) and [public networks](shortpath-public.md) that establishes a direct User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based transport.

To successfully deploy Azure Virtual Desktop, you'll need to meet the following network requirements:

- You'll need a virtual network and subnet for your session hosts. If you create your session hosts at the same time as a host pool, you must create this virtual network in advance for it to appear in the drop-down list. Your virtual network must be in the same Azure region as the session host.

- Make sure this virtual network can connect to your domain controllers and relevant DNS servers if you're using AD DS or Azure AD DS, since you'll need to join session hosts to the domain.

- Your session hosts and users need to be able to connect to the Azure Virtual Desktop service. These connections also use TCP on port 443 to a specific list of URLs. For more information, see [Required URL list](safe-url-list.md). You must make sure these URLs aren't blocked by network filtering or a firewall in order for your deployment to work properly and be supported. If your users need to access Microsoft 365, make sure your session hosts can connect to [Microsoft 365 endpoints](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-endpoints).

Also consider the following:

- Your users may need access to applications and data that is hosted on different networks, so make sure your session hosts can connect to them.

- Round-trip time (RTT) latency from the client's network to the Azure region that contains the host pools should be less than 150 ms. Use the [Experience Estimator](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-desktop/assessment/) to view your connection health and recommended Azure region. To optimize for network performance, we recommend you create session hosts in the Azure region closest to your users.

- Use [Azure Firewall for Azure Virtual Desktop deployments](../firewall/protect-azure-virtual-desktop.md) to help you lock down your environment and filter outbound traffic.

- To help secure your Azure Virtual Desktop environment in Azure, we recommend you don't open inbound port 3389 on your session hosts. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't require an open inbound port to be open. If you must open port 3389 for troubleshooting purposes, we recommend you use [just-in-time VM access](../security-center/security-center-just-in-time.md). We also recommend you don't assign a public IP address to your session hosts.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep Azure Virtual Desktop reliable and scalable, we aggregate traffic patterns and usage to check the health and performance of the infrastructure control plane. We aggregate this information from all locations where the service infrastructure is, then send it to the US region. The data sent to the US region includes scrubbed data, but not customer data. For more information, see [Data locations for Azure Virtual Desktop](data-locations.md).

To learn more, see [Understanding Azure Virtual Desktop network connectivity](network-connectivity.md).

## Session host management

Consider the following when managing session hosts:

- Don't enable any policies or configurations that disable *Windows Installer*. If you disable Windows Installer, the service won't be able to install agent updates on your session hosts, and your session hosts won't function properly.

- If you're joining session hosts to an AD DS domain and you want to manage them using [Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune), you'll need to configure [Azure AD Connect](../active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect.md) to enable [hybrid Azure AD join](../active-directory/devices/hybrid-join-plan.md).

- If you're joining session hosts to an Azure AD DS domain, you can't manage them using [Intune](/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).

- If you're using Azure AD-join with Windows Server for your session hosts, you can't enroll them in Intune as Windows Server is not supported with Intune. You'll need to use hybrid Azure AD-join and Group Policy from an Active Directory domain, or local Group Policy on each session host.

## Remote Desktop clients

Your users will need a [Remote Desktop client](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients) to connect to desktops and applications. The following clients support Azure Virtual Desktop:

- [Windows Desktop client](./users/connect-windows.md)
- [Azure Virtual Desktop Store app for Windows](./users/connect-windows-azure-virtual-desktop-app.md)
- [Web client](./users/connect-web.md)
- [macOS client](./users/connect-macos.md)
- [iOS and iPadOS client](./users/connect-ios-ipados.md)
- [Android and Chrome OS client](./users/connect-android-chrome-os.md)
- [Remote Desktop app for Windows](./users/connect-microsoft-store.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support connections from the RemoteApp and Desktop Connections (RADC) client or the Remote Desktop Connection (MSTSC) client.

To learn which URLs clients use to connect and that you must allow through firewalls and internet filters, see the [Required URL list](safe-url-list.md).
