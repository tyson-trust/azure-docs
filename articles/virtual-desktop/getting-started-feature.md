# Deploy Azure Virtual Desktop with the getting started feature

You can quickly deploy Azure Virtual Desktop with the *getting started* feature in the Azure portal. This can be used in smaller scenarios with a few users and apps, or you can use it to evaluate Azure Virtual Desktop in larger enterprise scenarios. It works with existing Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) or Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) deployments, or it can deploy Azure AD DS for you. Once you've finished, a user will be able to sign in to a full virtual desktop session, consisting of one host pool (with one or more session hosts), one application group, and one user. To learn about the terminology used in Azure Virtual Desktop, see [Azure Virtual Desktop terminology](environment-setup.md).

Joining session hosts to Azure Active Directory with the getting started feature is not supported. If you want to want to join session hosts to Azure Active Directory, follow the [tutorial to create a host pool](create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md).

> [!TIP]
> Enterprises should plan an Azure Virtual Desktop deployment using information from [Enterprise-scale support for Microsoft Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/wvd/enterprise-scale-landing-zone). You can also find more a granular deployment process in a [series of tutorials](create-host-pools-azure-marketplace.md), which also cover programmatic methods and less permission.

You can see the list of [resources that will be deployed](#resources-that-will-be-deployed) further down in this article.

## Prerequisites

Please review the [Prerequisites for Azure Virtual Desktop](prerequisites.md) to start for a general idea of what's required, however there are some differences when using the getting started feature that you'll need to meet. Select a tab below to show instructions that are most relevant to your scenario.

> [!TIP]
> If you don't already have other Azure resources, we recommend you select the **New Azure AD DS** tab. This scenario will deploy everything you need to be ready to connect to a full virtual desktop session. If you already have AD DS or Azure AD DS, select the relevant tab for your scenario instead.

# [New Azure AD DS](#tab/new-aadds)

At a high level, you'll need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription
- An account with the [global administrator Azure AD role](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal.md) assigned on the Azure tenant and the [owner role](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md) assigned on subscription you're going to use.
- No existing Azure AD DS domain deployed in your Azure tenant.
- User names you choose must not include any keywords [that the username guideline list doesn't allow](../virtual-machines/windows/faq.yml#what-are-the-username-requirements-when-creating-a-vm-), and you must use a unique user name that's not already in your Azure AD subscription.
- The user name for AD Domain join UPN should be a unique one that doesn't already exist in Azure AD. The getting started feature doesn't support using existing Azure AD user names when also deploying Azure AD DS.

# [Existing AD DS](#tab/existing-adds)

At a high level, you'll need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- An account with the [global administrator Azure AD role](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal.md) assigned on the Azure tenant and the [owner role](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md) assigned on subscription you're going to use.
- An AD DS domain controller deployed in Azure in the same subscription as the one you choose to use with the getting started feature. Using multiple subscriptions isn't supported. Make sure you know the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
- Domain admin credentials for your existing AD DS domain
- You must configure [Azure AD connect](../active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect.md) on your subscription and make sure the **Users** container is syncing with Azure AD. A security group called **AVDValidationUsers** will be created during deployment in the *Users* container by default. You can also pre-create the **AVDValidationUsers** security group in a different organization unit in your existing AD DS domain. You must make sure this group is then synchronized to Azure AD. 
- A virtual network in the same Azure region you want to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop to. We recommend that you [create a new virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) for Azure Virtual Desktop and use [virtual network peering](../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md) to peer it with the virtual network for AD DS or Azure AD DS. You also need to make sure you can resolve your AD DS or Azure AD DS domain name from this new virtual network.
- Internet access is required from your domain controller VM to download PowerShell DSC configuration from `https://wvdportalstorageblob.blob.core.windows.net/galleryartifacts/`.

> [!NOTE]
> The PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension will be added to your domain controller VM. A configuration will be added called **AddADDSUser** that contains PowerShell scripts to create the security group and test user, and to populate the security group with any users you choose to add during deployment.

# [Existing Azure AD DS](#tab/existing-aadds)

At a high level, you'll need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription.
- An account with the [global administrator Azure AD role](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal.md) assigned on the Azure tenant and the [owner role](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md) assigned on subscription you're going to use.
- Azure AD DS deployed in the same tenant and subscription. Peered subscriptions aren't supported. Make sure you know the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
- Your domain admin user needs to have the same UPN suffix in Azure AD and Azure AD DS. This means your Azure AD DS name is the same as your `.onmicrosoft.com` tenant name or you've added the domain name used for Azure AD DS as a verified custom domain name to Azure AD.
- An Azure AD account that is a member of **AAD DC Administrators** group in Azure AD.
- The *forest type* for Azure AD DS must be **User**.
- A virtual network in the same Azure region you want to deploy Azure Virtual Desktop to. We recommend that you [create a new virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) for Azure Virtual Desktop and use [virtual network peering](../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md) to peer it with the virtual network  or Azure AD DS. You also need to make sure you [configure DNS servers](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-networking.md#configure-dns-servers-in-the-peered-virtual-network) to resolve your Azure AD DS domain name from this virtual network for Azure Virtual Desktop.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The getting started feature doesn't currently support accounts that use multi-factor authentication. It also does not support personal Microsoft accounts (MSA) or [Azure AD B2B collaboration](../active-directory/external-identities/user-properties.md) users (either member or guest accounts).

## Connect to the desktop

Once the deployment has completed successfully, if you created a test account or assigned an existing user during deployment, you can connect to it following the steps for one of the supported Remote Desktop clients. For example, you can follow the steps to [Connect with the Windows Desktop client](users/connect-windows.md).

If you didn't create a test account or assigned an existing user during deployment, you'll need to add users to the **AVDValidationUsers** security group before you can connect.

## Clean up resources

If you want to remove Azure Virtual Desktop resources from your environment, you can safely remove them by deleting the resource groups that were deployed. These are:

- *your-prefix*-deployment
- *your-prefix*-avd
- *your-prefix*-prerequisite (only if you deployed the getting started feature with a new Azure AD DS domain)

To delete the resource groups:

1. Sign in to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search bar, type *Resource groups* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select the name of one of resource groups, then select **Delete resource group**.

1. Review the affected resources, then type the resource group name in the box, and select **Delete**.

1. Repeat these steps for the remaining resource groups.
