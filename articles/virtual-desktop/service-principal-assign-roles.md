# Assign RBAC roles to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal

Several Azure Virtual Desktop features require you to assign Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) roles to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal. Features you need to assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal for include:

- [Autoscale](autoscale-scaling-plan.md)
- [Start VM on Connect](start-virtual-machine-connect.md)

> [!TIP]
> You can find which role you need to assign in the article for each feature. For a list of all the available roles specifically Azure Virtual Desktop, see [Built-in Azure RBAC roles for Azure Virtual Desktop](rbac.md) Learn more about Azure RBAC at [Azure RBAC documentation](../role-based-access-control/index.yml).

Depending on when you registered the *Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization* resource provider, the service principal is called either *Azure Virtual Desktop* or *Windows Virtual Desktop*. If you've also previously had an Azure Virtual Desktop Classic deployment and an Azure Virtual Desktop (Azure Resource Manager) deployment, you'll likely see two apps with the same name. The application ID for the service principal is **9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07**.

This article shows you how to assign a role to the correct Azure Virtual Desktop service principal by using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

- You must have the `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permission to an Azure subscription in order to assign roles on that subscription. This permission is part of the [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) or [User Access Administrator](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) built in roles.

- We recommend using [Azure Cloud Shell](../cloud-shell/overview.md) for running Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell commands. Alternatively, if you want to use Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell locally, see [Use Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell with Azure Virtual Desktop](cli-powershell.md) to make sure you have the [desktopvirtualization](/cli/azure/desktopvirtualization) Azure CLI extension or the [Az.DesktopVirtualization](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization) PowerShell module installed. 

## Assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal

To assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal, select the relevant tab for your scenario and follow the steps. In these examples, the scope of the role assignment is an Azure subscription, but you will need to use the scope and the role required by each feature.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

Here's how to assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal using the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. In the search box, enter *Azure Active Directory* and select the matching service entry.

1. On the Overview page, in the search box for **Search your tenant**, enter the application ID **9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07**.

1. In the results, select the matching enterprise application, either **Azure Virtual Desktop** or **Windows Virtual Desktop**.

1. Under properties, make a note of the **name** and the **object ID**. The object ID correlates to the application ID, and is unique to your tenant.

1. In the search box, enter *Subscriptions* and select the matching service entry.

1. Select the subscription you want to add the role assignment to.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**, then select **+ Add** followed by **Add role assignment**.

1. Select the role you want to assign to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal, then select **Next**.

1. Ensure **Assign access to** is set to **Azure AD user, group, or service principal**, then select **Select members**.

1. Enter the name of the enterprise application you made a note of earlier, either **Azure Virtual Desktop** or **Windows Virtual Desktop**.

1. Select the matching entry from the results, then select **Select**. If you have two entries with the same name, select them both.

1. Review the list of members in the table. If you have two entries, remove the entry that doesn't match the object ID you made a note of earlier.

1. Select **Next**, then select **Review + assign** to complete the role assignment.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Here's how to assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal using the [desktopvirtualization](/cli/azure/desktopvirtualization) extension for Azure CLI.

[!INCLUDE [include-cloud-shell-local-cli](includes/include-cloud-shell-local-cli.md)]

2. Find the ID of the subscription you want to add the role assignment to by listing all that are available to you with the following command:

   ```azurecli
   az account list --output table
   ```

3. Store the value for **SubscriptionId** in a variable by running the following command, replacing the subscription ID in this example with your own:

   ```azurecli
   subId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
   ```

4. Assign the role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal by running the following command, replacing the value for the `role` parameter with the name of the role you need to assign. This example assigns the *Desktop Virtualization Power On Off Contributor* role to the subscription:

   ```azurecli
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee "9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07" \
       --role "Desktop Virtualization Power On Off Contributor" \
       --scope "/subscriptions/$subId"
   ```

   Your output should be similar to the following:

   ```output
   {
     "condition": null,
     "conditionVersion": null,
     "createdBy": null,
     "createdOn": "2023-06-22T13:50:22.978226+00:00",
     "delegatedManagedIdentityResourceId": null,
     "description": null,
     "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/a211100e-aa52-4f8d-aac9-ad0833f969d0",
     "name": "a211100e-aa52-4f8d-aac9-ad0833f969d0",
     "principalId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
     "principalType": "ServicePrincipal",
     "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/40c5ff49-9181-41f8-ae61-143b0e78555e",
     "scope": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
     "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
     "updatedBy": "effe20b0-5afb-4e68-a5d7-f8ef9873a070",
     "updatedOn": "2023-06-22T13:50:23.335229+00:00"
   }
   ```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Here's how to assign a role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal using the [Az.DesktopVirtualization](/powershell/module/az.desktopvirtualization) PowerShell module.

[!INCLUDE [include-cloud-shell-local-powershell](includes/include-cloud-shell-local-powershell.md)]

2. Find the ID of the subscription you want to add the role assignment to by listing all that are available to you with the following command:

   ```azurepowershell
   Get-AzSubscription
   ```

3. Store the subscription ID in a variable by running the following command, replacing the subscription ID in this example with your own:

   ```azurepowershell
   $subId = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
   ```

4. Assign the role to the Azure Virtual Desktop service principal by running the following command, replacing the value for the `RoleDefinitionName` parameter with the name of the role you need to assign. This example assigns the *Desktop Virtualization Power On Off Contributor* role to the subscription:

   ```azurepowershell
   $parameters = @{
       RoleDefinitionName = "Desktop Virtualization Power On Off Contributor"
       ApplicationId = "9cdead84-a844-4324-93f2-b2e6bb768d07"
       Scope = "/subscriptions/$subId"
   }
   
   New-AzRoleAssignment @parameters
   ```

   Your output should be similar to the following:

   ```output
   RoleAssignmentName : c5221262-d1fa-4d32-9d60-8bd86f618d20
   RoleAssignmentId   : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/c5221262-d1fa-4d32-9d60-8bd86f618d20
   Scope              : /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
   DisplayName        : Azure Virtual Desktop
   SignInName         : 
   RoleDefinitionName : Desktop Virtualization Power On Off Contributor
   RoleDefinitionId   : 40c5ff49-9181-41f8-ae61-143b0e78555e
   ObjectId           : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
   ObjectType         : ServicePrincipal
   CanDelegate        : False
   Description        : 
   ConditionVersion   : 
   Condition          :
   ```
