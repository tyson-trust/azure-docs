# Use multimedia redirection on Azure Virtual Desktop

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multimedia redirection call redirection is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

This article will show you how to use multimedia redirection for Azure Virtual Desktop with Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browsers. For more information about how multimedia redirection works, see [Understanding multimedia redirection for Azure Virtual Desktop](multimedia-redirection-intro.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can use multimedia redirection on Azure Virtual Desktop, you'll need the following things:

- An Azure Virtual Desktop deployment.
- Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome installed on your session hosts.
- Windows Desktop client:
   - To use video playback redirection, you must install [Windows Desktop client, version 1.2.3916 or later](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/windowsdesktop-whatsnew). This feature is only compatible with version 1.2.3916 or later of the Windows Desktop client.

   - To use call redirection, you must install the Windows Desktop client, version 1.2.4237 or later with [Insider releases enabled](./users/client-features-windows.md#enable-insider-releases).

- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022, version 14.32.31332.0 or later installed on your session hosts and Windows client devices. You can download the latest version from [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported downloads](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

- Your device must meet the [hardware requirements for Teams on a Windows PC](/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app#hardware-requirements-for-teams-on-a-windows-pc/).

> [!NOTE]
> Multimedia redirection isn't supported on Azure Virtual Desktop for Microsoft 365 Government (GCC), GCC-High environments, and Microsoft 365 DoD.

## Install the multimedia redirection extension

For multimedia redirection to work, there are two parts to install on your session hosts: the host component and the browser extension for Edge or Chrome. You install both the host component and browser extension for Edge or Chrome browsers on your session hosts from an MSI file. You can also get and install the browser extension from Microsoft Edge Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store.

### Install the host component and browser extension from an MSI file

To install the host component on your session hosts, you can install the MSI manually on each session host or use your enterprise deployment tool with `msiexec`. To install the MSI manually, you'll need to:

1. Sign in to a session host as a local administrator.

1. Download the [multimedia redirection host MSI installer](https://aka.ms/avdmmr/msi).

1. Open the file that you downloaded to run the setup wizard.

1. Follow the prompts. Once it's finished installing, select **Finish**.

### Enable the browser extension

Next, users need to enable the browser extension in a remote session to use multimedia redirection with Edge or Chrome.

> [!TIP]
> You can also automate installing and enabling the browser extension from Microsoft Edge Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store for all users by [using Group Policy](#install-the-browser-extension-using-group-policy).

1. Sign in to Azure Virtual Desktop and open Edge or Chrome.

1. When opening the browser, after a short while, users will see a prompt that says **New Extension added**. Once the prompt appears, users should select **Turn on extension**. Users should also pin the extension so that they can see from the icon if multimedia redirection is connected.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >If the user selects **Remove extension**, it will be removed from the browser and they will need to add it from Microsoft Edge Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store. To install it again, see [Install the browser extension manually (optional)](#install-the-browser-extension-manually-optional).

Using Group Policy has the following benefits:

- You can install the extension silently and without user interaction.
- You can restrict which websites use multimedia redirection.
- You can pin the extension icon in Google Chrome by default.

#### Install the browser extension manually (optional)

If installing the host component doesn't automatically install the extension, you can also download it from Microsoft Edge Add-ons or the Chrome Web Store.

To install the multimedia redirection extension manually, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Azure Virtual Desktop.

1. In your browser, open one of the following links, depending on which browser you're using:

   - For **Microsoft Edge**: [Microsoft multimedia redirection Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/wvd-multimedia-redirectio/joeclbldhdmoijbaagobkhlpfjglcihd)

   - For **Google Chrome**: [Microsoft multimedia redirection Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wvd-multimedia-redirectio/lfmemoeeciijgkjkgbgikoonlkabmlno)

1. Install the extension by selecting **Get** (for Microsoft Edge) or **Add to Chrome** (for Google Chrome), then at the additional prompt, select **Add extension**. Once the installation is finished, you'll see a confirmation message saying that you've successfully added the extension.

#### Install the browser extension using Group Policy

You can install the multimedia redirection extension using Group Policy, either centrally from your domain for session hosts that are joined to an Active Directory (AD) domain, or using the Local Group Policy Editor for each session host. This process will change depending on which browser you're using.

# [Edge](#tab/edge)

1. Download and install the Microsoft Edge administrative template by following the directions in [Configure Microsoft Edge policy settings on Windows devices](/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#1-download-and-install-the-microsoft-edge-administrative-template)

1. Next, decide whether you want to configure Group Policy centrally from your domain or locally for each session host:
   
   - To configure it from an AD Domain, open the **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC) and create or edit a policy that targets your session hosts.
   
   - To configure it locally, open the **Local Group Policy Editor** on the session host.

1. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Edge** > **Extensions**.

1. Open the policy setting **Configure extension management settings** and set it to **Enabled**.

1. In the field for **Configure extension management settings**, enter the following:

   ```json
   { "joeclbldhdmoijbaagobkhlpfjglcihd": { "installation_mode": "force_installed", "update_url": "https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx" } }
   ```

   You can specify additional parameters to allow or block specific domains. For example, to only allow *youtube.com*, enter the following:

   ```json
   { "joeclbldhdmoijbaagobkhlpfjglcihd": { "installation_mode": "force_installed", "runtime_allowed_hosts": [ "*://*.youtube.com" ], "runtime_blocked_hosts": [ "*://*" ], "update_url": "https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx" } }
   ```

1. Apply the changes by running the following command in Command Prompt or PowerShell on each session host:

   ```cmd
   gpupdate /force
   ```

# [Google Chrome](#tab/google-chrome)

1. Download and install the Google Chrome administrative template by following the instructions in [Set Chrome Browser policies on managed PCs](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202#zippy=%2Cwindows)

1. Next, decide whether you want to configure Group Policy centrally from your domain or locally for each session host:
   
   - To configure it from an AD Domain, open the **Group Policy Management Console** (GPMC) and create or edit a policy that targets your session hosts.
   
   - To configure it locally, open the **Local Group Policy Editor** on the session host.

1. Go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Google** > **Google Chrome** > **Extensions**.

1. Open the policy setting **Extension management settings** and set it to **Enabled**.

1. In the field for **Extension management settings**, enter the following:

   ```json
   { "lfmemoeeciijgkjkgbgikoonlkabmlno": { "installation_mode": "force_installed", "update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx" } }
   ```

   You can specify additional parameters to allow or block specific domains. For example, to only allow *youtube.com* and pin the extension to the toolbar, enter the following:

   ```json
   { "lfmemoeeciijgkjkgbgikoonlkabmlno": { "installation_mode": "force_installed", "runtime_allowed_hosts": [ "*://*.youtube.com" ], "runtime_blocked_hosts": [ "*://*" ], "toolbar_pin": "force_pinned", "update_url": "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx" } }
   ```

1. Apply the changes by running the following command in Command Prompt or PowerShell on each session host:

   ```cmd
   gpupdate /force
   ```
