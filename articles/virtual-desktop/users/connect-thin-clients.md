>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you encounter an issue when trying to connect to Azure Virtual Desktop, you must verify whether it's unique to your approved partner thin client. You can verify whether this is a unique issue by trying to reproduce it on [any first-party Remote Desktop client](remote-desktop-clients-overview.md). If you can't reproduce the issue on a first-party client, then you must contact your client's provider for support.
