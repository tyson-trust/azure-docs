### You don't see the expected resources

If you don't see the remote resources you're expecting to see in the app, check the account you're using. If you've already signed in with a different account than the one you want to use for Azure Virtual Desktop, you should first sign out, then sign in again with the correct account. If you're using the Remote Desktop Web client, you can use an InPrivate browser window to try a different account.

If you're using the correct account, make sure your application group is associated with a workspace.
