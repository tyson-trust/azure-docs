    questions:
      - question: |
          How much time does it takes to restore?
        answer: |
          Restore time is a function of the data size, the amount of log backup that needs to be replayed, and the number of partitions that need to be restored. Restoring 1 terabyte of data typically takes 30 to 90 minutes.
      - question: |
          Can I submit the restore time in local time?
        answer: |
          The restore might not happen, depending on whether key resources like databases or containers existed at that time. You can verify by entering the time and looking at a selected database or container for that time. If that is no resources exist to restore, the restore process doesn't work.
      - question: |
          How can I track the restoration of an account?

      - question: |
          How can I find out whether a continuous backup mode account was restored from another account?
        answer: |
          You can identify whether an account is restored and gets the restore details by using the [Azure portal](restore-account-continuous-backup.md#get-the-restore-details-portal), [Azure PowerShell](restore-account-continuous-backup.md#get-the-restore-details-powershell), and the [Azure CLI](restore-account-continuous-backup.md#get-the-restore-details-cli).          
      - question: |
          What is "instanceId" in the account definition?
        answer: |

      - question: |
          Is continuous backup supported for Azure Synapse Link-enabled accounts?
        answer: |
          No. Currently, continuous backup mode and Azure Synapse Link can't coexist in the same database account.
