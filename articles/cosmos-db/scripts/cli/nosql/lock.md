# Create resource lock for an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL database and container using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../../../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

The script in this article demonstrates performing resource lock operations for a SQL database and container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> To create resource locks, you must have membership in the owner role in the subscription.
>
> Resource locks do not work for changes made by users connecting using any Azure Cosmos DB SDK, any tools that connect via account keys, or the Azure Portal unless the Azure Cosmos DB account is first locked with the `disableKeyBasedMetadataWriteAccess` property enabled. To learn more about how to enable this property see, [Preventing changes from SDKs](../../../role-based-access-control.md#prevent-sdk-changes).
