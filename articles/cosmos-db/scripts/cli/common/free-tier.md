# Find an existing Azure Cosmos DB free-tier account in a subscription using Azure CLI

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table](../../../includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table.md)]

The script in this article demonstrates how to locate an Azure Cosmos DB free-tier account within a subscription.

Each Azure subscription can have up to one Azure Cosmos DB free-tier account. If you're trying to create a free-tier account, the option may be disabled in the Azure portal, or you get an error when attempting to create a free-tier account. If either of these issues occur, use this script to locate the name of the existing free-tier account, and the resource group it belongs to.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

- This article requires version 2.9.1 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.
