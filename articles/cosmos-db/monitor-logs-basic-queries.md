# Troubleshoot issues with diagnostics queries

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table.md)]

In this article, we cover how to write simple queries to help troubleshoot issues with your Azure Cosmos DB account using diagnostics logs sent to **AzureDiagnostics (legacy)** and **Resource-specific (preview)** tables.

For Azure Diagnostics tables, all data is written into one single table and users need to specify which category they'd like to query.

For resource-specific tables, data is written into individual tables for each category of the resource (not available for table API). We recommend this mode since it makes it much easier to work with the data, provides better discoverability of the schemas, and improves performance across both ingestion latency and query times.

## Common queries

Here's a list of common troubleshooting queries.

### Query for operations that are taking longer than 3 milliseconds to run

Find operations that have a duration greater than 3 milliseconds.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics 
| where toint(duration_s) > 3 and ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" 
| summarize count() by clientIpAddress_s, TimeGenerated
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests 
| where toint(DurationMs) > 3
| summarize count() by ClientIpAddress, TimeGenerated
```

---

### Query for user agents that are running operations

Find user agents associated with each operation.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics 
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" 
| summarize count() by OperationName, userAgent_s
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| summarize count() by OperationName, UserAgent
```

---
### Query for long-running operations

Find operations that ran for a long time by binning their runtime into five-second intervals.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics 
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" 
| project TimeGenerated , duration_s 
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5s)
| render timechart
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| project TimeGenerated , DurationMs 
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5s)
| render timechart
```

---

### Get partition key statistics to evaluate skew across top three partitions for a database account

Measure skew by getting common statistics for physical partitions.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics 
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="PartitionKeyStatistics" 
| project SubscriptionId, regionName_s, databaseName_s, collectionName_s, partitionKey_s, sizeKb_d, ResourceId 
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBPartitionKeyStatistics
| project RegionName, DatabaseName, CollectionName, PartitionKey, SizeKb
```

---

### Get the request charges for expensive queries

Measure the request charge (in RUs) for the largest queries.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

```Kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" and todouble(requestCharge_s) > 10.0
| project activityId_g, requestCharge_s
| join kind= inner (
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider =="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category == "QueryRuntimeStatistics"
| project activityId_g, querytext_s
) on $left.activityId_g == $right.activityId_g
| order by requestCharge_s desc
| limit 100
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| where todouble(RequestCharge) > 10.0
| project ActivityId, RequestCharge
| join kind= inner (
CDBQueryRuntimeStatistics
| project ActivityId, QueryText
) on $left.ActivityId == $right.ActivityId
| order by RequestCharge desc
| limit 100
```

---

### Find which operations are taking most RU/s

Sort operations by the amount of RU/s they're using.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests"
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(2h) 
| summarize max(responseLength_s), max(requestLength_s), max(requestCharge_s), count = count() by OperationName, requestResourceType_s, userAgent_s, collectionRid_s, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(2h) 
| summarize max(ResponseLength), max(RequestLength), max(RequestCharge), count = count() by OperationName, RequestResourceType, UserAgent, CollectionName, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```

---

### Get all queries that are consuming more than 100 RU/s

Find queries that consume more RU/s than a baseline amount.

#### [Resource-specific](#tab/resource-specific)

This query joins with data from ``DataPlaneRequests`` and ``QueryRunTimeStatistics``.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider=="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category=="DataPlaneRequests" and todouble(requestCharge_s) > 100.0
| project activityId_g, requestCharge_s
| join kind= inner (
        AzureDiagnostics
        | where ResourceProvider =="MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB" and Category == "QueryRuntimeStatistics"
        | project activityId_g, querytext_s
) on $left.activityId_g == $right.activityId_g
| order by requestCharge_s desc
| limit 100
```

#### [Azure Diagnostics](#tab/azure-diagnostics)

```kusto
CDBDataPlaneRequests
| where todouble(RequestCharge) > 100.0

### Get control plane logs

Get control plane long using ``ControlPlaneRequests``.

> [!TIP]
> Remember to switch on the flag described in [Disable key-based metadata write access](audit-control-plane-logs.md#disable-key-based-metadata-write-access), and execute the operations by using Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or Azure Resource Manager.
