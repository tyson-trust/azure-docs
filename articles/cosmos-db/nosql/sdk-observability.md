# Azure Cosmos DB SDK observability
[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

The Azure Cosmos DB .NET and Java SDKs support distributed tracing to help you monitor your applications. Tracing the flow of requests is helpful in debugging, analyzing latency and performance, and gathering diagnostics. Instrument tracing for your applications using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), which is vendor-neutral and has a set of semantic conventions to ensure a standardized data format regardless of your chosen exporter, or use the [Application Insights SDK or Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](../../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md#how-do-i-use-application-insights).

## Get started

Distributed tracing is available in the following SDKs:

|SDK |Supported version |Notes |
|----|------------------|------|
|.NET v3 SDK |[>= `3.33.0-preview`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos/3.33.0-preview) |This feature is on by default if you're using a supported preview SDK version. You can disable tracing by setting `IsDistributedTracingEnabled = false` in `CosmosClientOptions`. |
|Java v4 SDK |[>= `4.43.0`](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-cosmos/4.43.0) | |

## Trace attributes

Azure Cosmos DB traces follow the [OpenTelemetry database specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/database.md) and also provide several custom attributes. You may see different attributes depending on the operation of your request, and these attributes are core attributes for all requests.

|Attribute |Type |Description |
|----------|-----|------------|
| `net.peer.name` | string | Azure Cosmos DB host name. |
| `db.name` | string | Azure Cosmos DB database name. |
| `db.system` | string | Identifier for the database service. Is `cosmosdb` for all requests. |
| `db.operation` | string | Operation name, ex. `CreateItemAsync`. |
| `db.cosmosdb.container` | string | Azure Cosmos DB container name. |
| `db.cosmosdb.client_id` | string | Identifier representing a unique client instance. |
| `db.cosmosdb.operation_type` | string | Operation type, ex. `Create`. |
| `db.cosmosdb.connection_mode` | string | Client connection mode. Either `direct` or `gateway`. |
| `db.cosmosdb.status_code` | int | Status code for the request. |
| `db.cosmosdb.sub_status_code` | int | Sub status code for the request. | 
| `db.cosmosdb.request_charge` | double | RUs consumed for the operation. |
| `db.cosmosdb.regions_contacted` | string | List of regions contacted in the Azure Cosmos DB account. |
| `user_agent.original` | string | Full user-agent string generated by the Azure Cosmos DB SDK. |

For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB custom attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/database.md#microsoft-azure-cosmos-db-attributes).

### Gather diagnostics

If you've configured logs in your trace provider, you can automatically get [diagnostics](./troubleshoot-dotnet-sdk.md#capture-diagnostics) for Azure Cosmos DB requests that failed or had high latency. These logs can help you diagnose failed and slow requests without requiring any custom code to capture them. 

### [.NET](#tab/dotnet)

In addition to getting diagnostic logs for failed requests, point operations that take over 100 ms and query operations that take over 500 ms also generate diagnostics. You can configure the log level to control which diagnostics logs you receive.

|Log Level |Description |
|----------|------------|
|Error | Logs for errors only. |
|Warning | Logs for errors and high latency requests. |
|Information | There are no specific information level logs. Logs in this level are the same as using Warning. |

Depending on your application environment, there are different ways to configure the log level. Here's a sample configuration in `appSettings.json`:

```json
{ 
    "Logging": {​
        "LogLevel": {​
            "Azure-Cosmos-Operation-Request-Diagnostics": "Information"​
        }​
    }
}
```

### [Java](#tab/java)

In addition to getting diagnostic logs for failed requests, you can configure different conditions for when to collect diagnostics from successful requests. Conditions include a latency threshold for both point operations and non point operations and a threshold for requests that exceed a number of RUs. These thresholds can be set in the Azure Cosmos DB client.

```java
    CosmosAsyncClient client = new CosmosClientBuilder()
            .endpoint("<Your account endpoint>")
            .key("<Your account key>")
            .clientTelemetryConfig(new CosmosClientTelemetryConfig()
                .diagnosticsThresholds(
                    new CosmosDiagnosticsThresholds()
                        .setPointOperationLatencyThreshold(Duration.ofMillis(100))
                        .setNonPointOperationLatencyThreshold(Duration.ofMillis(2000))
                        .setRequestChargeThreshold(100)))
            .buildAsyncClient();
```

## Configure OpenTelemetry

To use OpenTelemetry with the Azure Cosmos DB SDKs, add the `Azure.Cosmos.Operation` source to your trace provider. OpenTelemetry is compatible with many exporters that can ingest your data. The following sample uses the `Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Exporter`, but you can choose to configure any exporter you wish. Depending on your chosen exporter, you may see a delay ingesting data of up to a few minutes.

> [!TIP]
> If you use the `Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.Exporter` package, ensure you're using version >= `1.0.0-beta.11`.
> If you're using ASP.NET Core and Azure Monitor, we recommend using the [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distro](../../azure-monitor/app/opentelemetry-enable.md) instead.

This sample shows how to configure OpenTelemetry for a .NET console app. See the [complete sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/tree/master/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/OpenTelemetry) on GitHub.

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/OpenTelemetry/Program.cs?name=SetUpOpenTelemetry)]

## Configure the Application Insights SDK

There are many different ways to configure Application Insights depending on the language your application is written in and your compute environment. For more information, see the [Application Insights documentation](../../azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview.md#how-do-i-use-application-insights). Ingestion of data into Application Insights may take up to a few minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> Use version >= `2.22.0-beta2` of the Application Insights package for your target .NET environment.

The following sample shows how to configure Application Insights for a .NET console app. See the [complete sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/tree/master/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/OpenTelemetry) on GitHub.

[!code-csharp[Main](~/samples-cosmosdb-dotnet-v3/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/ApplicationInsights/Program.cs?name=SetUpApplicationInsights)]

Once trace data is ingested into Application Insights, you can visualize it in the Azure portal to understand the request flow in your application. Here's an example of trace data from a cross partition query in the transaction search in the left navigation of the Azure portal.
