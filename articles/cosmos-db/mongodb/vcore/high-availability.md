# High availability in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

High availability (HA) avoids database downtime by maintaining standby replicas of every node in a cluster. If a node goes down, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore switches incoming connections from the failed node to its standby replica.

## How it works

When HA is enabled, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore runs one replica node for each primary node in the cluster. The primary and its replica use synchronous replication. The service detects failures on primary nodes and fails over to the replica nodes with zero data loss. The MongoDB connection string remains the same.

When HA is enabled, HA replica nodes are provisioned in a different availability zone from their primary nodes, if the region supports multiple zones and has available capacity. HA replicas don't receive requests from clients unless their primary node fails.

Even without HA enabled, each node has its own locally redundant storage (LRS) with three synchronous replicas maintained by Azure Storage service. If there's a single replica failure, the Azure Storage service detects the failure, and transparently re-creates the relevant data. For LRS storage durability, see metrics on [this page](../../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md#summary-of-redundancy-options).

## Configure high availability

High availability (HA) can be specified when [creating a cluster](quickstart-portal.md) or in the [**Scale** section of an existing cluster](how-to-scale-cluster.md) in the Azure portal.
