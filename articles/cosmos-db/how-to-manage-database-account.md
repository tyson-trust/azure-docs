# Manage an Azure Cosmos DB account by using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table.md)]

This article describes how to manage various tasks on an Azure Cosmos DB account by using the Azure portal. Azure Cosmos DB can also be managed with other Azure management clients including [Azure PowerShell](manage-with-powershell.md), [Azure CLI](nosql/manage-with-cli.md), [Azure Resource Manager templates](./manage-with-templates.md), [Bicep](nosql/manage-with-bicep.md), and [Terraform](nosql/samples-terraform.md).

> [!TIP]
> The management API for Azure Cosmos DB or *control plane* is not designed for high request volumes like the rest of the service. To learn more see [Control Plane Service Limits](concepts-limits.md#control-plane)

## Create an account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount.md)]

## Add/remove regions from your database account

> [!TIP]
> When a new region is added, all data must be fully replicated and committed into the new region before the region is marked as available. The amount of time this operation takes depends upon how much data is stored within the account. If an [asynchronous throughput scaling operation](scaling-provisioned-throughput-best-practices.md#background-on-scaling-rus) is in progress, the throughput scale-up operation is paused and resumes automatically when the add/remove region operation is complete.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to your Azure Cosmos DB account and select **Replicate data globally** in the resource menu.

1. To add regions, select the hexagons on the map with the **+** label that corresponds to your desired region(s). Alternatively, to add a region, select the **+ Add region** option and choose a region from the drop-down menu.

1. To remove regions, clear one or more regions from the map by selecting the blue hexagons with check marks. You can also select the "wastebasket" (ðŸ—‘) icon next to the region on the right side.

1. To save your changes, select **OK**.

In a single-region write mode, you can't remove the write region. You must fail over to a different region before you can delete the current write region.

In a multi-region write mode, you can add or remove any region, if you have at least one region.

## <a id="configure-multiple-write-regions"></a>Configure multiple write-regions

Open the **Replicate data globally** tab and select **Enable** to enable multi-region writes. After you enable multi-region writes, all the read regions that you currently have on the account will become read and write regions.

:::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/single-to-multi-master.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Replicate data globally menu, highlighting Configure regions and Save.":::

## <a id="automatic-failover"></a>Enable service-managed failover for your Azure Cosmos DB account

The Service-Managed failover option allows Azure Cosmos DB to fail over to the region with the highest failover priority with no user action should a region become unavailable. When service-managed failover is enabled, region priority can be modified. Your account must have two or more regions to enable service-managed failover.

1. From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open the **Replicate data globally** pane.

1. At the top of the pane, select **Service-Managed Failover**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/replicate-data-globally.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the replicate data globally menu.":::

1. On the **Service-Managed Failover** pane, make sure that **Enable Service-Managed Failover** is set to **ON**.

1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/automatic-failover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Service-Managed failover portal menu.":::

## Set failover priorities for your Azure Cosmos DB account

After an Azure Cosmos DB account is configured for service-managed failover, the failover priority for regions can be changed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't modify the write region (failover priority of zero) when the account is configured for service-managed failover. To change the write region, you must disable service-managed failover and do a manual failover.

1. From your Azure Cosmos DB account, open the **Replicate data globally** pane.

1. At the top of the pane, select **Service-Managed Failover**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/replicate-data-globally.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Replicate data globally menu.":::

1. On the **Service-Managed Failover** pane, make sure that **Enable Service-Managed Failover** is set to **ON**.

1. To modify the failover priority, drag the read regions via the three dots on the left side of the row that appear when you hover over them.

1. Select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/automatic-failover.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Service-Managed failover portal menu.":::

## <a id="manual-failover"></a>Perform manual failover on an Azure Cosmos DB account

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Azure Cosmos DB account must be configured for manual failover for this operation to succeed.

> [!NOTE]
> If you perform a manual failover operation while an asynchronous throughput scaling operation is in progress, the throughput scale-up operation will be paused. It resumes automatically when the failover operation is complete. For more information, see [Best practices for scaling provisioned throughput (RU/s)](scaling-provisioned-throughput-best-practices.md#background-on-scaling-rus)

1. Go to your Azure Cosmos DB account and open the **Replicate data globally** menu.

1. At the top of the menu, select **Manual Failover**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-database-account/replicate-data-globally.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Replicate data globally menu.":::

1. On the **Manual Failover** menu, select your new write region. Select the check box to indicate that you understand this option changes your write region.

1. To trigger the failover, select **OK**.
