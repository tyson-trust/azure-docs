## Capacity planner modes

- Basic

  Provides a quick, high-level RU/s and cost estimate. This mode assumes the default Azure Cosmos DB settings for indexing policy, consistency, and other parameters.

  Use basic mode for a quick, high-level estimate when you're evaluating a potential workload to run on Azure Cosmos DB. To learn more, see how to [estimate cost with basic mode](#basic-mode).

- Advanced

  Provides a more detailed RU/s and cost estimate, with the ability to tune more settings: indexing policy, consistency level, and other parameters that affect the cost and throughput.

  Use advanced mode when you're estimating RU/s for a new project or want a more detailed estimate. To learn more, see how to [estimate cost with advanced mode](#advanced-mode).
