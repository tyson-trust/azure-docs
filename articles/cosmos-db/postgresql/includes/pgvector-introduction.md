The `pgvector` extension adds an open-source vector similarity search to PostgreSQL.

This article introduces us to extra capabilities enabled by `pgvector`. It covers the concepts of vector similarity and embeddings, and provides guidance on how to enable the pgvector extension. We learn about, how to create, store and query the vectors.
You may also want to refer to the official [README](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/README.md) of the project.
