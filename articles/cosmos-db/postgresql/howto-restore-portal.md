# Point-in-time restore of a cluster in Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

This article provides step-by-step procedures to perform [point-in-time
recoveries](concepts-backup.md#restore) for a
cluster using backups. You can restore either to the earliest backup or to
a custom restore point within your retention period.

## Restore to the earliest restore point

Follow these steps to restore your cluster to its
earliest existing backup.

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), from the **Overview** page of the cluster you want to restore, select **Restore**.

1. On the **Restore** page, select the **Earliest** restore point, which is shown.

1. Provide a new cluster name in the **Restore to new cluster** field. The subscription, resource group, and location fields aren't editable.

1. Select **OK**. A notification shows that the restore operation is initiated.

1. When the restore completes, follow the [post-restore tasks](#post-restore-tasks).

## Restore to a custom restore point

Follow these steps to restore your cluster to a date
and time of your choosing.

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), from the **Overview** page of the cluster you want to restore, select **Restore**.

1. On the **Restore** page, choose **Custom restore point**.

1. Select a date and provide a time in the date and time fields, and enter a cluster name in the **Restore to new cluster** field. The other fields aren't editable.
 
1. Select **OK**. A notification shows that the restore operation is initiated.

1. When the restore completes, follow the [post-restore tasks](#post-restore-tasks).

## Post-restore tasks

After a restore, you should do the following to get your users and applications
back up and running:

* If the new server is meant to replace the original server, redirect clients
  and client applications to the new server
* Ensure appropriate [networking settings for private or public access](./concepts-security-overview.md#network-security) are in place for
  users to connect. These settings aren't copied from the original cluster.
* Ensure appropriate [logins](./howto-create-users.md) and database level permissions are in place.
* Configure [alerts](./howto-alert-on-metric.md#suggested-alerts), as appropriate.

## Next steps

* Learn more about [backup and restore](concepts-backup.md) in
  Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL.
* Set [suggested alerts](./howto-alert-on-metric.md#suggested-alerts) on clusters.
