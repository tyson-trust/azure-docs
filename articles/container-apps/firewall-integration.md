# Securing a custom VNET in Azure Container Apps  with Network Security Groups

Network Security Groups (NSGs) needed to configure virtual networks closely resemble the settings required by Kubernetes.

You can lock down a network via NSGs with more restrictive rules than the default NSG rules to control all inbound and outbound traffic for the Container Apps environment at the subscription level.

In the workload profiles environment, user-defined routes (UDRs) and securing outbound traffic with a firewall are supported. Learn more in the [networking concepts document](./networking.md#user-defined-routes-udr---preview).

In the Consumption only environment, custom user-defined routes (UDRs) and ExpressRoutes aren't supported.

## NSG allow rules

The following tables describe how to configure a collection of NSG allow rules.
>[!NOTE]
> The subnet associated with a Container App Environment on the Consumption only environment requires a CIDR prefix of `/23` or larger. On the workload profiles environment (preview), a `/27` or larger is required.

### Inbound

| Protocol | Port | ServiceTag | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| Any | \* | Infrastructure subnet address space | Allow communication between IPs in the infrastructure subnet. This address is passed as a parameter when you create an environment. For example, `10.0.0.0/21`. |
| Any | \* | AzureLoadBalancer | Allow the Azure infrastructure load balancer to communicate with your environment. |

### Outbound with service tags

The following service tags are required when using NSGs on the Consumption only environment:

| Protocol | Port | ServiceTag | Description
|--|--|--|--|
| UDP | `1194` | `AzureCloud.<REGION>` | Required for internal AKS secure connection between underlying nodes and control plane. Replace `<REGION>` with the region where your container app is deployed. |
| TCP | `9000` | `AzureCloud.<REGION>` | Required for internal AKS secure connection between underlying nodes and control plane. Replace `<REGION>` with the region where your container app is deployed. |
| TCP | `443` | `AzureMonitor` | Allows outbound calls to Azure Monitor. |

The following service tags are required when using NSGs on the workload profiles environment:

>[!Note]
> If you are using Azure Container Registry (ACR) with NSGs configured on your virtual network, create a private endpoint on your ACR to allow Container Apps to pull images through the virtual network.

| Protocol | Port | Service Tag | Description
|--|--|--|--|
| TCP | `443` | `MicrosoftContainerRegistry` | This is the service tag for container registry for microsoft containers. |
| TCP | `443` | `AzureFrontDoor.FirstParty` | This is a dependency of the `MicrosoftContainerRegistry` service tag. |

### Outbound with wild card IP rules

The following IP rules are required when using NSGs on both the Consumption only environment and the workload profiles environment:

| Protocol | Port | IP | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| TCP | `443` | \* | Allowing all outbound on port `443` provides a way to allow all FQDN based outbound dependencies that don't have a static IP. |
| UDP | `123` | \* | NTP server. |
| TCP | `5671` | \* | Container Apps control plane. |
| TCP | `5672` | \* | Container Apps control plane. |
| Any | \* | Infrastructure subnet address space | Allow communication between IPs in the infrastructure subnet. This address is passed as a parameter when you create an environment. For example, `10.0.0.0/21`. |

#### Considerations

- If you're running HTTP servers, you might need to add ports `80` and `443`.
- Adding deny rules for some ports and protocols with lower priority than `65000` may cause service interruption and unexpected behavior.
- Don't explicitly deny the Azure DNS address `168.63.128.16` in the outgoing NSG rules, or your Container Apps environment won't be able to function.
