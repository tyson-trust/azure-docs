# Connect to services in Azure Container Apps (preview)

As you develop applications in Azure Container Apps, you often need to connect to different services.

Rather than creating services ahead of time and manually connecting them to your container app, you can quickly create instances of development-grade services that are designed for nonproduction environments known as "dev services".

Dev services allow you to use OSS services without the burden of manual downloads, creation, and configuration.

Services available as dev services include:

- Open-source Redis
- Open-source PostgreSQL

Once you're ready for your app to use a production level service, you can connect your application to an Azure managed service.

## Features

dev services come with the following features:

- **Scope**: The service runs in the same environment as the connected container app.
- **Scaling**: The service can scale in to zero when there's no demand for the service.
- **Pricing**: Service billing falls under consumption-based pricing. Billing only happens when instances of the service are running.
- **Storage**: The service uses persistent storage to ensure there's no data loss as a service scales in to zero.
- **Revisions**: Anytime you change a dev service, a new revision of your container app is created.

See the service-specific features for managed services.

## Binding

Both dev mode and managed services connect to a container via a "binding".

The Container Apps runtime binds a container app to a service by:

- Discovering the service
- Extracting networking and connection configuration values
- Injecting configuration and connection information into container app environment variables

Once a binding is established, the container app can read these configuration and connection values from environment variables.

## Development vs production

As you move from development to production, you can move from a dev service to a managed service.

The following table shows you which service to use in development, and which service to use in production.

| Functionality | dev service | Production managed service |
|---|---|---|
| Cache | Open-source Redis | Azure Cache for Redis |
| Database | N/A | Azure Cosmos DB |
| Database | Open-source PostgreSQL | Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server |

You're responsible for data continuity between development and production environments.

## Manage a service

To connect a service to an application, you first need to create the service.

Use the `service` command with `containerapp create` to create a new service.

``` CLI
az containerapp service redis create \
  --name myredis \
  --environment myenv
```

This command creates a new Redis service called `myredis` in a Container Apps environment called `myenv`.

To bind a service to an application, use the `--bind` argument for `containerapp create`.

``` CLI
az containerapp create \
  --name myapp \
  --image myimage \
  --bind myredis \
  --environment myenv
```

This command features the typical Container App `create` with the `--bind` argument. The bind argument tells the Container Apps runtime to connect a service to the application.

The `--bind` argument is available to the `create` or `update` commands.

To disconnect a service from an application, use the `--unbind` argument on the
`update` command

The following example shows you how to unbind a service.

``` CLI
az containerapp update --name myapp --unbind myredis
```

For a full tutorial on connecting to services, see [Connect services in Azure Container Apps](connect-services.md).

For more information on the service commands and arguments, see the
[`az containerapp`](/cli/azure/containerapp?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true) reference.

## Limitations

- dev services are in public preview.
- Any container app created before May 23, 2023 isn't eligible to use dev services.
- dev services come with minimal guarantees. For instance, they're automatically restarted if they crash, however there's no formal quality of service or high-availability guarantees associated with them. For production workloads, use Azure-managed services.
