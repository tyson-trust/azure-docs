# Application Logging in Azure Container Apps

Azure Container Apps provides two types of application logging categories:

- [Container console logs](#container-console-logs): Log streams from your container console.
- [System logs](#system-logs): Logs generated by the Azure Container Apps service.

You can view the [log streams](log-streaming.md) in near real-time in the Azure portal or CLI. For more options to store and monitor your logs, see [Logging options](log-options.md).

## Container console Logs

Container Apps captures the `stdout` and `stderr` output streams from your application containers and displays them as console logs. When you implement logging in your application, you can troubleshoot problems and monitor the health of your app.  

## System logs

Container Apps generates system logs to inform you of the status of service level events.  Log messages include the following information:

- Successfully created dapr component
- Successfully updated dapr component
- Error creating dapr component
- Successfully mounted volume
- Error mounting volume
- Successfully bound Domain
- Auth enabled on app
- Creating authentication config
- Auth config created successfully
- Setting a traffic weight
- Creating a new revision:
- Successfully provisioned revision
- Deactivating Old revisions
- Error provisioning revision
