Refer to the following samples to learn how to use Azure Container Apps in different contexts and paired with different technologies.

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| [A/B Testing your ASP.NET Core apps using Azure Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotNET-Frontend-AB-Testing-on-Azure-Container-Apps)<br /> | Shows how to use Azure App Configuration, ASP.NET Core Feature Flags, and Azure Container Apps revisions together to gradually release features or perform A/B tests. |
| [gRPC with ASP.NET Core on Azure Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotNET-Workers-with-gRPC-messaging-on-Azure-Container-Apps) | This repository contains a simple scenario built to demonstrate how ASP.NET Core 6.0 can be used to build a cloud-native application hosted in Azure Container Apps that uses gRPC request/response transmission from Worker microservices. The gRPC service simultaneously streams sensor data to a Blazor server frontend, so you can watch the data be charted in real-time. |
| [Deploy an Orleans Cluster to Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Orleans-Cluster-on-Azure-Container-Apps) | An end-to-end sample and tutorial for getting a Microsoft Orleans cluster running on Azure Container Apps. Worker microservices rapidly transmit data to a back-end Orleans cluster for monitoring and storage, emulating thousands of physical devices in the field. |
| [Deploy a shopping cart Orleans app to Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/orleans-blazor-server-shopping-cart-on-container-apps) | An end-to-end example shopping cart app built in ASP.NET Core Blazor Server with Orleans deployed to Azure Container Apps. |
| [ASP.NET Core front-end with two back-end APIs on Azure Container Apps](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotNET-FrontEnd-to-BackEnd-on-Azure-Container-Apps )<br /> | This sample demonstrates ASP.NET Core 6.0 can be used to build a cloud-native application hosted in Azure Container Apps. |
| [ASP.NET Core front-end with two back-end APIs on Azure Container Apps (with Dapr)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotNET-FrontEnd-to-BackEnd-with-DAPR-on-Azure-Container-Apps )<br /> | Demonstrates how ASP.NET Core 6.0 is used to build a cloud-native application hosted in Azure Container Apps using Dapr. |
