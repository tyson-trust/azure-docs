# Application lifecycle management in Azure Container Apps

The Azure Container Apps application lifecycle revolves around [revisions](revisions.md).

When you deploy a container app, the first revision is automatically created. [More revisions are created](revisions.md) as [containers](containers.md) change, or any adjustments are made to the `template` section of the configuration.

A container app flows through four phases: deployment, update, deactivation, and shut down.

## Deployment

As a container app is deployed, the first revision is automatically created.

## Update

As a container app is updated with a [revision scope-change](revisions.md#revision-scope-changes), a new revision is created. You can [choose](revisions.md#revision-modes) whether to automatically deactivate old revisions (single revision mode), or allow them to remain available (multiple revision mode).

### Zero downtime deployment

In single revision mode, Container Apps automatically ensures your app doesn't experience downtime when creating a new revision. The existing active revision isn't deactivated until the new revision is ready. If ingress is enabled, the existing revision continues to receive 100% of the traffic until the new revision is ready.

> [!NOTE]
> A new revision is considered ready when one of its replicas starts and becomes ready. A replica is ready when all of its containers start and pass their [startup and readiness probes](./health-probes.md).

In multiple revision mode, you control when revisions are activated or deactivated and which revisions receive ingress traffic. If a [traffic splitting rule](./revisions-manage.md#traffic-splitting) is configured with `latestRevision` set to `true`, traffic doesn't switch to the latest revision until it's ready.

## Deactivate

Once a revision is no longer needed, you can deactivate a revision with the option to reactivate later. During deactivation, containers in the revision are [shut down](#shutdown).

## Shutdown

The containers are shut down in the following situations:

- As a container app scales in
- As a container app is being deleted
- As a revision is being deactivated

When a shutdown is initiated, the container host sends a [SIGTERM message](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) to your container. The code implemented in the container can respond to this operating system-level message to handle termination.

If your application doesn't respond within 30 seconds to the `SIGTERM` message, then [SIGKILL](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(IPC)) terminates your container.

Additionally, make sure your application can gracefully handle shutdowns. Containers restart regularly, so don't expect state to persist inside a container. Instead, use external caches for expensive in-memory cache requirements.
