# Gateway IP addresses

The table below lists the individual Gateway IP addresses and also Gateway IP address ranges per region.

Periodically, we will retire Gateways using old hardware and migrate the traffic to new Gateways as per the process outlined at [Azure SQL Database traffic migration to newer Gateways](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/gateway-migration?view=azuresql&tabs=in-progress-ip). We strongly encourage customers to use the **Gateway IP address subnets** in order to not be impacted by this activity in a region.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - Logins for SQL Database or dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse can land on **any of the Gateways in a region**. For consistent connectivity to SQL Database or dedicated SQL pools (formerly SQL DW) in Azure Synapse, allow network traffic to and from **ALL** Gateway IP addresses and Gateway IP address subnets for the region.
> - Use the Gateway IP addresses in this section if you're using a Proxy connection policy to connect to Azure SQL Database. If you're using the Redirect connection policy, refer to the [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags - Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519) for a list of your region's IP addresses to allow.
