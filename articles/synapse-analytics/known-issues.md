## Azure Synapse Analytics serverless SQL pool active known issues summary

### Queries using Azure AD authentication fails after 1 hour

SQL connections using Azure AD authentication that remain active for more than 1 hour will start to fail. This includes querying storage using Azure AD pass-through authentication and statements that interact with Azure AD, like CREATE EXTERNAL PROVIDER. This affects every tool that keeps connections active, like query editor in SSMS and ADS. Tools that open new connection to execute queries aren't affected, like Synapse Studio.

**Workaround**: The engineering team is currently aware of this behavior and working on a fix. <br>
Following steps can be followed to work around the problem. 

1) It's recommended switching to Service Principal, Managed Identity or Shared Access Signature instead of using user identity for long running queries. 
2) Restarting client (SSMS/ADS) acquires new token to establish the connection.

### Query failures from serverless SQL pool to Azure Cosmos DB analytical store

Queries from a serverless SQL pool to Azure Cosmos DB analytical store might fail with one of the following error messages:

- `Resolving CosmosDB path has failed with error 'This request is not authorized to perform this operation'`
- `Resolving CosmosDB path has failed with error 'Key not found'`

The following conditions must be true to confirm this issue:

1) The connection to Azure Cosmos DB analytical store uses a private endpoint. 
2) Retrying the query succeeds.

**Workaround**: The engineering team is aware of this behavior and following actions can be taken as quick mitigation:

1) Retry the failed query. It will automatically refresh the expired token.
2) Disable the private endpoint. Before applying this change, confirm with your security team that it meets your company security policies.

### Azure Cosmos DB analytical store view propagates wrong attributes in the column

While using views in Azure Synapse serverless pool over Cosmos DB analytical store, If there is a change on files in the Cosmos DB analytical store, the change does not get propagated correctly to the SELECT statements, the customer is using on the view. As a result of that, the attributes get incorrectly mapped to a different column in the results.

**Workaround**: The engineering team is aware of this behavior and following actions can be taken as quick mitigation:

1) Recreate the view by renaming the columns.
2) Avoid using views if possible.

### Alter database-scoped credential fails if credential has been used

Sometimes you may not be able to execute the ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL query. The root cause of this issue is the credential was cached after its first use making it inaccessible for alteration. The error returned in such case is following "Failed to modify the identity field of the credential '{credential_name}' because the credential is used by an active database file.".

**Workaround**: The engineering team is currently aware of this behavior and is working on a fix. As a workaround you can DROP and CREATE the credentials, which would also mean recreating external tables using the credentials. Alternatively, you can engage Microsoft Support Team for assistance.

## Azure Synapse Analytics Dedicated SQL pool active known issues summary

### Queries failing with Data Exfiltration Error

Synapse workspaces created from an existing dedicated SQL Pool report query failures related to [Data Exfiltration Protection](security/workspace-data-exfiltration-protection.md) with generic error message while Data Exfiltration Protection is turned off in Synapse Analytics: 

`Data exfiltration to '{****}' is blocked. Add destination to allowed list for data exfiltration and try again.`

**Workaround**: If you encountered a similar error, engage Microsoft Support Team for assistance.

## Azure Synapse workspace active known issues summary

The following are known issues with the Synapse workspace.

### Blob storage linked service with User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) is not getting listed

The linked service may not be visible under the **Data Hub** -> **Linked** -> **Azure Blob Storage** after configuring the blob storage linked service to use "User Assigned Managed Identity" authentication in Azure Synapse Analytics.

**Workaround**: The engineering team is currently aware of this behavior and working on a fix. As an alternative, use "System Assigned Managed Identity" authentication method instead of "User Assigned Managed Identity".

### Failed to delete Synapse workspace & Unable to delete virtual network

Deleting a Synapse workspace fails with the error message:

`Failed to delete Synapse workspace '[Workspace Name]'. Unable to delete virtual network. The correlationId is ********-****-****-****-************;`

**Workaround**: The problem can be mitigated by retrying the delete operation. The engineering team is aware of this behavior and working on a fix.
