# Data types in Bicep

This article describes the data types supported in [Bicep](./overview.md). [User-defined data types](./user-defined-data-types.md) are currently in preview.

## Supported types

Within a Bicep, you can use these data types:

* [array](#arrays)
* [bool](#booleans)
* [int](#integers)
* [object](#objects)
* [secureObject - indicated by decorator in Bicep](#secure-strings-and-objects)
* [secureString - indicated by decorator     in Bicep](#secure-strings-and-objects)
* [string](#strings)

## Arrays

Arrays start with a left bracket (`[`) and end with a right bracket (`]`). In Bicep, an array can be declared in single line or multiple lines. Commas (`,`) are used between values in single-line declarations, but not used in multiple-line declarations,  You can mix and match single-line and multiple-line declarations. The multiple-line declaration requires **Bicep version 0.7.4 or later**.

```bicep
var multiLineArray = [
  'abc'
  'def'
  'ghi'
]

var singleLineArray = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']

var mixedArray = ['abc', 'def'
    'ghi']
```

In an array, each item is represented by the [any type](bicep-functions-any.md). You can have an array where each item is the same data type, or an array that holds different data types.

The following example shows an array of integers and an array different types.

```bicep
var integerArray = [
  1
  2
  3
]

var mixedArray = [
  resourceGroup().name
  1
  true
  'example string'
]
```

Arrays in Bicep are zero-based. In the following example, the expression `exampleArray[0]` evaluates to 1 and `exampleArray[2]` evaluates to 3. The index of the indexer may itself be another expression. The expression `exampleArray[index]` evaluates to 2. Integer indexers are only allowed on expression of array types.

```bicep
var index = 1

var exampleArray = [
  1
  2
  3
]
```

You get the following error when the index is out of bounds:

```error
The language expression property array index 'x' is out of bounds
```

To avoid this exception, you can use the [Or logical operator](./operators-logical.md#or-) as shown in the following example:

```bicep
param emptyArray array = []
param numberArray array = [1, 2, 3]

output foo bool = empty(emptyArray) || emptyArray[0] == 'bar'
output bar bool = length(numberArray) >= 3 || numberArray[3] == 4
```

## Booleans

When specifying boolean values, use `true` or `false`. Don't surround the value with quotation marks.

```bicep
param exampleBool bool = true
```

## Integers

When specifying integer values, don't use quotation marks.

```bicep
param exampleInt int = 1
```

In Bicep, integers are 64-bit integers. When passed as inline parameters, the range of values may be limited by the SDK or command-line tool you use for deployment. For example, when using PowerShell to deploy a Bicep, integer types can range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. To avoid this limitation, specify large integer values in a [parameter file](parameter-files.md). Resource types apply their own limits for integer properties.

Floating point, decimal or binary formats aren't currently supported.

## Objects

Objects start with a left brace (`{`) and end with a right brace (`}`). In Bicep, an object can be declared in single line or multiple lines. Each property in an object consists of key and value. The key and value are separated by a colon (`:`). An object allows any property of any type. Commas (`,`) are used between properties for single-line declarations, but not used between properties for multiple-line declarations. You can mix and match single-line and multiple-line declarations. The multiple-line declaration requires **Bicep version 0.7.4 or later**.

```bicep
param singleLineObject object = {name: 'test name', id: '123-abc', isCurrent: true, tier: 1}

param multiLineObject object = {
  name: 'test name'
  id: '123-abc'
  isCurrent: true
  tier: 1
}

param mixedObject object = {name: 'test name', id: '123-abc', isCurrent: true
    tier: 1}
```

In Bicep, quotes are optionally allowed on object property keys:

```bicep
var test = {
  'my - special. key': 'value'
}
```

In the preceding example, quotes are used when the object property keys contain special characters.  For example space, '-', or '.'. The following example shows how to use interpolation in object property keys.

```bicep
var stringVar = 'example value'
var objectVar = {
  '${stringVar}': 'this value'
}
```

Property accessors are used to access properties of an object. They're constructed using the `.` operator.

```bicep
var a = {
  b: 'Dev'
  c: 42
  d: {
    e: true
  }
}

output result1 string = a.b // returns 'Dev'
output result2 int = a.c // returns 42
output result3 bool = a.d.e // returns true
```

Property accessors can be used with any object, including parameters and variables of object types and object literals. Using a property accessor on an expression of non-object type is an error.

You can also use the `[]` syntax to access a property. The following example returns `Development`.

```bicep
var environmentSettings = {
  dev: {
    name: 'Development'
  }
  prod: {
    name: 'Production'
  }
}

output accessorResult string = environmentSettings['dev'].name
```

[!INCLUDE [JSON object ordering](../../../includes/resource-manager-object-ordering-bicep.md)]

You will get the following error when accessing an nonexisting property of an object:

```error
The language expression property 'foo' doesn't exist
```

To avoid the exception, you can use the [And logical operator](./operators-logical.md#and-) as shown in the following example:

```bicep
param objectToTest object = {
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
}

output bar bool = contains(objectToTest, 'four') && objectToTest.four == 4
```

## Strings

In Bicep, strings are marked with singled quotes, and must be declared on a single line. All Unicode characters with code points between *0* and *10FFFF* are allowed.

```bicep
param exampleString string = 'test value'
```

The following table lists the set of reserved characters that must be escaped by a backslash (`\`) character:

| Escape Sequence | Represented value | Notes |
|:-|:-|:-|
| `\\` | `\` ||
| `\'` | `'` ||
| `\n` | line feed (LF) ||
| `\r` | carriage return (CR) ||
| `\t` | tab character ||
| `\u{x}` | Unicode code point `x` | **x** represents a hexadecimal code point value between *0* and *10FFFF* (both inclusive). Leading zeros are allowed. Code points above *FFFF* are emitted as a surrogate pair.
| `\$` | `$` | Only escape when followed by `{`. |

```bicep
// evaluates to "what's up?"
var myVar = 'what\'s up?'
```

All strings in Bicep support interpolation. To inject an expression, surround it by `${` and `}`. Expressions that are referenced can't span multiple lines.

```bicep
var storageName = 'storage${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}'
```

## Multi-line strings

In Bicep, multi-line strings are defined between three single quote characters (`'''`) followed optionally by a newline (the opening sequence), and three single quote characters (`'''` - the closing sequence). Characters that are entered between the opening and closing sequence are read verbatim, and no escaping is necessary or possible.

> [!NOTE]
> Because the Bicep parser reads all characters as is, depending on the line endings of your Bicep file, newlines can be interpreted as either `\r\n` or `\n`.
>
> Interpolation is not currently supported in multi-line strings. Due to this limitation, you may need to use the [`concat`](./bicep-functions-string.md#concat) function instead of use [interpolation](#strings).
>
> Multi-line strings containing `'''` are not supported.

```bicep
// evaluates to "hello!"
var myVar = '''hello!'''

// evaluates to "hello!" because the first newline is skipped
var myVar2 = '''
hello!'''

// evaluates to "hello!\n" because the final newline is included
var myVar3 = '''
hello!
'''

// evaluates to "  this\n    is\n      indented\n"
var myVar4 = '''
  this
    is
      indented
'''

// evaluates to "comments // are included\n/* because everything is read as-is */\n"
var myVar5 = '''
comments // are included
/* because everything is read as-is */
'''

// evaluates to "interpolation\nis ${blocked}"
// note ${blocked} is part of the string, and is not evaluated as an expression
var myVar6 = '''interpolation
is ${blocked}'''
```

## Secure strings and objects

Secure string uses the same format as string, and secure object uses the same format as object. With Bicep, you add the `@secure()` [decorator](./parameters.md#decorators) to a string or object.

When you set a parameter to a secure string or secure object, the value of the parameter isn't saved to the deployment history and isn't logged. However, if you set that secure value to a property that isn't expecting a secure value, the value isn't protected. For example, if you set a secure string to a tag, that value is stored as plain text. Use secure strings for passwords and secrets.

The following example shows two secure parameters:

```bicep
@secure()
param password string

@secure()
param configValues object
```

## Data type assignability

In Bicep, a value of one type (source type) can be assigned to another type (target type). The following table shows which source type (listed horizontally) can or can't be assigned to which target type (listed vertically). In the table, `X` means assignable, empty space means not assignable, and `?` means only if they types are compatible.

| Types | `any` | `error` | `string` | `number` | `int` | `bool` | `null` | `object` | `array` | named resource | named module | `scope` |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| `any`          |X| |X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|X|
| `error`        | | | | | | | | | | | | |
| `string`       |X| |X| | | | | | | | | |
| `number`       |X| | |X|X| | | | | | | |
| `int`          |X| | | |X| | | | | | | |
| `bool`         |X| | | | |X| | | | | | |
| `null`         |X| | | | | |X| | | | | |
| `object`       |X| | | | | | |X| | | | |
| `array`        |X| | | | | | | |X| | | |
| `resource`     |X| | | | | | | | |X| | |
| `module`       |X| | | | | | | | | |X| |
| `scope`        | | | | | | | | | | | |?|
| **named resource** |X| | | | | | |?| |?| | |
| **named module**   |X| | | | | | |?| | |?| |
