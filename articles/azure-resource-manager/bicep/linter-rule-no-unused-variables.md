# Linter rule - no unused variables

This rule finds variables that aren't referenced anywhere in the Bicep file.

## Linter rule code

Use the following value in the [Bicep configuration file](bicep-config-linter.md) to customize rule settings:

`no-unused-vars`

## Solution

To reduce confusion in your template, delete any variables that are defined but not used. This test finds any variables that aren't used anywhere in the template.

You can use **Quick Fix** to remove the unused variables:
