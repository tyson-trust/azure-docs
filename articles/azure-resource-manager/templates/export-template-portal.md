## Export template from a resource group

To export one or more resources from a resource group:

1. Select the resource group that contains the resources you want to export.

1. Select one or more resources by selecting the checkboxes.  To select all, select the checkbox on the left of **Name**. The **Export template** menu item only becomes enabled after you've selected at least one resource.

    On the screenshot, only the storage account is selected.
1. Select **Export template**.

1. The exported template is displayed, and is available to download and deploy.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/export-template-portal/show-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the displayed exported template in Azure portal.":::

   **Include parameters** is selected by default.  When selected, all template parameters will be included when the template is generated. If you’d like to author your own parameters, toggle this checkbox to not include them.

## Export template from a resource

To export one resource:

1. Select the resource group containing the resource you want to export.

1. Select the resource that you want to export to open the resource.

1. For that resource, select **Export template** in the left pane.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/export-template-portal/export-single-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot of exporting a single resource in Azure portal.":::

1. The exported template is displayed, and is available to download and deploy. The template only contains the single resource. **Include parameters** is selected by default.  When selected, all template parameters will be included when the template is generated. If you’d like to author your own parameters, toggle this checkbox to not include them.

## Download template before deployment

The portal has the option of downloading a template before deploying it. This option isn't available through PowerShell or Azure CLI.

1. Select the Azure service you want to deploy.

1. Fill in the values for the new service.

1. After passing validation, but before starting the deployment, select **Download a template for automation**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/export-template-portal/download-before-deployment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the option to download a template before deployment in Azure portal.":::

1. The template is displayed and is available for download and deploy.

## Export template after deployment

You can export the template that was used to deploy existing resources. The template you get is exactly the one that was used for deployment.

1. Select the resource group you want to export.

1. Select the link under **Deployments**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/export-template-portal/select-deployment-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting deployment history in Azure portal.":::

1. Select one of the deployments from the deployment history.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/export-template-portal/select-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a specific deployment from deployment history in Azure portal.":::

1. Select **Template**. The template used for this deployment is displayed, and is available for download.
