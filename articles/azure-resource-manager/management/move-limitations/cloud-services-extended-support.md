# Move guidance for Cloud Services (extended support) deployment model resources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The move feature is under development for Cloud Services (extended support) and not available for Production use yet. The guidance will be updated once the feature is deployed for all customers and regions.

The steps to move resources deployed through the Cloud Services (extended support) model differ based on whether you're moving the resources within a subscription or to a new subscription.

## Move in the same subscription

When moving Cloud Services (extended support) resources from one resource group to another resource group within the same subscription, the following restrictions apply:

- Cloud Service must not be in manual mode
- Cloud Service must not be VIP Swappable
- Cloud Service must not have any pending operations
- Cloud Service must not be in migration
- Cloud Service must not be in failed state
- Ensure the Cloud Service has an unexpired SAS blob URI pointing to the cloud service package

> [!NOTE]
> Cloud Services and associated networking resources (for example, PublicIPs and network security groups) can be move independently. Load balancers must always exist in the same resource group

To move classic resources to a new resource group within the same subscription, use the [standard move operations](../move-resource-group-and-subscription.md) through the portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or REST API. You use the same operations as you use for moving Resource Manager resources.

## Move across subscriptions

When moving Cloud Services (extended support) deployments to a new subscription, the following restrictions apply:

- When performing a cross subscription move, all associated cloud service resources such key vault and network resources must move together.
- If faced with a Move Resource operation error saying that the cloud service can't be moved because of a prior failed operation, create a ticket to resolve the issue. 
- Cloud Service must not have any cross-subscription references.
