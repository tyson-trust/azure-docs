# Use labs for trainings

In this article, you learn about the different features and steps for using Azure Lab Services for conducting classes. Azure Lab Services allows educators (teachers, professors, trainers, or teaching assistants, etc.) to quickly and easily create an online lab to provision preconfigured learning environments for the trainees. Each trainee can use identical and isolated environments for the training. Apply policies to ensure that the training environments are available to each trainee only when they need them, and contain enough resources - such as virtual machines - required for the training.

Labs meet the following requirements for conducting training in any virtual environment:

- Trainees can quickly provision their training environments
- Every training machine should be identical
- Trainees can't see VMs created by other trainees
- Control cost by ensuring that trainees can't get more VMs than they need for the training and also shutdown VMs when they aren't using them
- Easily share the training lab with each trainee
- Reuse the training lab again and again

## Mapping organizational roles to permissions

Azure Lab Services uses Azure Role-Based Access (Azure RBAC) to manage access to Azure Lab Services. For more information, see the [Azure Lab Services built-in roles](./administrator-guide.md#rbac-roles). Using Azure RBAC lets you clearly separate roles and responsibilities for creating and managing labs across different teams and people in your organization.

Depending on your organizational structure, responsibilities, and skill level, there might be different options to map these permissions to your organizational roles or personas, such as administrators, or educators. The scenarios and diagrams also include students to show where they fit in the process, although they don't require Azure AD permissions.

The following sections give different examples of assigning permissions across an organization. Azure Lab Services enables you to flexibly assign permissions beyond these typical scenarios to match your organizational setup.

### Scenario 1: Splitting responsibilities between IT department and educators

In this scenario, the IT department, service providers, or administrators manage the Azure subscription(s). They're responsible for creating the Azure Lab Services lab plan and then grant the educators permission to create labs in the lab plan. The educator invites students to register for and connect to a lab VM.

In your organization structure, the administrator activities might be further split across subteams. For example, one team might be responsible for the configuration of virtual networks for advanced networking (central IT). And the creation of the lab plan and other Azure resources might be the responsibility of another team (department IT).

Get started as an administrator with the [Quickstart: set up the resources for creating labs](./quick-create-resources.md).

Get started as an educator with the [Tutorial: set up a lab for classroom training](./tutorial-setup-lab.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/classroom-labs-scenarios/lab-services-process-education-roles-scenario1.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows lab creation steps where admins create the lab plan and educators create the lab.":::

The following table shows the corresponding mapping of organization roles to Azure AD roles:

| Org. role | Azure AD role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Administrator | - Subscription Owner<br/>- Subscription Contributor | Create lab plan in Azure portal. |
|               | Lab Operator | Optionally, assign to other administrator to manage lab users & schedules, publish labs, and reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
| Educator      | Lab Creator | Create and manage the labs they created. |
|               | Lab Contributor | Optionally, assign to an educator to create and manage all labs (when assigned at the resource group level). |
|               | Lab Operator | Optionally, assign to other educators to manage lab users & schedules, publish labs, and reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
|               | Lab Assistant | Optionally, assign to other educators to help support lab students by allowing reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
| Student       |  | Students don't need an Azure AD role. Educators [grant students access](./how-to-manage-lab-users.md) in the lab configuration or students are automatically granted access, for example when using [Teams](./how-to-manage-labs-within-teams.md#manage-lab-user-lists-in-teams) or [Canvas](./how-to-manage-labs-within-canvas.md#manage-lab-user-lists-in-canvas). |
| Others        | Lab Services Reader | Optionally, provide access to see all lab plans and labs without permission to modify. |

### Scenario 2: The IT department owns the entire lab creation process

In this scenario, the IT department (administrators) creates both the Azure Lab Services lab plan and lab. Optionally, the administrator grants educators permissions to manage lab users and configure lab settings, such as quotas and schedules. This scenario might be useful in cases where educators can't or don't want to set up and customize the lab.

As mentioned in [scenario 1](#scenario-1-splitting-responsibilities-between-it-department-and-educators), the administrator tasks for creating the lab plan might also be split across multiple subteams.

Get started as an administrator with the [Quickstart: create and connect to a lab](./quick-create-connect-lab.md).

Get started as an educator and [add students to a lab](./how-to-manage-lab-users.md), or [create a lab schedule](./how-to-create-schedules.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/classroom-labs-scenarios/lab-services-process-education-roles-scenario2.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows lab creation steps where admins own the entire process.":::

The following table shows the corresponding mapping of organization roles to Azure AD roles:

| Org. role | Azure AD role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Administrator | - Subscription Owner<br/>- Subscription Contributor | Create lab plan in Azure portal. |
|               | Lab Operator | Optionally, assign to other administrator to manage lab users & schedules, publish labs, and reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
| Educator      | Lab Operator | Manage lab users & schedules, publish labs, and reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
|               | Lab Assistant | Optionally, assign to other educators to help support lab students by allowing reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
| Student       |  | Students don't need an Azure AD role. Educators [grant students access](./how-to-manage-lab-users.md) in the lab configuration or students are automatically granted access, for example when using [Teams](./how-to-manage-labs-within-teams.md#manage-lab-user-lists-in-teams) or [Canvas](./how-to-manage-labs-within-canvas.md#manage-lab-user-lists-in-canvas). |
| Others        | Lab Services Reader | Optionally, provide access to see all lab plans and labs without permission to modify. |

### Scenario 3: The educator owns the entire lab creation process

In this scenario, the educator manages their Azure subscription and manages the entire process of creating the Azure Lab Services lab plan and lab. This scenario might be useful in cases where educators are comfortable with creating Azure resources, and creating and customizing labs.

Get started as an administrator with the [Quickstart: create and connect to a lab](./quick-create-connect-lab.md) and then [add students to a lab](./how-to-manage-lab-users.md), and [create a lab schedule](./how-to-create-schedules.md).

:::image type="content" source="./media/classroom-labs-scenarios/lab-services-process-education-roles-scenario3.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows lab creation steps where educators own the entire process.":::

The following table shows the corresponding mapping of organization roles to Azure AD roles:

| Org. role | Azure AD role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Educator      | - Subscription Owner<br/>- Subscription Contributor | Create lab plan in Azure portal. As an Owner, you can also fully manage all labs.  |
|               | Lab Assistant | Optionally, assign to other educators to help support lab students by allowing reset/start/stop/connect lab VMs. |
| Student       |  | Students don't need an Azure AD role. Educators [grant students access](./how-to-manage-lab-users.md) in the lab configuration or students are automatically granted access, for example when using [Teams](./how-to-manage-labs-within-teams.md#manage-lab-user-lists-in-teams) or [Canvas](./how-to-manage-labs-within-canvas.md#manage-lab-user-lists-in-canvas). |
| Others        | Lab Services Reader | Optionally, provide access to see all lab plans and labs without permission to modify. |
