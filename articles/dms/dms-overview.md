# What is Azure Database Migration Service?

Azure Database Migration Service is a fully managed service designed to enable seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime (online migrations).

With Azure Database Migration Service currently we offer two options:

1. [Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio](./migration-using-azure-data-studio.md)
1. Database Migration Service (classic) - via Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI.

**Azure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio** is powered by the latest version of Database Migration Service and provides more features. Currently, it supports SQL Database modernization to Azure. For improved functionality and supportability, consider migrating to Azure SQL Database by using the Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio.

**Database Migration Service (classic)** via Azure portal, PowerShell and Azure CLI is an older version of the Azure Database Migration Service. It offers database modernization to Azure and support scenarios like – SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

## Compare versions

Consider using the [Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio](./migration-using-azure-data-studio.md) whenever possible.

## Migrate databases to Azure with familiar tools

Azure Database Migration Service integrates some of the functionality of our existing tools and services. It provides customers with a comprehensive, highly available solution. The service uses the [Data Migration Assistant](/sql/dma/dma-overview) to generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to guide you through the required changes before a migration. It's up to you to perform any remediation required. Azure Database Migration Service performs all the required steps when ready to begin the migration process. Knowing that the process takes advantage of Microsoft's best practices, you can fire and forget your migration projects with peace of mind.
