# Tutorial: Migrate SQL Server to Azure SQL Database offline in Azure Data Studio

You can use Azure Database Migration Service and the Azure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio to migrate databases from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to Azure SQL Database offline and with minimal downtime.

In this tutorial, learn how to migrate the example AdventureWorks2019 database from an on-premises instance of SQL Server to an instance of Azure SQL Database by using the Azure SQL Migration extension for Azure Data Studio. This tutorial uses offline migration mode, which considers an acceptable downtime during the migration process.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Open the Migrate to Azure SQL wizard in Azure Data Studio
> - Run an assessment of your source SQL Server databases
> - Collect performance data from your source SQL Server instance
> - Get a recommendation of the Azure SQL Database SKU that will work best for your workload
> - Deploy your on-premises database schema to Azure SQL Database
> - Create an instance of Azure Database Migration Service
> - Start your migration and monitor progress to completion

[!INCLUDE [online-offline](../../includes/database-migration-service-offline-online.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, *online* migrations for Azure SQL Database targets aren't available.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the tutorial:

- [Download and install Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio).
- [Install the Azure SQL Migration extension](/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/azure-sql-migration-extension) from Azure Data Studio Marketplace.
- Have an Azure account that's assigned to one of the following built-in roles:

  - Contributor for the target instance of Azure SQL Database
  - Reader role for the Azure resource group that contains the target instance of Azure SQL Database
  - Owner or Contributor role for the Azure subscription (required if you create a new instance of Azure Database Migration Service)
  
  As an alternative to using one of these built-in roles, you can [assign a custom role](resource-custom-roles-sql-database-ads.md).
  
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > An Azure account is required only when you configure the migration steps. An Azure account isn't required for the assessment or to view Azure recommendations in the migration wizard in Azure Data Studio.

- Create a target instance of [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart).

- Make sure that the SQL Server login that connects to the source SQL Server instance is a member of the db_datareader role and that the login for the target SQL Server instance is a member of the db_owner role.

- Migrate the database schema from source to target by using the [SQL Server dacpac extension](/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/sql-server-dacpac-extension) or the [SQL Database Projects extension](/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/sql-database-project-extension) in Azure Data Studio.

- If you're using Azure Database Migration Service for the first time, make sure that the Microsoft.DataMigration [resource provider is registered in your subscription](quickstart-create-data-migration-service-portal.md#register-the-resource-provider).

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to migrate the database schema from source to target by using the [SQL Server dacpac extension](/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/sql-server-dacpac-extension) or the [SQL Database Projects extension](/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/sql-database-project-extension) in Azure Data Studio before selecting the list of tables to migrate.
>
> If no tables exists on the Azure SQL Database target, or no tables are selected before starting the migration. The **Next** button isn't available to select to initiate the migration task.
>

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/summary-start-migration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows start migration.":::

## Monitor the database migration

1. In Azure Data Studio, in the server menu under **General**, select **Azure SQL Migration** to go to the dashboard for your Azure SQL Database migrations.

   Under **Database migration status**, you can track migrations that are in progress, completed, and failed (if any), or you can view all database migrations.  

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows monitor migration dashboard." lightbox="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard.png":::

1. Select **Database migrations in progress** to view active migrations.

   To get more information about a specific migration, select the database name.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows database migration details." lightbox="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard-details.png":::

   Database Migration Service returns the latest known migration status each time migration status refreshes. The following table describes possible statuses:

    | Status | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    |Preparing for copy| The service is disabling autostats, triggers, and indexes in the target table. |
    |Copying| Data is being copied from the source database to the target database. |
    |Copy finished| Data copy is finished. The service is waiting on other tables to finish copying to begin the final steps to return tables to their original schema. |
    |Rebuilding indexes| The service is rebuilding indexes on target tables. |
    |Succeeded| All data is copied and the indexes are rebuilt. |

1. Check the migration details page to view the current status for each database.

   Here's an example of the AdventureWorks2019 database migration with the status **Creating**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard-creating.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a creating migration status." lightbox="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard-creating.png":::

1. In the menu bar, select **Refresh** to update the migration status.

   After migration status is refreshed, the updated status for the example AdventureWorks2019 database migration is **In progress**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard-in-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a migration in progress status." lightbox="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-dashboard-in-progress.png":::

1. Select a database name to open the table view. In this view, you see the current status of the migration, the number of tables that currently are in that status, and a detailed status of each table.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-monitoring-panel-in-progress.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows monitoring table migration." lightbox="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-monitoring-panel-in-progress.png":::

   When all table data is migrated to the Azure SQL Database target, Database Migration Service updates the migration status from **In progress** to **Succeeded**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-monitoring-panel-succeeded.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows succeeded migration." lightbox="media/tutorial-sql-server-azure-sql-database-offline-ads/monitor-migration-monitoring-panel-succeeded.png":::  

> [!NOTE]
> Database Migration Service optimizes migration by skipping tables with no data (0 rows). Tables that don't have data don't appear in the list, even if you select the tables when you create the migration.

You've completed the migration to Azure SQL Database. We encourage you to go through a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything functions smoothly and efficiently.
