# Examine the Azure AI Video Indexer output

When a video is indexed, Azure AI Video Indexer produces the JSON content that contains details of the specified video insights. The insights include transcripts, optical character recognition elements (OCRs), faces, topics, and similar details. Each insight type includes instances of time ranges that show when the insight appears in the video. 

For information, see [Azure AI Video Indexer insights](insights-overview.md).

## Root elements of the insights

|--|--|
| `accountId` | The playlist's VI account ID. |
| `id` | The playlist's ID. |
| `name` | The playlist's name. |
| `description` | The playlist's description. |
| `userName` | The name of the user who created the playlist. |
| `created` | The playlist's creation time. |
| `privacyMode` | The playlist's privacy mode (`Private` or `Public`). |
| `state` | The playlist's state (`Uploaded`, `Processing`, `Processed`, `Failed`, or `Quarantined`). |

| `isEditable` | Indicates whether the current user is authorized to edit the playlist. |
| `isBase` | Indicates whether the playlist is a base playlist (a video) or a playlist made of other videos (derived). |
| `durationInSeconds` | The total duration of the playlist. |
| `summarizedInsights` | The produced JSON output contains `Insights` and `SummarizedInsights` elements. We recommend using `Insights` and not using `SummarizedInsights` (which is present for backward compatibility). |
| `videos` | A list of [videos](#videos) that construct the playlist.<br/>If this playlist is constructed of time ranges of other videos (derived), the videos in this list contain only data from the included time ranges. |

```json
{
  ...

### insights

Each insight (for example, transcript lines, faces, or brands) contains a list of unique elements (for example, `face1`, `face2`, `face3`). Each element has its own metadata and a list of its instances, which are time ranges with additional metadata.

A face might have an ID, a name, a thumbnail, other metadata, and a list of its temporal instances (for example, `00:00:05 – 00:00:10`, `00:01:00 - 00:02:30`, and `00:41:21 – 00:41:49`). Each temporal instance can have additional metadata. For example, the metadata can include the face's rectangle coordinates (`20,230,60,60`).

| `transcript` | The [transcript](#transcript) insight. |
| `ocr` | The [OCR](#ocr) insight. |
| `keywords` | The [keywords](#keywords) insight. |
| `transcripts` | Might contain one or more [transcript](#transcript). |

#### visualContentModeration

The `visualContentModeration` transcript contains time ranges that Azure AI Video Indexer found to potentially have adult content. If `visualContentModeration` is empty, no adult content was identified.

Videos that contain adult or racy content might be available for private view only. Users can submit a request for a human review of the content. In that case, the `IsAdult` attribute contains the result of the human review.

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `id` | The ID of the visual content moderation. |
| `adultScore` | The adult score (from content moderation). |
| `racyScore` | The racy score (from content moderation). |
| `instances` | A list of time ranges where this visual content moderation appeared. |

#### topics

Azure AI Video Indexer makes an inference of main topics from transcripts. When possible, the second-level [IPTC](https://iptc.org/standards/media-topics/) taxonomy is included. 

| Name | Description |
|--|--|
| `id` | The topic's ID. |
| `name` | The topic's name. For example: `Pharmaceuticals`. |
| `referenceId` | Breadcrumbs that reflect the topic's hierarchy. For example: `HEALTH AND WELLBEING/MEDICINE AND HEALTHCARE/PHARMACEUTICALS`. |
| `confidence` | The confidence score in the range `0`-`1`. Higher is more confident. |
| `language` | The language used in the topic. |
| `iptcName` | The IPTC media code name, if detected. |
| `instances` | Currently, Azure AI Video Indexer doesn't index a topic to time intervals. The whole video is used as the interval. |

```json
"topics": [{
    "id": 0,
    "name": "INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS",
    "referenceId": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT/FOREIGN POLICY/INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS",
    "referenceType": "VideoIndexer",
