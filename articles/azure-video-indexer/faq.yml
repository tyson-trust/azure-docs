These models are only available in the account in which you created the models.

      - question: Is the content indexed by Video Indexer kept within the Azure region where I am using Video Indexer?
        answer: |
          Yes, the content and its insights are kept within the Azure region (except for Singapore and Brazil South regions) unless you have a manual configuration in your Azure subscription that uses multiple Azure regions.

          Customer data in a region is replicated for BCDR reasons to the [paired region](../availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure.md#azure-cross-region-replication-pairings-for-all-geographies).

      - question: What is the privacy policy for Azure AI Video Indexer?
        answer: |
          Azure AI Video Indexer is covered by the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). The privacy statement explains the personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes Microsoft processes it. To learn more about privacy, visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter).

      - question: What certifications does Azure AI Video Indexer have?
        answer: |
          Azure AI Video Indexer currently has the SOC certification. To review Azure AI Video Indexer's certification, please refer to the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings?product=Azure).

      - question: What is the difference between private and public videos?
        answer: |
          When videos are uploaded to Azure AI Video Indexer, you can choose from two privacy settings: private and public. Public videos are accessible for anyone, including anonymous and unidentified users. Private ones are restricted solely to the account members.

      - question: I tried to upload a video as public and it was flagged for inappropriate or offensive content, what does that mean?
        answer: |
          When uploading a video to Azure AI Video Indexer, an automatic content analysis is done by algorithms and models in order to make sure no inappropriate content will be presented publicly. If a video is found to be suspicious as containing explicit content, it will not be possible to set it as public. However, the account members can still access it as a private video (view it, download the insights and extracted artifacts, and perform other operations available to account members).

          [!INCLUDE [artifacts](./includes/artifacts.md)]

          In order to set the video for public access, you can either:

          * Build your own interface layer (such as app or website) and use it to interact with the Azure AI Video Indexer service. This way the video remains private in our [website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) and your users can interact with it through your interface. For example, you can still get the insights or allow viewing of the video in your own interface.
          * Request a human review of the content, which would result in removing of the restriction assuming the content is not explicit.

              This option can be explored if the Azure AI Video Indexer website is used directly by your users as the interface layer, and for public (unauthenticated) viewing.

        answer: |
          Follow [Tutorial: get started with the Azure AI Video Indexer API](video-indexer-use-apis.md).

      - question: What is the difference between the Azure AI Video Indexer API and the Azure Media Service v3 API?
        answer: |
          Currently there are some overlaps in features offered by the Azure AI Video Indexer API and the Azure Media Service v3 API. You can find more information on how to compare both services [here](compare-video-indexer-with-media-services-presets.md).

      - question: What is an API access token and why do I need it?
        answer: |
          The Azure AI Video Indexer API contains an Authorization API and an Operations API. The Authorizations API contains calls that give you access token. Each call to the Operations API should be associated with an access token, matching the authorization scope of the call.

          Access tokens are needed to use the Azure AI Video Indexer APIs for security purposes. This ensures that any calls are coming from you or those who have access permissions to your account. 

      - question: What is the difference between Account access token, User access token, and Video access token?
        answer: |
          * Account level – account level access tokens let you perform operations on the account level or the video level. For example, upload a video, list all videos, get video insights.
          * User level - user level access tokens let you perform operations on the user level. For example, get associated accounts.
          * Video level – video level access tokens let you perform operations on a specific video. For example, get video insights, download captions, get widgets, etc.

      - question: How often do I need to get a new access token? When do access tokens expire?
        answer: |
          Access tokens expire every hour, so you need to generate a new access token every hour.

      - question: What are the login options to Azure AI Video Indexer Developer portal?
        answer: |
          See a release note regarding [login information](release-notes.md#october-2020).

          Once you register your email account using an identity provider, you cannot use this email account with another identity provider.
          
      - question: Where are the JSON assets (like insights, transcript, etc.), associated with indexed videos, stored?
        answer: |
           They are stored by the Azure AI Video Indexer service and can be fetched with the [Get Video Index](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Video-Index) and [Get Video Artifact Download Url](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Video-Artifact-Download-Url) APIs.
 
      - question: Once a video has been indexed, are there any additional charges for calling the API? 
        answer: |
           There are no additional charges from Azure AI Video Indexer for calling the API.
        
  - name: Billing questions
    questions:
      - question: How much does Azure AI Video Indexer cost?
        answer: |
          Azure AI Video Indexer uses a simple pay-as-you-go pricing model based on the duration of the content input that you index. Additional charges may apply for encoding, streaming, storage, network usage, and media reserved units. For more information, see the [pricing](./index.yml) page.

      - question: When am I billed for using Azure AI Video Indexer?
        answer: When sending a video to be indexed, the user will define the indexing to be video analysis, audio analysis or both. This will determine which SKUs will be charged. If there is a critical level error during processing, an error code will be returned as a response. In such a case, no billing occurs. A critical error can be caused by a bug in our code or a critical failure in an internal dependency the service has. Errors such as wrong identification or insight extraction are not considered as critical and a response is returned. In any case where a valid (non-error code) response is returned, billing occurs.

      - question: Does Azure AI Video Indexer offer a trial account?
        answer: Yes, Azure AI Video Indexer offers a trial account that that provides you with 2,400 free indexing minutes when using the [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website or the Azure AI Video Indexer API (see [developer portal](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/)).
