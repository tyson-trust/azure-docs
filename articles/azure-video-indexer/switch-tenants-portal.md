# Switch between multiple tenants

When working with multiple tenants/directories in the Azure environment user might need to switch between the different directories. 

When logging in the Azure AI Video Indexer website, a default directory will load and the relevant accounts and list them in the **Account list**.

> [!Note]
> Trial accounts and Classic accounts are global and not tenant-specific. Hence, the tenant switching described in this article only applies to your ARM accounts.
>
> The option to switch directories is available only for users using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to log in. 

This article shows two options to solve the same problem - how to switch tenants:

- When starting [from within the Azure AI Video Indexer website](#switch-tenants-from-within-the-azure-ai-video-indexer-website).
- When starting [from outside of the Azure AI Video Indexer website](#switch-tenants-from-outside-the-azure-ai-video-indexer-website).

## Switch tenants from within the Azure AI Video Indexer website

1. To switch between directories in the [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/), open the **User menu** > select **Switch directory**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of a user name.](./media/switch-directory/avi-user-switch.png)

    Here user can view all detected directories listed. The current directory will be marked, once a different directory is selected the **Switch directory** button will be available. 

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Screenshot of a tenant list.](./media/switch-directory/tenants.png)

    Once clicked, the authenticated credentials will be used to sign in again to the Azure AI Video Indexer website with the new directory.
