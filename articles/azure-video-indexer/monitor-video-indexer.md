<!-- IMPORTANT STEP 1.  Do a search and replace of Azure AI Video Indexer with the name of your service. That will make the template easier to read -->

# Monitoring Azure AI Video Indexer

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Most services can use this section unchanged. Add to it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure AI Video Indexer. Azure AI Video Indexer uses [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).


<!-- Optional diagram showing monitoring for your service. -->

<!--## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal
<!-- OPTIONAL. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- If you don't have an over page, remove this section. If you keep it, edit it if there are any unique charges if your service has significant monitoring beyond Azure Monitor. -->

<!--The **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each *Azure AI Video Indexer account* includes *[provide a description of the data in the Overview page.]*.

## *Azure AI Video Indexer* insights -->

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights".

<!-- Give a quick outline of what your "insight page" provides and refer to another article that gives details -->

> [!NOTE]
> The monitoring feature is not available for trial and classic accounts. To update to an ARM account, see [Connect a classic account to ARM](connect-classic-account-to-arm.md) or [Import content from a trial account](import-content-from-trial.md).

## Monitoring data 

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->
Azure AI Video Indexer collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring *Azure AI Video Indexer* data reference](monitor-video-indexer-data-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Azure AI Video Indexer.

<!-- If your service has additional non-Azure Monitor monitoring data then outline and refer to that here. Also include that information in the data reference as appropriate. -->

## Collection and routing

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order -->

<!-- Platform metrics and the -->Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

<!-- Include any additional information on collecting logs.  The number of things that diagnostics settings control is expanding -->

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for *Azure AI Video Indexer* are listed in [Azure AI Video Indexer monitoring data reference](monitor-video-indexer-data-reference.md#resource-logs).

| Category | Description  |
|:---|:---|
|Audit | Read/Write operations|
|Indexing Logs| Monitor the indexing process from upload to indexing and Re-indexing when needed|

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor/diagnostics-settings-destination.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to send lots." lightbox="./media/monitor/diagnostics-settings-destination.png":::
<!-- OPTIONAL: Add specific examples of configuration for this service. For example, CLI and PowerShell commands for creating diagnostic setting. Ideally, customers should set up a policy to automatically turn on collection for services. Azure monitor has Resource Manager template examples you can point to. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/samples/resource-manager-diagnostic-settings.  Contact azmondocs@microsoft.com if you have questions.   -->

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

Currently Azure AI Video Indexer does not support monitoring of metrics. 
<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order 
If you don't support metrics, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to logs -->

<!--You can analyze metrics for *Azure AI Video Indexer* with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) for details on using this tool. 

<!-- Point to the list of metrics available in your monitor-service-reference article. -->
<!--For a list of the platform metrics collected for Azure AI Video Indexer, see [Monitoring *Azure AI Video Indexer* data reference metrics](monitor-service-reference.md#metrics)  

<!-- REQUIRED for services that use a Guest OS. That includes agent based services like Virtual Machines, Service Fabric, Cloud Services, and perhaps others. Delete the section otherwise -->
<!--Guest OS metrics must be collected by agents running on the virtual machines hosting your service. <!-- Add additional information as appropriate --> 
<!--For more information, see [Overview of Azure Monitor agents](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/agents-overview)  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about how to use metrics explorer specifically for your service. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

## Analyzing logs

<!-- REQUIRED. Please keep headings in this order
If you don't support resource logs, say so. Some services may be only onboarded to metrics and the activity log. -->

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md) The schema for Azure AI Video Indexer resource logs is found in the [Azure AI Video Indexer Data Reference](monitor-video-indexer-data-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) is a type of platform sign-in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Azure AI Video Indexer, see [Monitoring Azure AI Video Indexer data reference](monitor-video-indexer-data-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Azure AI Video Indexer data reference](monitor-video-indexer-data-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

<!--  Optional: Call out additional information to help your customers. For example, you can include additional information here about log usage or what logs are most important. Remember that the UI is subject to change quite often so you will need to maintain these screenshots yourself if you add them in. -->

### Sample Kusto queries

#### Audit related sample queries 
<!-- REQUIRED if you support logs. Please keep headings in this order -->
<!-- Add sample Log Analytics Kusto queries for your service. -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Azure AI Video Indexer account menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Azure AI Video Indexer account. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other Azure AI Video Indexer account or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

<!-- REQUIRED: Include queries that are helpful for figuring out the health and state of your service. Ideally, use some of these queries in the alerts section. It's possible that some of your queries may be in the Log Analytics UI (sample or example queries). Check if so.  -->

Following are queries that you can use to help you monitor your Azure AI Video Indexer account. 
<!-- Put in a code section here. -->  

```kusto
// Project failures summarized by operationName and Upn, aggregated in 30m windows.
VIAudit
| where Status == "Failure"
| summarize count() by OperationName, bin(TimeGenerated, 30m), Upn
| render timechart  
```

```kusto
// Project failures with detailed error message.
VIAudit
| where  Status == "Failure"
| parse Description with "ErrorType: " ErrorType ". Message: " ErrorMessage ". Trace" *
| project TimeGenerated, OperationName, ErrorMessage, ErrorType, CorrelationId, _ResourceId
```

#### Indexing realted sample queries

```kusto
// Display Video Indexer Account logs of all failed indexing operations. 
VIIndexing
// | where AccountId == "<AccountId>"  // to filter on a specific accountId, uncomment this line
| where Status == "Failure"
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| render columnchart
```

```kusto
// Video Indexer top 10 users by operations 
// Render timechart of top 10 users by operations, with an optional account id for filtering. 
// Trend of top 10 active Upn's
VIIndexing
// | where AccountId == "<AccountId>"  // to filter on a specific accountId, uncomment this line
| where OperationName in ("IndexingStarted", "ReindexingStarted")
| summarize count() by Upn
| top 10 by count_ desc
| project Upn
| join (VIIndexing
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where OperationName in ("IndexingStarted", "ReindexingStarted")
| summarize count() by Upn, bin(TimeGenerated,1d)) on Upn
| project TimeGenerated, Upn, count_
| render timechart
```

## Alerts

<!-- SUGGESTED: Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions or activity log. Ask your PMs if you don't know. 
This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor so do not avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive  
-->

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview.md), [logs](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log.md), and the [activity log](../azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts.md). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

<!-- only include next line if applications run on your service and work with App Insights. -->
<!-- If you are creating or running an application which run on <*service*> [Azure Monitor Application Insights](../azure-monitor/overview.md#application-insights) may offer additional types of alerts.
<!-- end -->

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Azure AI Video Indexer.

<!-- Fill in the table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary to make it more readable -->
| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Log Alert|Failed operation |Send an alert when an upload failed |

```kusto
//All failed uploads, aggregated in one hour window.
VIAudit
| where OperationName == "Upload-Video" and Status == "Failure"
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
```
