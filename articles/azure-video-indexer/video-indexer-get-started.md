# Quickstart: How to sign up and upload your first video

[!INCLUDE [Gate notice](./includes/face-limited-access.md)]

You can access Azure AI Video Indexer capabilities in three ways:

* The [Azure AI Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/): An easy-to-use solution that lets you evaluate the product, manage the account, and customize models (as described in this article).
* API integration: All of Azure AI Video Indexer's capabilities are available through a REST API, which lets you integrate the solution into your apps and infrastructure. To get started, see [Use Azure AI Video Indexer REST API](video-indexer-use-apis.md).
* Embeddable widget: Lets you embed the Azure AI Video Indexer insights, player, and editor experiences into your app. For more information, see [Embed visual widgets in your application](video-indexer-embed-widgets.md).

Once you start using Azure AI Video Indexer, all your stored data and uploaded content are encrypted at rest with a Microsoft managed key.

> [!NOTE]
> Review [planned Azure AI Video Indexer website authenticatication changes](./release-notes.md#planned-azure-ai-video-indexer-website-authenticatication-changes).

This quickstart shows you how to sign in to the Azure AI Video Indexer [website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) and how to upload your first video.

### Supported file formats for Azure AI Video Indexer

See the [input container/file formats](/azure/media-services/latest/encode-media-encoder-standard-formats-reference) article for a list of file formats that you can use with Azure AI Video Indexer.

### Upload 

1. Sign in on the [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website.
1. To upload a video, press the **Upload** button or link.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The name of the video must be no greater than 80 characters.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/video-indexer-get-started/video-indexer-upload.png" alt-text="Upload":::
1. Once your video has been uploaded, Azure AI Video Indexer starts indexing and analyzing the video. As a result a JSON output with insights is produced. 

    You see the progress.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/video-indexer-get-started/progress.png" alt-text="Progress of the upload"::: 

    The produced JSON output contains `Insights` and `SummarizedInsights` elements. We highly recommend using `Insights` and not using `SummarizedInsights` (which is present for backward compatibility). 
    
1. Once Azure AI Video Indexer is done analyzing, you'll get an email with a link to your video and a short description of what was found in your video. For example: people, spoken and written words, topics, and named entities.
1. You can later find your video in the library list and perform different operations. For example: search, reindex, edit.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > :::image type="content" source="./media/video-indexer-get-started/uploaded.png" alt-text="Uploaded the upload":::

After you upload and index a video, you can continue using [Azure AI Video Indexer website](video-indexer-view-edit.md) or [Azure AI Video Indexer API developer portal](video-indexer-use-apis.md) to see the insights of the video (see [Examine the Azure AI Video Indexer output](video-indexer-output-json-v2.md)).

## Start using insights

For more details, see [Upload and index videos](upload-index-videos.md) and check out other **How to guides**.

## Next steps

* To embed widgets, see [Embed visual widgets in your application](video-indexer-embed-widgets.md).
* For the API integration, see [Use Azure AI Video Indexer REST API](video-indexer-use-apis.md).
* Check out our [introduction lab](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-video-indexer/blob/master/IntroToVideoIndexer.md).

   At the end of the workshop, you'll have a good understanding of the kind of information that can be extracted from video and audio content, you'll be more    prepared to identify opportunities related to content intelligence, pitch video AI on Azure, and demo several scenarios on Azure AI Video Indexer.
