# Enable and view a clapperboard with extracted metadata (preview)

A clapperboard insight is used to detect clapperboard instances and information written on each. For example, *head* or *tail* (the board is upside-down), *production*, *roll*, *scene*, *take*, *date*, etc. The [clapperboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard)'s extracted metadata is most useful to customers involved in the movie post-production process. 

When the movie is being edited, a clapperboard is removed from the scene; however, the information that was written on the clapperboard is important. Azure AI Video Indexer extracts the data from clapperboards, preserves, and presents the metadata. 

This article shows how to enable the post-production insight and view clapperboard instances with extracted metadata.

## View the insight

### View post-production insights

In order to set the indexing process to include the slate metadata, select the **Video + audio indexing** -> **Advanced** presets.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="./media/slate-detection-process/advanced-setting.png" alt-text="This image shows the advanced setting in order to view post-production clapperboards insights.":::

After the file has been uploaded and indexed, if you want to view the timeline of the insight, select the **Post-production** checkmark from the list of insights.

> :::image type="content" source="./media/slate-detection-process/post-production-checkmark.png" alt-text="This image shows the post-production checkmark needed to view clapperboards.":::

### Clapperboards

Clapperboards contain fields with titles (for example, *production*, *roll*, *scene*, *take*) and values (content) associated with each title. 

For example, take this clapperboard:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="./media/slate-detection-process/clapperboard.png" alt-text="This image shows a clapperboard.":::

In the following example the board contains the following fields:

|title|content|
|---|---|
|camera|COD|
|date|FILTER (in this case the board contains no date)|
|director|John|
|production|Prod name|
|scene|1|
|take|99|

#### View the insight

To see the instances on the website, select **Insights** and scroll to **Clapperboards**. You can hover over each clapperboard, or unfold **Show/Hide clapperboard info** and see the metadata:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="./media/slate-detection-process/clapperboard-metadata.png" alt-text="This image shows the clapperboard metadata.":::

#### View the timeline

If you checked the **Post-production** insight, You can also find the clapperboard instance and its timeline (includes time, fields' values) on the **Timeline** tab.

#### View JSON

To display the JSON file: 

1. Select Download and then Insights (JSON).  
1. Copy the `clapperboard` element, under `insights`, and paste it into your Online JSON Viewer. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> :::image type="content" source="./media/slate-detection-process/clapperboard-json.png" alt-text="This image shows the clapperboard metadata in json.":::

The following table describes fields found in json:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`id`|The clapperboard ID.|
|`thumbnailId`|The ID of the thumbnail.|
|`isHeadSlate`|The value stands for head or tail (the board is upside-down) of the clapper board: `true` or `false`.|
|`fields`|The fields found in the clapper board; also each field's name and value.|
|`instances`|A list of time ranges where this element appeared.|

## Clapperboard limitations

The values may not always be correctly identified by the detection algorithm. Here are some limitations:

- The titles of the fields appearing on the clapper board are optimized to identify the most popular fields appearing on top of clapper boards.  
- Handwritten text or digital digits may not be correctly identified by the fields detection algorithm.
- The algorithm is optimized to identify fields' categories that appear horizontally.  
- The clapperboard may not be detected if the frame is blurred or that the text written on it can't be identified by the human eye.  
- Empty fieldsâ€™ values may lead to to wrong fields categories.  
<!-- If a part of a clapper board is hidden a value with the highest confidence is shown.  -->
