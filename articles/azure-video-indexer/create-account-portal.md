# Tutorial: create an ARM-based account with Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [Gate notice](./includes/face-limited-access.md)]

To start using unlimited features and robust capabilities of Azure AI Video Indexer, you need to create an Azure AI Video Indexer unlimited account. 

This tutorial walks you through the steps of creating the Azure AI Video Indexer account and its accompanying resources by using the Azure portal. The account that gets created is ARM (Azure Resource Manager) account. For information about different account types, see [Overview of account types](accounts-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

* You should be a member of your Azure subscription with either an **Owner** role, or both **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** roles. You can be added twice, with two roles, once with **Contributor** and once with **User Access Administrator**. For more information, see [View the access a user has to Azure resources](../role-based-access-control/check-access.md).
* Register the **EventGrid** resource provider using the Azure portal.
    
    In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to **Subscriptions**->[<*subscription*>]->**ResourceProviders**.
Search for **Microsoft.Media** and **Microsoft.EventGrid**. If not in the registered state, select **Register**. It takes a couple of minutes to register. 
* Have an **Owner** role (or **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** roles) assignment on the associated Azure Media Services (AMS). You select the AMS account during the Azure AI Video Indexer account creation, as described below.
* Have an **Owner** role (or **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** roles) assignment on the related managed identity.

1. Using the search bar at the top, enter **"Video Indexer"**.
1. Select **Video Indexer** under **Services**.

    Here are the definitions:
    
    | Name | Description|
    |---|---|
    |**Subscription**|Choose the subscription to use. If you're a member of only one subscription, you'll see that name. If there are multiple choices, choose a subscription in which your user has the required role.
    |**Resource group**|Select an existing resource group or create a new one. A resource group is a collection of resources that share lifecycle, permissions, and policies. Learn more [here](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#resource-groups).|
    |**Resource name**|This will be the name of the new Azure AI Video Indexer account. The name can contain letters, numbers and dashes with no spaces.|
    |**Region**|Select the Azure region that will be used to deploy the Azure AI Video Indexer account. The region matches the resource group region you chose.  If you'd like to change the selected region, change the selected resource group or create a new one in the preferred region. [Azure region in which Azure AI Video Indexer is available](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/?products=cognitive-services&regions=all)|
    |**Existing content**|If you have existing classic Video Indexer accounts, you can choose to have the videos, files, and data associated with an existing classic account connected to the new account. See the following article to learn more [Connect the classic account to ARM](connect-classic-account-to-arm.md)
    |**Available classic accounts**|Classic accounts available in the chosen subscription, resource group, and region.|
    |**Media Services account name**|Select a Media Services that the new Azure AI Video Indexer account will use to process the videos. You can select an existing Media Services or you can create a new one. The Media Services must be in the same region you selected for your Azure AI Video Indexer account.|
    |**Storage account** (appears when creating a new AMS account)|Choose or create a new storage account in the same resource group.|
    |**Managed identity**|Select an existing user-assigned managed identity or system-assigned managed identity or both when creating the account. The new Azure AI Video Indexer account will use the selected managed identity to access the Media Services associated with the account. If both user-assigned and system assigned managed identities will be selected during the account creation the **default** managed identity is the user-assigned managed identity. A contributor role should be assigned on the Media Services.|
1. Select **Review + create** at the bottom of the form.

### Essential details

* Scope: **Account**, **Project** or **Video**

    * For **Project** or **Video** you should also insert the matching ID.
* Select **Generate**

### Identity
