When you visit the [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website for the first time, a trial account is automatically created for you. With the trial account, you get some free indexing minutes. You can later add a paid account. With the paid option, you pay for indexed minutes. For details about available accounts (trial and paid options), see [Azure AI Video Indexer account types](../accounts-overview.md).
