# Provide access for developers to projects in Deployment Environments 

In Azure Deployment Environments, development team members must get access to a specific project before they can create deployment environments. By using the built-in Deployment Environments User role, you can assign permissions to Active Directory users or groups at either the project level or the environment type level. 

Based on the scope of access that you allow, a developer who has the Deployment Environments User role can:

* View the project environment types. 
* Create an environment.
* Read, write, delete, or perform actions (like deploy or reset) on their own environment.
* Read or perform actions (like deploy or reset) on environments that other users created.

When you assign the role at the project level, the user can perform the preceding actions on all environment types enabled at the project level. When you assign the role to specific environment types, the user can perform the actions only on the respective environment types.

## Assign permissions to developers for a project

1. In the Azure portal, go to your project.

1. In the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Role** | Select **[Deployment Environments User](how-to-configure-deployment-environments-user.md)**. |
    | **Assign access to** | Select **User, group, or service principal**. |
    | **Members** | Select the users or groups you want to have access to the project. |

The users can now view the project and all the environment types that you've enabled within it. Users who have the Deployment Environments User role can also [create environments from the Azure CLI](./quickstart-create-access-environments.md).

## Assign permissions to developers for an environment type

1. Select the project that you want your development team members to be able to access.
1. Select **Environment types**, and then select the ellipsis (**...**) beside the specific environment type.

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Role** | Select **[Deployment Environments User](how-to-configure-deployment-environments-user.md)**. |
    | **Assign access to** | Select **User, group, or service principal**. |
    | **Members** | Select the users or groups you want to have access to the project. |

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-create-configure-projects/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add role assignment pane.":::

The users can now view the project and the specific environment type that you've granted them access to. Users who have the Deployment Environments User role can also [create environments by using the Azure CLI](./quickstart-create-access-environments.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Only users who have the Deployment Environments User role, the DevCenter Project Admin role, or a built-in role with appropriate permissions can create environments.
