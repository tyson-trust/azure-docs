# Authenticate with client certificate

 Use the `authentication-certificate` policy to authenticate with a backend service using a client certificate. When the certificate is [installed into API Management](./api-management-howto-mutual-certificates.md) first, identify it first by its thumbprint or certificate ID (resource name). 

> [!CAUTION]
> If the certificate references a certificate stored in Azure Key Vault, identify it using the certificate ID. When a key vault certificate is rotated, its thumbprint in API Management will change, and the policy will not resolve the new certificate if it is identified by thumbprint.
