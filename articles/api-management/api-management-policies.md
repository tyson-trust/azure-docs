# API Management policy reference
This section provides links to reference articles for all API Management policies.

More information about policies:

+ [Policy overview](api-management-howto-policies.md)
+ [Set or edit policies](set-edit-policies.md)
+ [Policy expressions](api-management-policy-expressions.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  [Limit call rate by subscription](rate-limit-policy.md) and [Set usage quota by subscription](quota-policy.md) have a dependency on the subscription key. A subscription key isn't required when other policies are applied.

## Access restriction policies
-   [Check HTTP header](check-header-policy.md) - Enforces existence and/or value of an HTTP Header.
- [Get authorization context](get-authorization-context-policy.md) - Gets the authorization context of a specified [authorization](authorizations-overview.md) configured in the API Management instance.
-   [Limit call rate by subscription](rate-limit-policy.md) - Prevents API usage spikes by limiting call rate, on a per subscription basis.
-   [Limit call rate by key](rate-limit-by-key-policy.md) - Prevents API usage spikes by limiting call rate, on a per key basis.
-   [Restrict caller IPs](ip-filter-policy.md) - Filters (allows/denies) calls from specific IP addresses and/or address ranges.
-   [Set usage quota by subscription](quota-policy.md) - Allows you to enforce a renewable or lifetime call volume and/or bandwidth quota, on a per subscription basis.
-   [Set usage quota by key](quota-by-key-policy.md) - Allows you to enforce a renewable or lifetime call volume and/or bandwidth quota, on a per key basis.
-    [Validate Azure Active Directory token](validate-azure-ad-token-policy.md) - Enforces existence and validity of an Azure Active Directory JWT extracted from either a specified HTTP header, query parameter, or token value.
-   [Validate JWT](validate-jwt-policy.md) - Enforces existence and validity of a JWT extracted from either a specified HTTP Header, query parameter, or token value.

-   [Log to event hub](log-to-eventhub-policy.md) - Sends messages in the specified format to an event hub defined by a Logger entity.
-   [Mock response](mock-response-policy.md) - Aborts pipeline execution and returns a mocked response directly to the caller.
-   [Retry](retry-policy.md) - Retries execution of the enclosed policy statements, if and until the condition is met. Execution will repeat at the specified time intervals and up to the specified retry count.
-   [Return response](return-response-policy.md) - Aborts pipeline execution and returns the specified response directly to the caller.
-   [Send one way request](send-one-way-request-policy.md) - Sends a request to the specified URL without waiting for a response.
-   [Send request](send-request-policy.md) - Sends a request to the specified URL.
-   [Set HTTP proxy](proxy-policy.md) - Allows you to route forwarded requests via an HTTP proxy.
-   [Set request method](set-method-policy.md) - Allows you to change the HTTP method for a request.
-   [Set status code](set-status-policy.md) - Changes the HTTP status code to the specified value.
-   [Set variable](set-variable-policy.md) - Persists a value in a named [context](api-management-policy-expressions.md#ContextVariables) variable for later access.
-   [Trace](trace-policy.md) - Adds custom traces into the [request tracing](./api-management-howto-api-inspector.md) output in the test console, Application Insights telemetries, and resource logs.
-   [Wait](wait-policy.md) - Waits for enclosed [Send request](send-request-policy.md), [Get value from cache](cache-lookup-value-policy.md), or [Control flow](choose-policy.md) policies to complete before proceeding.

## Authentication policies
-   [Authenticate with Basic](authentication-basic-policy.md) - Authenticate with a backend service using Basic authentication.
-   [Authenticate with client certificate](authentication-certificate-policy.md) - Authenticate with a backend service using client certificates.

## Caching policies
-   [Get from cache](cache-lookup-policy.md) - Perform cache lookup and return a valid cached response when available.
-   [Store to cache](cache-store-policy.md) - Caches response according to the specified cache control configuration.
-   [Get value from cache](cache-lookup-value-policy.md) - Retrieve a cached item by key.
-   [Store value in cache](cache-store-value-policy.md) - Store an item in the cache by key.
-   [Remove value from cache](cache-remove-value-policy.md) - Remove an item in the cache by key.

## Cross-domain policies
- [Allow cross-domain calls](cross-domain-policy.md) - Makes the API accessible from Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight browser-based clients.
