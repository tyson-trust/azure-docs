# API gateway in Azure API Management

This article provides information about the roles and features of the API Management *gateway* component and compares the gateways you can deploy.

Related information:

* For an overview of API Management scenarios, components, and concepts, see [What is Azure API Management?](api-management-key-concepts.md)

* For more information about the API Management service tiers and features, see [Feature-based comparison of the Azure API Management tiers](api-management-features.md).

## Role of the gateway

The API Management *gateway* (also called *data plane* or *runtime*) is the service component that's responsible for proxying API requests, applying policies, and collecting telemetry. 

[!INCLUDE [api-management-gateway-role](../../includes/api-management-gateway-role.md)]


> [!NOTE]
> All requests to the API Management gateway, including those rejected by policy configurations, count toward configured rate limits, quotas, and billing limits if applied in the service tier. 


## Managed and self-hosted

API Management offers both managed and self-hosted gateways:

* **Managed** - The managed gateway is the default gateway component that is deployed in Azure for every API Management instance in every service tier. With the managed gateway, all API traffic flows through Azure regardless of where backends implementing the APIs are hosted. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because of differences in the underlying service architecture, the Consumption tier gateway currently lacks some capabilities of the dedicated gateway. For details, see the section [Feature comparison: Managed versus self-hosted gateways](#feature-comparison-managed-versus-self-hosted-gateways).
    >    
 

* **Self-hosted** - The [self-hosted gateway](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md) is an optional, containerized version of the default managed gateway. It's useful for hybrid and multicloud scenarios where there's a requirement to run the gateways off of Azure in the same environments where API backends are hosted. The self-hosted gateway enables customers with hybrid IT infrastructure to manage APIs hosted on-premises and across clouds from a single API Management service in Azure. 

    * The self-hosted gateway is [packaged](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#packaging) as a Linux-based Docker container and is commonly deployed to Kubernetes, including to [Azure Kubernetes Service](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-azure-kubernetes-service.md) and [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](how-to-deploy-self-hosted-gateway-azure-arc.md).

    * Each self-hosted gateway is associated with a **Gateway** resource in a cloud-based API Management instance from which it receives configuration updates and communicates status.

## Feature comparison: Managed versus self-hosted gateways

The following table compares features available in the managed gateway versus the features in the self-hosted gateway. Differences are also shown between the managed gateway for dedicated service tiers (Developer, Basic, Standard, Premium) and for the Consumption tier.

> [!NOTE]
> * Some features of managed and self-hosted gateways are supported only in certain [service tiers](api-management-features.md) or with certain [deployment environments](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#packaging) for self-hosted gateways.
> * For the current supported features of the self-hosted gateway, ensure that you have upgraded to the latest major version of the self-hosted gateway [container image](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#container-images).
> * See also self-hosted gateway [limitations](self-hosted-gateway-overview.md#limitations).

## Gateway throughput and scaling

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Throughput is affected by the number and rate of concurrent client connections, the kind and number of configured policies, payload sizes, backend API performance, and other factors. Self-hosted gateway throughput is also dependent on the compute capacity (CPU and memory) of the host where it runs. Perform gateway load testing using anticipated production conditions to determine expected throughput accurately.

### Managed gateway

For estimated maximum gateway throughput in the API Management service tiers, see [API Management pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Throughput figures are presented for information only and must not be relied upon for capacity and budget planning. See [API Management pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/) for details.

* **Dedicated service tiers**
    * Scale gateway capacity by adding and removing scale [units](upgrade-and-scale.md), or upgrade the service tier. (Scaling not available in the Developer tier.)
    * In the Standard and Premium tiers, optionally configure [Azure Monitor autoscale](api-management-howto-autoscale.md).
    * In the Premium tier, optionally add and distribute gateway capacity across multiple [regions](api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region.md).

* **Consumption tier**
    * API Management instances in the Consumption tier scale automatically based on the traffic.

### Self-hosted gateway
* In environments such as [Kubernetes](how-to-self-hosted-gateway-on-kubernetes-in-production.md), add multiple gateway replicas to handle expected usage.
* Optionally [configure autoscaling](how-to-self-hosted-gateway-on-kubernetes-in-production.md#autoscaling) to meet traffic demands.
