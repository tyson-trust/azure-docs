# ADAL-based Azure AD or Azure AD B2C identity provider retirement (September 2025)

On 30 September, 2025 as part of our continuing work to increase the resiliency of API Management services, we're removing the support for the previous library for user authentication and authorization in the developer portal (AD Authentication Library, or ADAL). You need to migrate your Azure AD or Azure AD B2C applications, change identity provider configuration to use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), and republish your developer portal.

This change will have no effect on the availability of your API Management service. However, you have to take steps described below to configure your API Management service if you wish to continue using Azure AD or Azure AD B2C identity providers beyond 30 September, 2025.

## Is my service affected by this change?

Your service is impacted by this change if:

* You've configured an [Azure AD](../api-management-howto-aad.md) or [Azure AD B2C](../api-management-howto-aad-b2c.md) identity provider for user account authentication using the ADAL and use the provided developer portal.

## What is the deadline for the change?

On 30 September, 2025, these identity providers will stop functioning. To avoid disruption of your developer portal, you need to update your Azure AD applications and identity provider configuration in Azure API Management by that date. Your developer portal might be at a security risk after Microsoft ADAL support ends in June 1, 2023. 

Developer portal sign-in and sign-up with Azure AD or Azure AD B2C will stop working past 30 September, 2025 if you don't update your ADAL-based Azure AD or Azure AD B2C identity providers. This new authentication method is more secure, as it relies on the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE and uses an up-to-date software library. 

## What do I need to do?

### Update Azure AD and Azure AD B2C applications for MSAL compatibility

[Switch redirect URIs to the single-page application type](../../active-directory/develop/migrate-spa-implicit-to-auth-code.md#switch-redirect-uris-to-spa-platform).

### Update identity provider configuration

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to your Azure API Management service.
2. Select **Identities** in the menu.
3. Select **Azure Active Directory** or **Azure Active Directory B2C** from the list.
4. Select **MSAL** in the **Client library** dropdown.
5. Select **Update**.
6. [Republish your developer portal](../api-management-howto-developer-portal-customize.md#publish-from-the-azure-portal).


## Help and support

If you have questions, get answers from community experts in [Microsoft Q&A](https://aka.ms/apim/azureqa/change/msal-2022). If you have a support plan and you need technical help, create a [support request](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/~/overview).

1. For **Summary**, type a description of your issue, for example, "stv1 retirement". 
1. Under **Issue type**, select **Technical**.  
1. Under **Subscription**, select your subscription.  
1. Under **Service**, select **My services**, then select **API Management Service**. 
1. Under **Resource**, select the Azure resource that youâ€™re creating a support request for.  
1. For **Problem type**, select **Authentication and Security**.
