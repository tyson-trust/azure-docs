# Create an authorization with the Microsoft Graph API

This article guides you through the steps required to create an [authorization](authorizations-overview.md) with the Microsoft Graph API within Azure API Management. The authorization code grant type is used in this example.

You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an Azure AD application
> * Create and configure an authorization in API Management
> * Configure an access policy
> * Create a Microsoft Graph API in API Management and configure a policy
> * Test your Microsoft Graph API in API Management

## Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant where you have permissions to create an app registration and to grant admin consent for the app's permissions. [Learn more](../active-directory/roles/delegate-app-roles.md#restrict-who-can-create-applications)

    If you want to create your own developer tenant, you can sign up for the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
- A running API Management instance. If you need to, [create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
- Enable a [system-assigned managed identity](api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity.md) for API Management in the API Management instance. 

## Step 1: Create an Azure AD application

Create an Azure AD application for the API and give it the appropriate permissions for the requests that you want to call.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account with sufficient permissions in the tenant.
1. Under **Azure Services**, search for **Azure Active Directory**.
1. On the left menu, select **App registrations**, and then select **+ New registration**. 
    :::image type="content" source="media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/create-registration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating an Azure AD app registration in the portal.":::
    
1. On the **Register an application** page, enter your application registration settings:
    1. In **Name**, enter a meaningful name that will be displayed to users of the app, such as *MicrosoftGraphAuth*.
    1. In **Supported account types**, select an option that suits your scenario, for example, **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**.
    1. Set the **Redirect URI** to **Web**,  and enter `https://authorization-manager.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect/apim/<YOUR-APIM-SERVICENAME>`, substituting the name of the API Management service where you will configure the authorization provider.
    1. Select **Register**.
1. On the left menu, select **API permissions**, and then select **+ Add a permission**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/add-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding an API permission in the portal.":::

    1. Select **Microsoft Graph**, and then select **Delegated permissions**.
        > [!NOTE]
        > Make sure the permission **User.Read** with the type **Delegated** has already been added.
    1. Type **Team**, expand the **Team** options, and then select **Team.ReadBasic.All**. Select **Add permissions**.
    1. Next, select **Grant admin consent for Default Directory**. The status of the permissions will change to **Granted for Default Directory**.
1. On the left menu, select **Overview**. On the **Overview** page, find the **Application (client) ID** value and record it for use in Step 2.
1. On the left menu, select **Certificates & secrets**, and then select **+ New client secret**.    
    :::image type="content" source="media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/create-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating an app secret in the portal.":::
    
    1. Enter a **Description**.
    1. Select any option for **Expires**.
    1. Select **Add**.
    1. Copy the client secret's **Value** before leaving the page. You will need it in Step 2.

## Step 2: Configure an authorization in API Management

1. Sign into the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to your API Management instance.
1. On the left menu, select **Authorizations**, and then select **+ Create**.    
    :::image type="content" source="media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/create-authorization.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating an API authorization in the portal.":::    
1. On the **Create authorization** page, enter the following settings, and select **Create**:
    
    |Settings  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Provider name**     |  A name of your choice, such as *aad-01*       |
    |**Identity provider**     |   Select **Azure Active Directory v1**      |
    |**Grant type**     | Select **Authorization code**        |
    |**Client id**     |   Paste the value you copied earlier from the app registration      |
    |**Client secret**     |    Paste the value you copied earlier from the app registration      |
    |**Resource URL** | `https://graph.microsoft.com` |
    |**Tenant ID** | Optional for Azure AD identity provider. Default is *Common* |
    |**Scopes**     |    Optional for Azure AD identity provider. Automatically configured from AD app's API permissions.      |
    |**Authorization name**    | A name of your choice, such as *aad-auth-01*        |
  
1. After the authorization provider and authorization are created, select **Next**.

## Step 3: Authorize with Azure AD and configure an access policy

1. On the **Login** tab, select **Login with Azure Active Directory**. Before the authorization will work, it needs to be authorized.
    :::image type="content" source="media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/login-azure-ad.png" alt-text="Screenshot of login with Azure AD in the portal.":::

1. When prompted, sign in to your organizational account.
1. On the confirmation page, select **Allow access**.
1. After successful authorization, the browser is redirected to API Management and the window is closed. In API Management, select **Next**.
1. On the **Access policy** page, create an access policy so that API Management has access to use the authorization. Ensure that a managed identity is configured for API Management. [Learn more about managed identities in API Management](api-management-howto-use-managed-service-identity.md#create-a-system-assigned-managed-identity).
1. For this example, select **API Management service `<service name>`**, and then click "+ Add members". You should see your access policy in the Members table below.

    :::image type="content" source="media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/create-access-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting a managed identity to use the authorization."::: 
 
1. Select **Complete**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you update your Microsoft Graph permissions after this step, you will have to repeat Steps 2 and 3.

## Step 4: Create a Microsoft Graph API in API Management and configure a policy

1. Sign into the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to your API Management instance.
1. On the left menu, select **APIs > + Add API**.
1. Select **HTTP** and enter the following settings. Then select **Create**.

    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Display name**     | *msgraph*        |
    |**Web service URL**     |  `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`       |
    |**API URL suffix**     |  *msgraph*       |

1. Navigate to the newly created API and select **Add Operation**. Enter the following settings and select **Save**.

    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Display name**     | *getprofile*        |
    |**URL** for GET    |  /me |

1. Follow the preceding steps to add another operation with the following settings.

    |Setting  |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Display name**     | *getJoinedTeams*        |
    |**URL** for GET    |  /me/joinedTeams |

1. Select **All operations**. In the **Inbound processing** section, select the (**</>**) (code editor) icon.
1. Copy the following, and paste in the policy editor. Make sure the `provider-id` and `authorization-id` correspond to the values you configured in Step 2. Select **Save**. 

    ```xml
    <policies>
        <inbound>
            <base />
            <get-authorization-context provider-id="aad-01" authorization-id="aad-auth-01" context-variable-name="auth-context" identity-type="managed" ignore-error="false" />
           <set-header name="authorization" exists-action="override">
               <value>@("Bearer " + ((Authorization)context.Variables.GetValueOrDefault("auth-context"))?.AccessToken)</value>
           </set-header>
        </inbound>
        <backend>
            <base />
        </backend>
        <outbound>
            <base />
        </outbound>
        <on-error>
            <base />
        </on-error>
    </policies>
    ```
The preceding policy definition consists of two parts:

* The [get-authorization-context](get-authorization-context-policy.md) policy fetches an authorization token by referencing the authorization provider and authorization that were created earlier. 
* The [set-header](set-header-policy.md) policy creates an HTTP header with the fetched authorization token.

## Step 5: Test the API 
1. On the **Test** tab, select one operation that you configured.
1. Select **Send**. 
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/authorizations-how-to-azure-ad/graph-api-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot of testing the Graph API in the portal.":::

    A successful response returns user data from the Microsoft Graph.
