# Manage APIs and other resources in your API Management workspace

This article is an introduction to managing APIs, products, subscriptions, and other API Management resources in a *workspace*. A workspace is a place where a development team can own, manage, update, and productize their own APIs, while a central API platform team manages the API Management infrastructure. Learn about the [workspace features](workspaces-overview.md)

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> * Workspaces are a preview feature of API Management and subject to certain [limitations](workspaces-overview.md#preview-limitations).
> * Workspaces are supported in API Management REST API version 2022-09-01-preview or later.
> * For pricing considerations, see [API Management pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/).

## Prerequisites

* An API Management instance. If needed, ask an administrator to [create one](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
* A workspace. If needed, ask an administrator of your API Management instance to [create one](how-to-create-workspace.md).
* Permissions to collaborate in the workspace. If needed, ask an administrator of your API Management instance to assign you appropriate [roles](api-management-role-based-access-control.md#built-in-workspace-roles) in the service and the workspace.

## Go to the workspace - portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and navigate to your API Management instance.

## Get started with your workspace

Depending on your role in the workspace, you might have permissions to create APIs, products, subscriptions, and other resources, or you might have read-only access to some or all of them.
