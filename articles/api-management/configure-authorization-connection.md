# Configure multiple authorization connections

You can configure multiple authorizations (also called *authorization connections*) to an authorization provider in your API Management instance. For example, if you configured Azure AD as an authorization provider, you might need to create multiple authorizations for different scenarios and users.

In this article, you learn how to add an authorization connection to an existing provider, using the portal. For an overview of configuration steps, see [How to configure authorizations?](authorizations-overview.md#how-to-configure-authorizations)

## Prerequisites

* An API Management instance. If you need to, [create one](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
* A configured authorization provider. For example, see the steps to create a provider for [GitHub](authorizations-how-to-github.md) or [Azure AD](authorizations-how-to-azure-ad.md).
 
## Create an authorization connection - portal

1. Sign into [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, select **Authorizations**.
1. Select the authorization provider that you want to create multiple connections for (for example, *mygithub*).

    1. On the **Authorization** tab, enter an **Authorization name**. Select **Create**, then select **Next**. 
    1. On the **Login** tab (for authorization code grant type), complete the steps to login to the authorization provider to allow access. Select **Next**.
    1. On the **Access policy** tab, assign access to the Azure AD identity or identities that can use the authorization. Select **Complete**.
1. The new connection appears in the list of authorizations, and shows a status of **Connected**.

You can manage authorization provider settings and authorization connections in the portal. For example, you might need to update client credentials for the authorization provider.

To update provider settings:

1. Sign into [portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to your API Management instance.
1. In the left menu, select **Authorizations**.
1. Select the authorization provider that you want to manage.
1. In the provider windows, select **Settings**.
1. In the provider settings, make updates, and select **Save**.
