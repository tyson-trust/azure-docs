# Monitoring Virtual WAN data reference

This article provides a reference of log and metric data collected to analyze the performance and availability of Virtual WAN. See [Monitoring Virtual WAN](monitor-virtual-wan.md) for instructions and additional context on monitoring data for Virtual WAN.

## <a name="metrics"></a>Metrics

### <a name="hub-router-metrics"></a>Virtual hub router metrics  

The following metric is available for virtual hub router within a virtual hub:

| Metric | Description|
| --- | --- |
| **Virtual Hub Data Processed** | Data on how much traffic traverses the virtual hub router in a given time period. Note that only the following flows use the virtual hub router: VNet to VNet (same hub) and VPN/ExpressRoute branch to VNet (interhub).|

#### PowerShell steps

To query, use the following example PowerShell commands. The necessary fields are explained below the example.

**Step 1:**

```azurepowershell-interactive
$MetricInformation = Get-AzMetric -ResourceId "/subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.Network/VirtualHubs/<VirtualHubName>" -MetricName "VirtualHubDataProcessed" -TimeGrain 00:05:00 -StartTime 2022-2-20T01:00:00Z -EndTime 2022-2-20T01:30:00Z -AggregationType Sum
```

**Step 2:**

```azurepowershell-interactive
$MetricInformation.Data
```

* **Resource ID** - Your virtual hub's Resource ID can be found on the Azure portal. Navigate to the virtual hub page within vWAN and select **JSON View** under Essentials.  

* **Metric Name** - Refers to the name of the metric you're querying, which in this case is called 'VirtualHubDataProcessed'. This metric shows all the data that the virtual hub router has processed in the selected time period of the hub.  

* **Time Grain** - Refers to the frequency at which you want to see the aggregation. In the current command, you'll see a selected aggregated unit per 5 mins. You can select – 5M/15M/30M/1H/6H/12H and 1D.

* **Start Time and End Time** - This time is based on UTC, so please ensure that you're entering UTC values when inputting these parameters. If these parameters aren't used, the past one hour's worth of data is shown by default.  

* **Sum Aggregation Type** - This aggregation type will show you the total number of bytes that traversed the virtual hub router during a selected time period. The **Max** and **Min** aggregation types are not meaningful.

| Metric | Description|
| --- | --- |
| **Gateway Diagnostic Logs** | Gateway-specific diagnostics such as health, configuration, service updates, and additional diagnostics.|
| **Tunnel Diagnostic Logs** | These are IPsec tunnel-related logs such as connect and disconnect events for a site-to-site IPsec tunnel, negotiated SAs, disconnect reasons, and additional diagnostics.

| **IKE Diagnostic Logs** | IKE-specific diagnostics for IPsec connections. |

### <a name="p2s-diagnostic"></a>Point-to-site VPN gateway diagnostics

The following diagnostics are available for Virtual WAN point-to-site VPN gateways:

| --- | --- |
| **Gateway Diagnostic Logs** | Gateway-specific diagnostics such as health, configuration, service updates, and other diagnostics. |
| **IKE Diagnostic Logs** | IKE-specific diagnostics for IPsec connections.|
| **P2S Diagnostic Logs** | These are User VPN P2S (Point-to-site) configuration and client events. They include client connect/disconnect, VPN client address allocation, and other diagnostics.|

### ExpressRoute gateway diagnostics

In Azure Virtual WAN, ExpressRoute gateway metrics can be exported as logs via a diagnostic setting.

### Log Analytics sample query

If you selected to send diagnostic data to a Log Analytics Workspace, then you can use SQL-like queries such as the example below to examine the data. For more information, see [Log Analytics Query Language](/services-hub/health/log-analytics-query-language).

The following example contains a query to obtain site-to-site route diagnostics.

`AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "RouteDiagnosticLog"`

Replace the values below, after the **= =**, as needed based on the tables reported in the previous section of this article.

* "GatewayDiagnosticLog"
* "IKEDiagnosticLog"
* "P2SDiagnosticLog”
* "TunnelDiagnosticLog"
* "RouteDiagnosticLog"

In order to execute the query, you have to open the Log Analytics resource you configured to receive the diagnostic logs, and then select **Logs** under the **General** tab on the left side of the pane:

:::image type="content" source="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/log-analytics-query-samples.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Log Analytics Query samples." lightbox="./media/monitor-virtual-wan-reference/log-analytics-query-samples.png":::

For Azure Firewall, a [workbook](../firewall/firewall-workbook.md) is provided to make log analysis easier. Using its graphical interface, it will be possible to investigate the diagnostic data without manually writing any Log Analytics query.

## <a name="activity-logs"></a>Activity logs

[**Activity log**](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) entries are collected by default and can be viewed in the Azure portal. You can use Azure activity logs (formerly known as *operational logs* and *audit logs*) to view all operations submitted to your Azure subscription.

You can view activity logs independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.

For more information on the schema of Activity Log entries, see [Activity Log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema.md).

## <a name="schemas"></a>Schemas

For detailed description of the top-level diagnostic logs schema, see [Supported services, schemas, and categories for Azure Diagnostic Logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md).

When reviewing any metrics through Log Analytics, the output will contain the following columns:

|**Column**|**Type**|**Description**|
| --- | --- | --- |
|TimeGrain|string|PT1M (metric values are pushed every minute)|
|Count|real|Usually equal to 2 (each MSEE pushes a single metric value every minute)|
|Minimum|real|The minimum of the two metric values pushed by the two MSEEs|
|Maximum|real|The maximum of the two metric values pushed by the two MSEEs|
|Average|real|Equal to (Minimum + Maximum)/2|
|Total|real|Sum of the two metric values from both MSEEs (the main value to focus on for the metric queried)|

## <a name="azure-firewall"></a>Monitoring secured hub (Azure Firewall)

If you have chosen to secure your virtual hub using Azure Firewall, relevant logs and metrics are available here: [Azure Firewall logs and metrics](../firewall/logs-and-metrics.md).
You can monitor the Secured Hub using Azure Firewall logs and metrics. You can also use activity logs to audit operations on Azure Firewall resources.
For every Azure Virtual WAN you secure and convert to a Secured Hub, an explicit firewall resource object is created in the resource group where the hub is located.
