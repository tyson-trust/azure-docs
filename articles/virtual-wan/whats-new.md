## Known issues

|#|Issue|Description |Date first reported|Mitigation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Virtual hub upgrade to VMSS-based infrastructure: Compatibility with NVA in a hub.|For deployments with an NVA provisioned in the hub, the virtual hub router can't be upgraded to Virtual Machine Scale Sets.| July 2022|The Virtual WAN team is working on a fix that will allow Virtual hub routers to be upgraded to Virtual Machine Scale Sets, even if an NVA is provisioned in the hub. After you upgrade the hub router, you'll have to re-peer the NVA with the hub router’s new IP addresses (instead of having to delete the NVA).|
|2|Virtual hub upgrade to VMSS-based infrastructure: Compatibility with NVA in a spoke VNet.|For deployments with an NVA provisioned in a spoke VNet, you will have to delete and recreate the BGP peering with the spoke NVA.|March 2022|The Virtual WAN team is working on a fix to remove the need for users to delete and recreate the BGP peering with a spoke NVA after upgrading.|
|3|Virtual hub upgrade to VMSS-based infrastructure: Compatibility with spoke VNets in different regions |If your Virtual WAN hub is connected to a combination of spoke virtual networks in the same region as the hub and a separate region than the hub, then you may experience a lack of connectivity to these respective spoke virtual networks after upgrading your hub router to VMSS-based infrastructure.|March 2023|To resolve this and restore connectivity to these virtual networks, you can modify any of the virtual network connection properties (For example, you can modify the connection to propagate to a dummy label). We're actively working on removing this requirement. |
|4|Virtual hub upgrade to VMSS-based infrastructure: Compatibility with more than 100 spoke VNets |If your Virtual WAN hub is connected to more than 100 spoke VNets, then the upgrade may time out, causing your virtual hub to remain on Cloud Services-based infrastructure.|March 2023|The Virtual WAN team is working on a fix to support upgrades when there are more than 100 spoke VNets connected.|
|5|ExpressRoute connectivity with Azure Storage and the 0.0.0.0/0 route|If you have configured a 0.0.0.0/0 route statically in a virtual hub route table or dynamically via a network virtual appliance for traffic inspection, that traffic will bypass inspection when destined for Azure Storage and is in the same region as the ExpressRoute gateway in the virtual hub. As a workaround, you can either use [Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md) to access Azure Storage or put the Azure Storage service in a different region than the virtual hub.|
|6| Default routes (0/0) won't propagate inter-hub |0/0 routes won't propagate between two virtual WAN hubs. | June 2020 |  None. Note: While the Virtual WAN team has fixed the issue, wherein static routes defined in the static route section of the VNet peering page propagate to route tables listed in "propagate to route tables" or the labels listed in "propagate to route tables" on the VNet connection page, default routes (0/0) won't propagate inter-hub. |
|7| Two ExpressRoute circuits in the same peering location connected to multiple hubs |If you have two ExpressRoute circuits in the same peering location, and both of these circuits are connected to multiple virtual hubs in the same Virtual WAN, then connectivity to your Azure resources may be impacted. | July 2023 | Make sure each virtual hub has at least 1 virtual network connected to it. This will ensure connectivity to your Azure resources. The Virtual WAN team is also working on a fix for this issue. |
