# About Route-maps for virtual hubs (Preview)

Route-maps is a powerful feature that gives you the ability to control route advertisements and routing for Virtual WAN virtual hubs. Route-maps lets you have more control of the routing  that enters and leaves Azure Virtual WAN site-to-site (S2S) VPN connections, User VPN point-to-site (P2S) connections, ExpressRoute (ER) connections, and virtual network (VNet) connections. Route-maps can be configured using the [Azure portal](route-maps-how-to.md).

In Virtual WAN, the virtual hub router acts as a route manager, providing simplification in routing operations within and across virtual hubs. The virtual hub router simplifies routing management by being the central routing engine that talks to gateways (S2S, ER, and P2S), Azure Firewall, and Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs). While the gateways make their routing decisions, the virtual hub router provides central route management and enables advanced routing scenarios in the virtual hub with features such as custom route tables, route association, and propagation.

Route-maps lets you perform route aggregation, route filtering, and gives you the ability to modify BGP attributes such as AS-PATH and Community to manage routes and routing decisions.

* **Connection:** A route map can be applied to user, branch, ExpressRoute, and VNet connections.

  * ExpressRoute connection: The hub's connection to an ER circuit.
  * Site-to-site VPN connection: The hub's connection to a VPN site.
  * VNet connection: The hub's connection to a virtual network.
  * Point-to-site connection: The hubâ€™s connection to a P2S user.

   A virtual hub can have a route map applied to any of the connections, as shown in the following diagram:

* **Route aggregation:** Route-maps lets you reduce the number of routes coming in and/or out of a connection by summarizing. (Example: 10.2.1.0.0/24, 10.2.2.0/24 and 10.2.3.0/24 can be summarized to 10.2.0.0/16)
* **Route Filtering:** Route-maps lets you exclude routes that are advertised or received from ExpressRoute connections, site-to-site VPN connections, VNet connections, and point-to-site connections.
* **Modify BGP attributes:** Route-maps lets you modify AS-PATH and BGP Communities. You can now add or set ASNs (Autonomous system numbers).

## Benefits and considerations

[!INCLUDE [Preview text](../../includes/virtual-wan-route-maps-preview.md)]

### Key benefits

* If you have on-premises networks connected to Virtual WAN via ExpressRoute or VPN and are limited by the number of routes that can be advertised from/to virtual hub, you can use route maps to summarize routes.
* You can use route maps to control routes entering and leaving your Virtual WAN deployment among on-premises and virtual-networks.
* You can control routing decisions in your Virtual WAN deployment by modifying a BGP attribute such as *AS-PATH* to make a route more, or less preferable. This is helpful when there are destination prefixes reachable via multiple paths and customers want to use AS-PATH to control best path selection.  
* You can easily tag routes using the BGP Community attribute in order to manage routes.

### Key considerations

* During Preview, hubs using Route-maps must be deployed in their own virtual WANs.
* Route-maps is only available for virtual hubs running on the Virtual Machine Scale Sets infrastructure. For more information, see the [FAQ](virtual-wan-faq.md).
* When using route maps to summarize a set of routes, the hub router strips the *BGP Community* and *AS-PATH* attributes from those routes. This applies to both inbound and outbound routes.
* When adding ASNs to the AS-PATH, don't use ASNs reserved by Azure:
  * Public ASNs: 8074, 8075, 12076
  * Private ASNs: 65515, 65517, 65518, 65519, 65520
* Route maps can't be applied to connections between on-premises and SD-WAN/Firewall NVAs in the virtual hub. These connections aren't supported during Preview. You can still apply route maps to other supported connections when an NVA in the virtual hub is deployed. This doesn't apply to the Azure Firewall, as the routing for Azure Firewall is provided through Virtual WAN [routing intent features](how-to-routing-policies.md).
* Route-maps supports only 2-byte ASN numbers.
* Recommended best practices:
  * Configure rules to only match the routes intended to avoid unintended traffic flows.
  * The Route-maps feature contains some implicit functions, such as when no match conditions or actions are defined in a rule. Review the rules for each section.
  * A prefix can either be modified by route maps, or can be modified by NAT, but not both.
  * Route maps won't be applied to the [hub address space](virtual-wan-site-to-site-portal.md#hub).
* The point-to-site Multipool feature isn't currently supported with Route-maps.

## Configuration workflow

This section outlines the basic workflow for Route-maps. You can [configure route maps](route-maps-how-to.md) using the Azure portal.

1. Contact preview-route-maps@microsoft.com for access to the preview.
1. Create a virtual WAN.
1. Create all Virtual WAN virtual hubs needed for testing.
1. Deploy any site-to-site VPN, point-to-site VPN, ExpressRoute gateways, and NVAs needed for testing.
1. Verify that incoming and outgoing routes are working as expected.
1. [Configure a route map and route map rules](route-maps-how-to.md), then save.
1. Once a route map is configured, the virtual hub router and gateways begin an upgrade needed to support the Route-maps feature.

   * The upgrade process takes around 30 minutes.
   * The upgrade process only happens the first time a route map is created on a hub.
   * If the route map is deleted, the virtual hub router remains on the new version of software.
   * Using Route-maps will incur an additional charge. For more information, see the [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-wan/) page.
1. The process is complete when the Provisioning state is 'Succeeded'. Open a support case if the process failed.
1. The route map can now be applied to connections (ExpressRoute, S2S VPN, P2S VPN, VNet).
1. Once the route map has been applied in the correct direction, use the [Route-map dashboard](route-maps-dashboard.md) to verify that the route map is working as expected.

## Route map rules

A route map is an ordered sequence of one or more rules that are applied to routes received or sent by the virtual hub. Each route map rule is composed of 3 sections: match conditions, actions to be performed, and applying the route map to connections.

### Match conditions

Route-maps allows you to match routes using Route-prefix, BGP community, and AS-Path. These are the set of conditions that a processed route must meet to be considered as a match for the rule.

* A route map rule can have any number of match conditions.
* If a route map is created without a match condition, all routes from the applied connection will be matched. For example, a site-to-site VPN connection has routes 10.2.1.0/24, 10.2.2.0/24 and 10.2.3.0/24 being advertised from Azure to a branch office. A route map without a match condition will match 10.2.1.0/24, 10.2.2.0/24 and 10.2.3.0/24.
* If a route map has multiple match conditions, then a route must meet all the match conditions to be considered a match for the rule. The order of the match conditions isn't relevant. For example, a site-to-site VPN connection has routes 10.2.1.0/24 with an AS path of 65535 and a BGP community of 65535:100 being advertised from Azure to a branch office. If a route map is created to on the connection with a rule to match on prefix 10.2.1.0, with another rule to match on 65535. Both conditions need to be met to be considered a match.
* Multiple rules are supported. If the first rule isn't matched, then the second rule is evaluated. Select "Terminate" in the "Next step" field to the end of the rule. When no rule is matched, the default is to allow, not to deny.

### Actions

The match conditions are used to select a set of routes. Once those routes are selected, they can be dropped or modified.

* **Drop:** All the matched routes are dropped (i.e filtered-out) from the route advertisement. For example, a site-to-site VPN connection has routes 10.2.1.0/24, 10.2.2.0/24 and 10.2.3.0/24 being advertised from Azure to a branch office. A route map can be configured to drop 10.2.1.0/24, 10.2.2.0/24, resulting in only 10.2.3.0/24 being advertised from Azure to a branch office.

* **Modify:** The possible route modifications are aggregating route-prefixes or modifying route BGP attributes. For example, a site-to-site VPN connection has routes 10.2.1.0/24 with an AS path of 65535 and a BGP community of 65535:100 being advertised from Azure to a branch office. A route map can be configured to add the AS path of [65535, 65005].

After configuring a rule to drop or modify routes, it must be determined if the route map will continue to the next rule or stop. The "Next step" setting is used to determine if the route map will move to the next rule, or stop.

Things to consider:

* A route map rule can have any number of route modifications configured. It's possible to have a route map without any rules.
* If a route map has no actions configured in a rule, the routes are unaltered.
* If a route map has multiple modifications configured in a rule, all configured actions are applied on the route. The order of the actions isn't relevant.
* If a route isn't matched by all the match conditions in a rule, the route isn't considered a match for the rule. The route is passed on to the rule under the route map, irrespective of the **Next step** setting.

## Applying route maps

On each connection, you can apply route maps for the inbound, outbound, or both inbound and outbound directions.

When a route map is configured on a connection in the inbound direction, all the ingress route advertisements on that connection are processed by the route map before they're entered into the virtual hub routerâ€™s routing table, defaultRouteTable. Similarly, when a route map is configured on a connection in the outbound direction, all the egress route advertisements on that connection are processed by the route map before they're advertised by the virtual hub router across the connection.

You can choose to apply same or different route maps in inbound and outbound directions, but only one route map can be applied in each direction.

You can view the routes from connections where a route map has been applied by using the **Route-map** dashboard. For ExpressRoute connections, a route map can't be applied on MSEE devices.
