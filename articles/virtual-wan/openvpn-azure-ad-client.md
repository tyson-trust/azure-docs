# Configure a VPN client for P2S OpenVPN protocol connections: Azure AD authentication

This article helps you configure a VPN client to connect using point-to-site VPN and Azure Active Directory authentication. Before you can connect and authenticate using Azure AD, you must first configure your Azure AD tenant. For more information, see [Configure an Azure AD tenant](openvpn-azure-ad-tenant.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD authentication is supported only for OpenVPNÂ® protocol connections.

## <a name="profile"></a>Working with client profiles

For every computer that wants to connect to the VNet via the VPN client, you need to download the Azure VPN Client for the computer, and also configure a VPN client profile. If you want to configure multiple computers, you can create a client profile on one computer, export it, and then import it to other computers.

### To download the Azure VPN client

[!INCLUDE [Download Azure VPN client](../../includes/vpn-gateway-download-vpn-client.md)]

### <a name="cert"></a>To create a certificate-based client profile

When working with a certificate-based profile, make sure that the appropriate certificates are installed on the client computer. You can install and specify more than one certificate when using the Azure VPN client version 2.1963.44.0 or higher. For more information about certificates, see [Install client certificates](certificates-point-to-site.md).
