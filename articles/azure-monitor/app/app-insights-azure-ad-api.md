# Application Insights API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authentication

You can submit a query request by using the Azure Monitor Application Insights endpoint `https://api.applicationinsights.io`. To access the endpoint, you must authenticate through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Set up authentication

To access the API, you register a client app with Azure AD and request a token.

1. [Register an app in Azure AD](../logs/api/register-app-for-token.md).

1. On the app's overview page, select **API permissions**.
1. Select **Add a permission**.
1. On the **APIs my organization uses** tab, search for **Application Insights** and select **Application Insights API** from the list.

1. Select **Delegated permissions**.
1. Select the **Data.Read** checkbox.
1. Select **Add permissions**.

Now that your app is registered and has permissions to use the API, grant your app access to your Application Insights resource.

1. From your **Application Insights resource** overview page, select **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Select **Add role assignment**.

1. Select the **Reader** role and then select **Members**.

1. On the **Members** tab, choose **Select members**.
1. Enter the name of your app in the **Select** box.
1. Select your app and choose **Select**.
1. Select **Review + assign**.

1. After you finish the Active Directory setup and permissions, request an authorization token.

>[!Note]
> For this example, we applied the Reader role. This role is one of many built-in roles and might include more permissions than you require. More granular roles and permissions can be created. 

## Request an authorization token

Before you begin, make sure you have all the values required to make the request successfully. All requests require:
- Your Azure AD tenant ID.
- Your App Insights App ID - If you are currently using API Keys, this is the same app ID.
- Your Azure AD client ID for the app.
- An Azure AD client secret for the app.

The Application Insights API supports Azure AD authentication with three different [Azure AD OAuth2](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code) flows:
- Client credentials
- Authorization code
- Implicit

### Client credentials flow

In the client credentials flow, the token is used with the Application Insights endpoint. A single request is made to receive a token by using the credentials provided for your app in the previous step when you [register an app in Azure AD](../logs/api/register-app-for-token.md).

Use the `https://api.applicationinsights.io` endpoint.

#### Client credentials token URL (POST request)

```http
    POST /<your-tenant-id>/oauth2/token
    Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    grant_type=client_credentials
    &client_id=<app-client-id>
    &resource=https://api.applicationinsights.io
    &client_secret=<app-client-secret>
```

A successful request receives an access token in the response:

```http
    {
        token_type": "Bearer",
        "expires_in": "86399",
        "ext_expires_in": "86399",
        "access_token": ""eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ.....Ax"
    }
```

Use the token in requests to the Application Insights endpoint:

```http
    POST /v1/apps/yous_app_id/query?timespan=P1D
    Host: https://api.applicationinsights.io
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: bearer <your access token>

    Body:
    {
    "query": "requests | take 10"
    }
```

Example response:

```{

### Authorization code flow

The main OAuth2 flow supported is through [authorization codes](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code). This method requires two HTTP requests to acquire a token with which to call the Azure Monitor Application Insights API. There are two URLs, with one endpoint per request. Their formats are described in the following sections.

#### Authorization code URL (GET request)

```http
    GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_Azure AD_TENANT/oauth2/authorize?
    client_id=<app-client-id>
    &response_type=code
    &redirect_uri=<app-redirect-uri>
    &resource=https://api.applicationinsights.io
```

When a request is made to the authorize URL, the client\_id is the application ID from your Azure AD app, copied from the app's properties menu. The redirect\_uri is the homepage/login URL from the same Azure AD app. When a request is successful, this endpoint redirects you to the sign-in page you provided at sign-up with the authorization code appended to the URL. See the following example:

```http
    http://<app-client-id>/?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&session_state=STATE_GUID
```

At this point, you've obtained an authorization code, which you need now to request an access token.

#### Authorization code token URL (POST request)

```http
    POST /YOUR_Azure AD_TENANT/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    grant_type=authorization_code
    &client_id=<app client id>
    &code=<auth code fom GET request>
    &redirect_uri=<app-client-id>
    &resource=https://api.applicationinsights.io
    &client_secret=<app-client-secret>
```

All values are the same as before, with some additions. The authorization code is the same code you received in the previous request after a successful redirect. The code is combined with the key obtained from the Azure AD app. If you didn't save the key, you can delete it and create a new one from the keys tab of the Azure AD app menu. The response is a JSON string that contains the token with the following schema. Types are indicated for the token values.

Response example:

```http
    {
        "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ.....Ax",
        "expires_in": "3600",
        "ext_expires_in": "1503641912",
        "id_token": "not_needed_for_app_insights",
        "not_before": "1503638012",
        "refresh_token": "eyJ0esdfiJKV1ljhgYF.....Az",
        "resource": "https://api.applicationinsights.io",
        "scope": "Data.Read",
        "token_type": "bearer"
    }
```

The access token portion of this response is what you present to the Application Insights API in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. You can also use the refresh token in the future to acquire a new access\_token and refresh\_token when yours have gone stale. For this request, the format and endpoint are:

```http
    POST /YOUR_AAD_TENANT/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
    Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    client_id=<app-client-id>
    &refresh_token=<refresh-token>
    &grant_type=refresh_token
    &resource=https://api.applicationinsights.io
    &client_secret=<app-client-secret>
```

Response example:

```http
    {
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": "3600",
      "expires_on": "1460404526",
      "resource": "https://api.applicationinsights.io",
      "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ.....Ax",
      "refresh_token": "eyJ0esdfiJKV1ljhgYF.....Az"
    }
```

### Implicit code flow

The Application Insights API supports the OAuth2 [implicit flow](/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-dev-understanding-oauth2-implicit-grant). For this flow, only a single request is required, but no refresh token can be acquired.

#### Implicit code authorize URL

```http
    GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_AAD_TENANT/oauth2/authorize?
    client_id=<app-client-id>
    &response_type=token
    &redirect_uri=<app-redirect-uri>
    &resource=https://api.applicationinsights.io
```

A successful request produces a redirect to your redirect URI with the token in the URL:

```http
    http://YOUR_REDIRECT_URI/#access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=3600&session_state=STATE_GUID
```

This access\_token can be used as the `Authorization: Bearer` header value when it's passed to the Application Insights API to authorize requests.
