# Track incoming requests with OpenCensus Python

OpenCensus Python and its integrations collect incoming request data. You can track incoming request data sent to your web applications built on top of the popular web frameworks Django, Flask, and Pyramid. Application Insights receives the data as `requests` telemetry.

First, instrument your Python application with the latest [OpenCensus Python SDK](./opencensus-python.md).

## Track Django applications

1. Download and install `opencensus-ext-django` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencensus-ext-django/). Instrument your application with the `django` middleware. Incoming requests sent to your Django application are tracked.

1. Include `opencensus.ext.django.middleware.OpencensusMiddleware` in your `settings.py` file under `MIDDLEWARE`.

    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = (
        ...
        'opencensus.ext.django.middleware.OpencensusMiddleware',
        ...
    )
    ```

1. Make sure AzureExporter is configured properly in your `settings.py` under `OPENCENSUS`. For requests from URLs that you don't want to track, add them to `EXCLUDELIST_PATHS`.

    ```python
    OPENCENSUS = {
        'TRACE': {
            'SAMPLER': 'opencensus.trace.samplers.ProbabilitySampler(rate=1)',
            'EXPORTER': '''opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter.AzureExporter(
                connection_string="InstrumentationKey=<your-ikey-here>"
            )''',
            'EXCLUDELIST_PATHS': ['https://example.com'],  <--- These sites will not be traced if a request is sent to it.
        }
    }
    ```

You can find a Django sample application in the [Azure Monitor OpenCensus Python samples repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-monitor-opencensus-python/tree/master/azure_monitor/django_sample).

## Track Flask applications

1. Download and install `opencensus-ext-flask` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencensus-ext-flask/). Instrument your application with the `flask` middleware. Incoming requests sent to your Flask application are tracked.

    ```python
    
    from flask import Flask
    from opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter import AzureExporter
    from opencensus.ext.flask.flask_middleware import FlaskMiddleware
    from opencensus.trace.samplers import ProbabilitySampler
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    middleware = FlaskMiddleware(
        app,
        exporter=AzureExporter(connection_string="InstrumentationKey=<your-ikey-here>"),
        sampler=ProbabilitySampler(rate=1.0),
    )
    
    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello World!'
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(host='localhost', port=8080, threaded=True)
    
    ```

1. You can also configure your `flask` application through `app.config`. For requests from URLs that you don't want to track, add them to `EXCLUDELIST_PATHS`.

    ```python
    app.config['OPENCENSUS'] = {
        'TRACE': {
            'SAMPLER': 'opencensus.trace.samplers.ProbabilitySampler(rate=1.0)',
            'EXPORTER': '''opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter.AzureExporter(
                connection_string="InstrumentationKey=<your-ikey-here>",
            )''',
            'EXCLUDELIST_PATHS': ['https://example.com'],  <--- These sites will not be traced if a request is sent to it.
        }
    }
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > To run Flask under uWSGI in a Docker environment, you must first add `lazy-apps = true` to the uWSGI configuration file (uwsgi.ini). For more information, see the [issue description](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/issues/660).

You can find a Flask sample application that tracks requests in the [Azure Monitor OpenCensus Python samples repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-monitor-opencensus-python/tree/master/azure_monitor/flask_sample).

## Track Pyramid applications

1. Download and install `opencensus-ext-django` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencensus-ext-pyramid/). Instrument your application with the `pyramid` tween. Incoming requests sent to your Pyramid application are tracked.

    ```python
    def main(global_config, **settings):
        config = Configurator(settings=settings)
    
        config.add_tween('opencensus.ext.pyramid'
                         '.pyramid_middleware.OpenCensusTweenFactory')
    ```

1. You can configure your `pyramid` tween directly in the code. For requests from URLs that you don't want to track, add them to `EXCLUDELIST_PATHS`.

    ```python
    settings = {
        'OPENCENSUS': {
            'TRACE': {
                'SAMPLER': 'opencensus.trace.samplers.ProbabilitySampler(rate=1.0)',
                'EXPORTER': '''opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter.AzureExporter(
                    connection_string="InstrumentationKey=<your-ikey-here>",
                )''',
                'EXCLUDELIST_PATHS': ['https://example.com'],  <--- These sites will not be traced if a request is sent to it.
            }
        }
    }
    config = Configurator(settings=settings)
    ```

## Track FastAPI applications

1. The following dependencies are required:
    - [fastapi](https://pypi.org/project/fastapi/)
    - [uvicorn](https://pypi.org/project/uvicorn/)

      In a production setting, we recommend that you deploy [uvicorn with gunicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/deployment/#gunicorn).

2. Download and install `opencensus-ext-fastapi` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencensus-ext-fastapi/). 

    `pip install opencensus-ext-fastapi`

3. Instrument your application with the `fastapi` middleware.

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from opencensus.ext.fastapi.fastapi_middleware import FastAPIMiddleware

    app = FastAPI(__name__)
    app.add_middleware(FastAPIMiddleware)

    @app.get('/')
    def hello():
        return 'Hello World!'
    ```

4. Run your application. Calls made to your FastAPI application should be automatically tracked. Telemetry should be logged directly to Azure Monitor.
