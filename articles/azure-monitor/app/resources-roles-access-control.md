# Resources, roles, and access control in Application Insights

You can control who has read and update access to your data in [Application Insights][start] by using [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Assign access to users in the resource group or subscription to which your application resource belongs, not in the resource itself. Assign the Application Insights Component Contributor role. This role ensures uniform control of access to web tests and alerts along with your application resource. [Learn more](#access).

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Resources, groups, and subscriptions

First, let's define some terms:

* **Resource**: An instance of an Azure service. Your Application Insights resource collects, analyzes, and displays the telemetry data sent from your application. Other types of Azure resources include web apps, databases, and VMs.

    To see your resources, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), sign in, and select **All resources**. To find a resource, enter part of its name in the filter field.

<a name="resource-group"></a>

* [Resource group][group]: Every resource belongs to one group. A group is a convenient way to manage related resources, particularly for access control. For example, in one resource group you could put a web app, an Application Insights resource to monitor the app, and an Azure Storage resource to keep exported data.
* [Subscription](https://portal.azure.com): To use Application Insights or other Azure resources, you sign in to an Azure subscription. Every resource group belongs to one Azure subscription, where you choose your price package. If it's an organization subscription, the owner can choose the members and their access permissions.
* [Microsoft account][account]: The username and password that you use to sign in to Azure subscriptions, Xbox Live, Outlook.com, and other Microsoft services.

## <a name="access"></a> Control access in the resource group

Along with the resource you created for your application, there are also separate hidden resources for alerts and web tests. They're attached to the same [resource group](#resource-group) as your Application Insights resource. You might also have put other Azure services in there, such as websites or storage.

## Provide access to another user

You must have Owner rights to the subscription or the resource group.

The user must have a [Microsoft account][account] or access to their [organizational Microsoft account](../../active-directory/fundamentals/sign-up-organization.md). You can provide access to individuals and also to user groups defined in Azure Active Directory.

#### Go to a resource group or directly to the resource itself

Assign the Contributor role to Azure RBAC.

For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles by using the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

#### Select the user

If the user you want isn't in the directory, you can invite anyone with a Microsoft account. If they use services like Outlook.com, OneDrive, Windows Phone, or Xbox Live, they have a Microsoft account.

## PowerShell query to determine role membership

Because certain roles can be linked to notifications and email alerts, it can be helpful to be able to generate a list of users who belong to a given role. To help with generating these types of lists, the following sample queries can be adjusted to fit your specific needs.

### Query entire subscription for Admin roles + Contributor roles

```powershell
(Get-AzRoleAssignment -IncludeClassicAdministrators | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -in @('ServiceAdministrator', 'CoAdministrator', 'Owner', 'Contributor') } | Select -ExpandProperty SignInName | Sort-Object -Unique) -Join ", "
```

### Query within the context of a specific Application Insights resource for owners and contributors

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "RGNAME"
$resourceName = "AppInsightsName"
$resourceType = "microsoft.insights/components"
(Get-AzRoleAssignment -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup -ResourceType $resourceType -ResourceName $resourceName | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -in @('Owner', 'Contributor') } | Select -ExpandProperty SignInName | Sort-Object -Unique) -Join ", "
```

### Query within the context of a specific resource group for owners and contributors

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "RGNAME"
(Get-AzRoleAssignment -ResourceGroup $resourceGroup | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -in @('Owner', 'Contributor') } | Select -ExpandProperty SignInName | Sort-Object -Unique) -Join ", "
```
