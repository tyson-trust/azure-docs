# Create and manage a dedicated cluster in Azure Monitor Logs 

Linking a Log Analytics workspace to a dedicated cluster in Azure Monitor provides advanced capabilities and higher query utilization. Clusters require a minimum ingestion commitment of 500 GB per day. You can link and unlink workspaces from a dedicated cluster without any data loss or service interruption. 

## Advanced capabilities
Capabilities that require dedicated clusters:

- **[Customer-managed keys](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md)** - Encrypt cluster data using keys that you provide and control.
- **[Lockbox](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md#customer-lockbox)** - Control Microsoft support engineer access requests to your data.
- **[Double encryption](../../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md#doubly-encrypt-data-with-infrastructure-encryption)** - Protect against a scenario where one of the encryption algorithms or keys may be compromised. In this case, the extra layer of encryption continues to protect your data.
- **[Cross-query optimization](../logs/cross-workspace-query.md)** - Cross-workspace queries run faster when workspaces are on the same cluster.
- **Cost optimization** - Link your workspaces in same region to cluster to get commitment tier discount to all workspaces, even to ones with low ingestion that 
eligible for commitment tier discount.
- **[Availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md)** - Protect your data from datacenter failures by relying on datacenters in different physical locations, equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. The physical separation in zones and independent infrastructure makes an incident far less likely since the workspace can rely on the resources from any of the zones. [Azure Monitor availability zones](./availability-zones.md#service-resilience---supported-regions) covers broader parts of the service and when available in your region, extends your Azure Monitor resilience automatically. Azure Monitor creates dedicated clusters as availability-zone-enabled (`isAvailabilityZonesEnabled`: 'true') by default in supported regions. [Dedicated clusters Availability zones](./availability-zones.md#data-resilience---supported-regions) aren't supported in all regions currently.
- **[Ingest from Azure Event Hubs](../logs/ingest-logs-event-hub.md)** - Lets you ingest data directly from an Event Bubs into a Log Analytics workspace. Dedicated cluster lets you use capability when ingestion from all linked workspaces combined meet commitment tier. 

## Cluster pricing model
Log Analytics Dedicated Clusters use a commitment tier pricing model of at least 500 GB/day. Any usage above the tier level incurs charges based on the per-GB rate of that commitment tier. See [Azure Monitor Logs pricing details](cost-logs.md#dedicated-clusters) for pricing details for dedicated clusters. The commitment tiers have a 31-day commitment period from the time a commitment tier is selected.

## Required permissions

To perform cluster-related actions, you need these permissions:

| Action | Permissions or role needed |
|-|-|
| Create a dedicate cluster |`Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*`and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write`| 
| Change cluster properties |`Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write`| 
| Link workspaces to a cluster | `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write` and `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write`| 
| Grant the required permissions | Owner or Contributor role that has `*/write` permissions, or a Log Analytics Contributor role that has `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/*` permissions.| 

For more information on Log Analytics permissions, see [Manage access to log data and workspaces in Azure Monitor](./manage-access.md). 

## Create a dedicated cluster

Provide the following properties when creating new dedicated cluster:

- **ClusterName**: Must be unique for the resource group.
- **ResourceGroupName**: Use a central IT resource group because many teams in the organization usually share clusters. For more design considerations, review Design a Log Analytics workspace configuration(../logs/workspace-design.md).
- **Location**
- **SkuCapacity**: You can set the commitment tier (formerly called capacity reservations) to 500, 1000, 2000 or 5000 GB/day. For more information on cluster costs, see [Dedicate clusters](./cost-logs.md#dedicated-clusters). 
- **Managed identity**: Clusters support two [managed identity types](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md#managed-identity-types): 
  - System-assigned managed identity - Generated automatically with the cluster creation when identity `type` is set to "*SystemAssigned*". This identity can be used later to grant storage access to your Key Vault for wrap and unwrap operations.

    *Identity in Cluster's REST Call*
    ```json
    {
      "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned"
        }
    }
    ```
  - User-assigned managed identity - Lets you configure a customer-managed key at cluster creation, when granting it permissions in your Key Vault before cluster creation.

    *Identity in Cluster's REST Call*
    ```json
    {
    "identity": {
      "type": "UserAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
          "subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/UserAssignedIdentities/<cluster-assigned-managed-identity>"
        }
      }  
    }
    ```

After you create your cluster resource, you can edit properties such as *sku*, *keyVaultProperties, or *billingType*. See more details below.

Deleted clusters take two weeks to be completely removed. You can have up to seven clusters per subscription and region, five active, and two deleted in past two weeks.

> [!NOTE]
> Cluster creation triggers resource allocation and provisioning. This operation can take a few hours to complete.
> Dedicated cluster is billed once provisioned regardless data ingestion and it's recommended to prepare the deployment to expedite the provisioning and workspaces link to cluster. Verify the following:
> - A list of initial workspace to be linked to cluster is identified
> - You have permissions to subscription intended for the cluster and any workspace to be linked

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics cluster create --no-wait --resource-group "resource-group-name" --name "cluster-name" --location "region-name" --sku-capacity "daily-ingestion-gigabyte"

# Wait for job completion when `--no-wait` was used
$clusterResourceId = az monitor log-analytics cluster list --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "[?contains(name, 'cluster-name')].[id]" --output tsv
az resource wait --created --ids $clusterResourceId --include-response-body true
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

New-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name" -Location "region-name" -SkuCapacity "daily-ingestion-gigabyte" -AsJob

# Check when the job is done when `-AsJob` was used
Get-Job -Command "New-AzOperationalInsightsCluster*" | Format-List -Property *
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

*Call* 

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/<cluster-name>?api-version=2021-06-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-type: application/json

{
  "identity": {
    "type": "systemAssigned"
    },
  "sku": {
    "name": "capacityReservation",
    "Capacity": 500
    },
  "properties": {
    "billingType": "Cluster",
    },
  "location": "<region>",
}
```

*Response*

Should be 202 (Accepted) and a header.

---

### Check cluster provisioning status

The provisioning of the Log Analytics cluster takes a while to complete. Use one of the following methods to check the *ProvisioningState* property. The value is *ProvisioningAccount* while provisioning and *Succeeded* when completed.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics cluster show --resource-group "resource-group-name" --name "cluster-name"
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

Get-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name"
```
 
#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Send a GET request on the cluster resource and look at the *provisioningState* value. The value is *ProvisioningAccount* while provisioning and *Succeeded* when completed.

  ```rest
  GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/subscription-id/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/cluster-name?api-version=2021-06-01
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

  **Response**

  ```json
  {
    "identity": {
      "type": "SystemAssigned",
      "tenantId": "tenant-id",
      "principalId": "principal-id"
    },
    "sku": {
      "name": "capacityreservation",
      "capacity": 500
    },
    "properties": {
      "provisioningState": "ProvisioningAccount",
      "clusterId": "cluster-id",
      "billingType": "Cluster",
      "lastModifiedDate": "last-modified-date",
      "createdDate": "created-date",
      "isDoubleEncryptionEnabled": false,
      "isAvailabilityZonesEnabled": false,
      "capacityReservationProperties": {
        "lastSkuUpdate": "last-sku-modified-date",
        "minCapacity": 500
      }
    },
    "id": "/subscriptions/subscription-id/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/cluster-name",
    "name": "cluster-name",
    "type": "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters",
    "location": "cluster-region"
  }
  ```

The managed identity service generates the *principalId* GUID when you create the cluster.

## Link a workspace to a cluster

When a Log Analytics workspace is linked to a dedicated cluster, the workspace billing plan in workspace is changed to cluster plan, new data ingested to the workspace is routed to your dedicated cluster, and existing data remains in Log Analytics cluster. Linking a workspace has no effect on data ingestion and query experiences. Log Analytics query engine stitches data from old and new clusters automatically, and the results of queries are complete and accurate. 
 
When dedicated cluster is configured with customer-managed key (CMK), new ingested data is encrypted with your key, while older data remains encrypted with Microsoft-managed key (MMK). The key configuration is abstracted by Log Analytics and the query across old and new data encryptions is performed seamlessly.

A cluster can be linked to up to 1,000 workspaces. Linked workspaces can be located in the same region as the cluster. A workspace can't be linked to a cluster more than twice a month, to prevent data fragmentation.

You need 'write' permissions to both the workspace and the cluster resource for workspace link operation:

- In the workspace: *Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/write*
- In the cluster resource: *Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/write*

Other than the billing aspects that is governed by the cluster plan, the linked workspace configuration remain.

The workspace and the cluster can be in different subscriptions. It's possible for the workspace and cluster to be in different tenants if Azure Lighthouse is used to map both of them to a single tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> Linking a workspace can be performed only after the completion of the Log Analytics cluster provisioning.
> Linking a workspace to a cluster involves syncing multiple backend components and cache hydration, which can take up to two hours.

Use the following commands to link a workspace to a cluster:

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
# Find cluster resource ID
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"
$clusterResourceId = az monitor log-analytics cluster list --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "[?contains(name, 'cluster-name')].[id]" --output tsv

# Link workspace
az account set --subscription "workspace-subscription-id"
az monitor log-analytics workspace linked-service create --no-wait --name cluster --resource-group "resource-group-name" --workspace-name "workspace-name" --write-access-resource-id $clusterResourceId

# Wait for job completion when `--no-wait` was used
$workspaceResourceId = az monitor log-analytics workspace list --resource-group "resource-group-name" --query "[?contains(name, 'workspace-name')].[id]" --output tsv
az resource wait --deleted --ids $workspaceResourceId --include-response-body true
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

# Find cluster resource ID
$clusterResourceId = (Get-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name").id

Select-AzSubscription "workspace-subscription-id"

# Link the workspace to the cluster
Set-AzOperationalInsightsLinkedService -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -WorkspaceName "workspace-name" -LinkedServiceName cluster -WriteAccessResourceId $clusterResourceId -AsJob

# Check when the job is done
Get-Job -Command "Set-AzOperationalInsightsLinkedService" | Format-List -Property *
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Use the following REST call to link to a cluster:

*Send*

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/<workspace-name>/linkedservices/cluster?api-version=2021-06-01 
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-type: application/json

{
  "properties": {
    "WriteAccessResourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/clusters/<cluster-name>"
    }
}
```

*Response*

202 (Accepted) and header.

---

### Check workspace link status
  
When a cluster is configured with customer-managed keys, data ingested to the workspaces after the link operation completion is stored encrypted with your managed key. The workspace link operation can take up to 90 minutes to complete and you can check the state by sending Get request to workspace and observe if *clusterResourceId* property is present in the response under *features*.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "workspace-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics workspace show --resource-group "resource-group-name" --workspace-name "workspace-name"
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "workspace-subscription-id"

Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -Name "workspace-name"
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

*Call*

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/<workspace-name>?api-version=2021-06-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

*Response*

```json

## Change cluster properties

After you create your cluster resource and it's fully provisioned, you can edit cluster properties using CLI, PowerShell or REST API. Properties you can set after the cluster is provisioned include:

- **keyVaultProperties** - Contains the key in Azure Key Vault with the following parameters: *KeyVaultUri*, *KeyName*, *KeyVersion*. See [Update cluster with Key identifier details](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md#update-cluster-with-key-identifier-details).
- **Identity** - The identity used to authenticate to your Key Vault. This can be System-assigned or User-assigned.
- **billingType** - Billing attribution for the cluster resource and its data. Includes on the following values:
  - **Cluster (default)**--The costs for your cluster are attributed to the cluster resource.
  - **Workspaces**--The costs for your cluster are attributed proportionately to the workspaces in the Cluster, with the cluster resource being billed some of the usage if the total ingested data for the day is under the commitment tier. See [Log Analytics Dedicated Clusters](./cost-logs.md#dedicated-clusters) to learn more about the cluster pricing model.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>Cluster update should not include both identity and key identifier details in the same operation. If you need to update both, the update should be in two consecutive operations.

> [!NOTE]
> The *billingType* property isn't supported in CLI.

## Get all clusters in resource group

```rest
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourcegroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters?api-version=2021-06-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

*Response*
  
```json

Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
    
*Response*
    
The same as for 'clusters in a resource group', but in subscription scope.

---


## Update commitment tier in cluster

When the data volume to linked workspaces changes over time, you can update the Commitment Tier level appropriately to optimize cost. The tier is specified in units of Gigabytes (GB) and can have values of 500, 1000, 2000 or 5000 GB per day. You don't have to provide the full REST request body, but you must include the sku.

During the commitment period, you can change to a higher commitment tier, which restarts the 31-day commitment period. You can't move back to pay-as-you-go or to a lower commitment tier until after you finish the commitment period.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics cluster update --resource-group "resource-group-name" --name "cluster-name"  --sku-capacity 500
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

Update-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name" -SkuCapacity 500
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

*Call*

```rest
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/<cluster-name>?api-version=2021-06-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-type: application/json

{
  "sku": {
    "name": "capacityReservation",
    "Capacity": 2000
  }
}
```

---


### Update billingType in cluster

The *billingType* property determines the billing attribution for the cluster and its data:
- *Cluster* (default) -- billing is attributed to the Cluster resource
- *Workspaces* -- billing is attributed to linked workspaces proportionally. When data volume from all linked workspaces is below Commitment Tier level, the bill for the remaining volume is attributed to the cluster

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

N/A

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

Update-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name" -BillingType "Workspaces"
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

*Call*

```rest
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/<cluster-name>?api-version=2021-06-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-type: application/json

{
  "properties": {
    "billingType": "Workspaces"
    },
    "location": "region"
}
```

---

### Unlink a workspace from cluster

You can unlink a workspace from a cluster at any time. The workspace pricing tier is changed to per-GB, data ingested to cluster before the unlink operation remains in the cluster, and new data to workspace get ingested to Log Analytics.

> [!WARNING]
> Unlinking a workspace does not move workspace data out of the cluster. Any data collected for workspace while linked to cluster, remains in cluster for the retention period defined in workspace, and accessible as long as cluster isn't deleted.

Queries aren't affected when workspace is unlinked and service performs cross-cluster queries seamlessly. If cluster was configured with Customer-managed key (CMK), data ingested to workspace while was linked, remains encrypted with your key and accessible, while your key and permissions to Key Vault remain.

> [!NOTE] 
> - There is a limit of two link operations for a specific workspace within a month to prevent data distribution across clusters. Contact support if you reach the limit.
> - Unlinked workspaces are moved to Pay-As-You-Go pricing tier.

Use the following commands to unlink a workspace from cluster:

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "workspace-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics workspace linked-service delete --resource-group "resource-group-name" --workspace-name "workspace-name" --name cluster
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "workspace-subscription-id"

# Unlink a workspace from cluster
Remove-AzOperationalInsightsLinkedService -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -WorkspaceName {workspace-name} -LinkedServiceName cluster
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

N/A

---


## Delete cluster

You need to have *write* permissions on the cluster resource. 

Cluster deletion operation should be done with caution, since operation is non-recoverable. All ingested data to cluster from linked workspaces, gets permanently deleted. 

The cluster's billing stops when cluster is deleted, regardless of the 31-days commitment tier defined in cluster.

If you delete a cluster that has linked workspaces, workspaces get automatically unlinked from the cluster, workspaces are moved to Pay-As-You-Go pricing tier, and new data to workspaces is ingested to Log Analytics clusters instead. You can query workspace for the time range before it was linked to the cluster, and after the unlink, and the service performs cross-cluster queries seamlessly.

> [!NOTE] 
> - There is a limit of seven clusters per subscription and region, five active, plus two that were deleted in past two weeks.
> - Cluster's name remain reserved two weeks after deletion, and can't be used for creating a new cluster.

Use the following commands to delete a cluster:

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription "cluster-subscription-id"

az monitor log-analytics cluster delete --resource-group "resource-group-name" --name $clusterName
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Select-AzSubscription "cluster-subscription-id"

Remove-AzOperationalInsightsCluster -ResourceGroupName "resource-group-name" -ClusterName "cluster-name"
```

#### [REST API](#tab/restapi)

Use the following REST call to delete a cluster:

```rest
DELETE https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/clusters/<cluster-name>?api-version=2021-06-01
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

  **Response**

  200 OK

---



## Limits and constraints

- A maximum of five active clusters can be created in each region and subscription.

- A maximum of seven clusters allowed per subscription and region, five active, plus two that were deleted in past 2 weeks.

- A maximum of 1,000 Log Analytics workspaces can be linked to a cluster.

- A maximum of two workspace link operations on particular workspace is allowed in 30 day period.

- Moving a cluster to another resource group or subscription isn't currently supported.

- Cluster update shouldn't include both identity and key identifier details in the same operation. In case you need to update both, the update should be in two consecutive operations.

- Lockbox isn't currently available in China. 

- [Double encryption](../../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md#doubly-encrypt-data-with-infrastructure-encryption) is configured automatically for clusters created from October 2020 in supported regions. You can verify if your cluster is configured for double encryption by sending a GET request on the cluster and observing that the `isDoubleEncryptionEnabled` value is `true` for clusters with Double encryption enabled. 
  - If you create a cluster and get an error "region-name doesn't support Double Encryption for clusters.", you can still create the cluster without Double encryption by adding `"properties": {"isDoubleEncryptionEnabled": false}` in the REST request body.
  - Double encryption setting can't be changed after the cluster has been created.

- Deleting a workspace is permitted while linked to cluster. If you decide to [recover](./delete-workspace.md#recover-a-workspace) the workspace during the [soft-delete](./delete-workspace.md#soft-delete-behavior) period, workspace returns to previous state and remains linked to cluster.

- During the commitment period, you can change to a higher commitment tier, which restarts the 31-day commitment period. You can't move back to pay-as-you-go or to a lower commitment tier until after you finish the commitment period.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get conflict error when creating a cluster, it might have been deleted in past 2 weeks and in deletion process yet. The cluster name remains reserved during the 2 weeks deletion period and you can't create a new cluster with that name.

- If you update your cluster while the cluster is at provisioning or updating state, the update will fail.

- Some operations are long and can take a while to complete. These are *cluster create*, *cluster key update* and *cluster delete*. You can check the operation status by sending GET request to cluster or workspace and observe the response. For example, unlinked workspace won't have the *clusterResourceId* under *features*.

- If you attempt to link a Log Analytics workspace that's already linked to another cluster, the operation will fail.

## Error messages
  
### Cluster Create

-  400--Cluster name isn't valid. Cluster name can contain characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and length of 3-63.
-  400--The body of the request is null or in bad format.
-  400--SKU name is invalid. Set SKU name to capacityReservation.
-  400--Capacity was provided but SKU isn't capacityReservation. Set SKU name to capacityReservation.
