# Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure Monitor

This article describes how to use Azure Monitor to monitor the health and performance of [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../../aks/intro-kubernetes.md). It includes collection of telemetry critical for monitoring, analysis and visualization of collected data to identify trends, and how to configure alerting to be proactively notified of critical issues.

The [Cloud Monitoring Guide](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/monitor/) defines the [primary monitoring objectives](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/monitoring-strategy#formulate-monitoring-requirements) you should focus on for your Azure resources. This scenario focuses on health and status monitoring using Azure Monitor.

## Scope of the scenario

This article does *not* include information on the following scenarios:

- Monitoring of Kubernetes clusters outside of Azure except for referring to existing content for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes
- Monitoring of AKS with tools other than Azure Monitor except to fill gaps in Azure Monitor and Container Insights

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor was designed to monitor the availability and performance of cloud resources. While the operational data stored in Azure Monitor may be useful for investigating security incidents, other services in Azure were designed to monitor security. Security monitoring for AKS is done with [Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/overview.md) and [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction.md). See [Monitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor - Security monitoring](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-security.md) for a description of the security monitoring tools in Azure and their relationship to Azure Monitor.
>
> For information on using the security services to monitor AKS, see [Microsoft Defender for Kubernetes - the benefits and features](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-kubernetes-introduction.md) and  [Connect Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) diagnostics logs to Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/data-connectors/azure-kubernetes-service-aks.md).

## Container Insights

AKS generates [platform metrics and resource logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md) that you can use to monitor basic health and performance. Enable [Container Insights](container-insights-overview.md) to expand on this monitoring. Container Insights is a feature in Azure Monitor that monitors the health and performance of managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on AKS and provides interactive views and workbooks that analyze collected data for a variety of monitoring scenarios.

[Prometheus](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio) and [Grafana](https://aka.ms/azureprometheus-promio-grafana) are popular CNCF-backed open-source tools for Kubernetes monitoring. AKS exposes many metrics in Prometheus format, which makes Prometheus a popular choice for monitoring. [Container Insights](container-insights-overview.md) has native integration with AKS, like collecting critical metrics and logs, alerting on identified issues, and providing visualization with workbooks. It also collects certain Prometheus metrics. Many native Azure Monitor insights are built on top of Prometheus metrics. Container Insights complements and completes E2E monitoring of AKS, including log collection, which Prometheus as stand-alone tool doesnâ€™t provide. You can use Prometheus integration and Azure Monitor together for E2E monitoring.

To learn more about using Container Insights, see the [Container Insights overview](container-insights-overview.md). To learn more about features and monitoring scenarios of Container Insights, see [Monitor layers of AKS with Container Insights](#monitor-layers-of-aks-with-container-insights).

## Configure monitoring

The following sections describe the steps required to configure full monitoring of your AKS cluster using Azure Monitor.

### Create Log Analytics workspace

You need at least one Log Analytics workspace to support Container Insights and to collect and analyze other telemetry about your AKS cluster. There's no cost for the workspace, but you do incur ingestion and retention costs when you collect data. See [Azure Monitor Logs pricing details](../logs/cost-logs.md) for details.

If you're just getting started with Azure Monitor, we recommend starting with a single workspace and creating additional workspaces as your requirements evolve. Many environments will use a single workspace for all the Azure resources they monitor. You can even share a workspace used by [Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-security.md), although it's common to segregate availability and performance telemetry from security data.

For information on design considerations for a workspace configuration, see [Designing your Azure Monitor Logs deployment](../logs/workspace-design.md).

### Enable Container Insights

When you enable Container Insights for your AKS cluster, it deploys a containerized version of the [Log Analytics agent](../agents/../agents/log-analytics-agent.md) that sends data to Azure Monitor. For prerequisites and configuration options, see [Enable Container Insights](container-insights-onboard.md).

### Configure collection from Prometheus

Container Insights allows you to send Prometheus metrics to [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](../essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md) or to your Log Analytics workspace without requiring a local Prometheus server. You can analyze this data using Azure Monitor features along with other data collected by Container Insights. For details on this configuration, see [Collect Prometheus metrics with Container Insights](container-insights-prometheus.md).

### Collect resource logs

The logs for AKS control plane components are implemented in Azure as [resource logs](../essentials/resource-logs.md). Container Insights doesn't use these logs, so you need to create your own log queries to view and analyze them. For details on log structure and queries, see [How to query logs from Container Insights](container-insights-log-query.md#resource-logs).

You need to create a diagnostic setting to collect resource logs. You can create multiple diagnostic settings to send different sets of logs to different locations. To create diagnostic settings for your AKS cluster, see [Create diagnostic settings to send platform logs and metrics to different destinations](../essentials/diagnostic-settings.md).

There's a cost for sending resource logs to a workspace, so you should only collect those log categories that you intend to use. Start by collecting a minimal number of categories and then modify the diagnostic setting to collect additional categories as your needs increase and as you understand your associated costs. You can send logs to an Azure storage account to reduce costs if you need to retain the information. For a description of the categories that are available for AKS, see [Resource logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs). For details on the cost of ingesting and retaining log data, see [Azure Monitor Logs pricing details](../logs/cost-logs.md).

If you're unsure which resource logs to initially enable, use the following recommendations:

| Category | Enable? | Destination |
|:---|:---|:---|
| cluster-autoscaler      | Enable if autoscale is enabled | Log Analytics workspace |
| guard                   | Enable if Azure Active Directory is enabled | Log Analytics workspace |
| kube-apiserver          | Enable | Log Analytics workspace |
| kube-audit              | Enable | Azure storage. This keeps costs to a minimum yet retains the audit logs if they're required by an auditor. |
| kube-audit-admin        | Enable | Log Analytics workspace |
| kube-controller-manager | Enable | Log Analytics workspace |
| kube-scheduler          | Disable | |
| AllMetrics              | Enable | Log Analytics workspace |

The recommendations are based on the most common customer requirements. You can enable other categories later if you need to.

## Access Azure Monitor features

Access Azure Monitor features for all AKS clusters in your subscription from the **Monitoring** menu in the Azure portal, or for a single AKS cluster from the **Monitor** section of the **Kubernetes services** menu. The following image shows the **Monitoring** menu for your AKS cluster:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/monitoring-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of AKS Monitoring menu." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/monitoring-menu.png":::

| Menu option | Description |

## Monitor layers of AKS with Container Insights

Your monitoring approach should be based on your unique workload requirements, and factors such as scale, topology, organizational roles, and multi-cluster tenancy. This section presents a common bottoms-up approach, starting from infrastructure up through applications. Each layer has distinct monitoring requirements.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/layers.png" alt-text="Diagram of different AKS layers."  border="false":::

### Level 1 - Cluster level components

The cluster level includes the following component:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Node |  Understand the readiness status and performance of CPU, memory, disk and IP usage for each node and proactively monitor their usage trends before deploying any workloads. |

Use existing views and reports in Container Insights to monitor cluster level components.

- Use the **Cluster** view to see the performance of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU and memory utilization.
- Use the **Nodes** view to see the health of each node and the health and performance of the pods running on them. For more information on analyzing node health and performance, see [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container Insights](container-insights-analyze.md).
- Under **Reports**, use the **Node Monitoring** workbooks to analyze disk capacity, disk IO, and GPU usage. For more information about these workbooks, see [Node Monitoring workbooks](container-insights-reports.md#node-monitoring-workbooks).

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-cluster-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container Insights cluster view." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-cluster-view.png":::

- Under **Monitoring**, you can select **Workbooks**, then **Subnet IP Usage** to see the IP allocation and assignment on each node for a selected time-range.

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/monitoring-workbooks-subnet-ip-usage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container Insights workbooks." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/monitoring-workbooks-subnet-ip-usage.png":::

For troubleshooting scenarios, you may need to access the AKS nodes directly for maintenance or immediate log collection. For security purposes, the AKS nodes aren't exposed to the internet but you can use the `kubectl debug` command to SSH to the AKS nodes. For more information on this process, see [Connect with SSH to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes for maintenance or troubleshooting](../../aks/ssh.md).

### Level 2 - Managed AKS components

The managed AKS level includes the following components:

| Component | Monitoring |
|:---|:---|
| API Server | Monitor the status of API server and identify any increase in request load and bottlenecks if the service is down. |
| Kubelet | Monitor Kubelet to help troubleshoot pod management issues, pods not starting, nodes not ready, or pods getting killed.  |

Azure Monitor and Container Insights don't provide full monitoring for the API server.

- Under **Monitoring**, you can select **Metrics** to view the **Inflight Requests** counter, but you should refer to metrics in Prometheus for a complete view of the API server performance. This includes such values as request latency and workqueue processing time.
- To see critical metrics for the API server, see [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12006) to set up a dashboard on your existing Grafana server or set up a new Grafana server in Azure using [Monitor your Azure services in Grafana](../visualize/grafana-plugin.md).

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/grafana-api-server.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dashboard for Grafana API server." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/grafana-api-server.png":::

- Under **Reports**, use the **Kubelet** workbook to see the health and performance of each kubelet. For more information about these workbooks, see [Resource Monitoring workbooks](container-insights-reports.md#resource-monitoring-workbooks). For troubleshooting scenarios, you can access kubelet logs using the process described at [Get kubelet logs from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes](../../aks/kubelet-logs.md).

### Resource logs

Use [log queries with resource logs](container-insights-log-query.md#resource-logs) to analyze control plane logs generated by AKS components.

### Level 3 - Kubernetes objects and workloads

The Kubernetes objects and workloads level includes the following components:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Deployments | Monitor actual vs desired state of the deployment and the status and resource utilization of the pods running on them.  |
| Pods | Monitor status and resource utilization, including CPU and memory, of the pods running on your AKS cluster. |
| Containers | Monitor resource utilization, including CPU and memory, of the containers running on your AKS cluster. |

Use existing views and reports in Container Insights to monitor containers and pods.

- Use the **Nodes** and **Controllers** views to see the health and performance of the pods running on them and drill down to the health and performance of their containers.
- Use the **Containers** view to see the health and performance for the containers. For more information on analyzing container health and performance, see [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container Insights](container-insights-analyze.md#analyze-nodes-controllers-and-container-health).

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-containers-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container Insights containers view." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-containers-view.png":::

- Under **Reports**, use the **Deployments** workbook to see deployment metrics. For more information, ee [Deployment & HPA metrics with Container Insights](container-insights-deployment-hpa-metrics.md).

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-deployments-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container Insights deployments workbook." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-deployments-workbook.png":::

#### Live data

In troubleshooting scenarios, Container Insights provides access to live AKS container logs (stdout/stderror), events and pod metrics. For more information about this feature, see [How to view Kubernetes logs, events, and pod metrics in real-time](container-insights-livedata-overview.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-live-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Container insights live data." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/container-insights-live-data.png":::

### Level 4 - Applications

The application level includes the following component:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Applications | Monitor microservice application deployments to identify application failures and latency issues, including information like request rates, response times, and exceptions. |

Application Insights provides complete monitoring of applications running on AKS and other environments. If you have a Java application, you can provide monitoring without instrumenting your code by following [Zero instrumentation application monitoring for Kubernetes - Azure Monitor Application Insights](../app/kubernetes-codeless.md).

If you want complete monitoring, you should configure code-based monitoring depending on your application:

- [ASP.NET applications](../app/asp-net.md)
- [ASP.NET Core applications](../app/asp-net-core.md)
- [.NET Console applications](../app/console.md)
- [Java](../app/opentelemetry-enable.md?tabs=java)
- [Node.js](../app/nodejs.md)
- [Python](../app/opencensus-python.md)
- [Other platforms](../app/app-insights-overview.md#supported-languages)

For more information, see [What is Application Insights?](../app/app-insights-overview.md).

### Level 5 - External components

The components external to AKS include the following:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Service Mesh, Ingress, Egress | Metrics based on component. |
| Database and work queues | Metrics based on component. |

Monitor external components such as Service Mesh, Ingress, Egress with Prometheus and Grafana, or other proprietary tools. Monitor databases and other Azure resources using other features of Azure Monitor.

## Analyze metric data with the Metrics explorer

Use the **Metrics** explorer to perform custom analysis of metric data collected for your containers. It allows you plot charts, visually correlate trends, and investigate spikes and dips in your metrics values. You can create metrics alert to proactively notify you when a metric value crosses a threshold and pin charts to dashboards for use by different members of your organization.

For more information, see [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../essentials/metrics-getting-started.md). For a list of the platform metrics collected for AKS, see [Monitoring AKS data reference metrics](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics). When Container Insights is enabled for a cluster, [addition metric values](container-insights-update-metrics.md) are available.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-kubernetes/metrics-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Metrics explorer." lightbox="media/monitor-kubernetes/metrics-explorer.png":::

## Analyze log data with Log Analytics

Select **Logs** to use the Log Analytics tool to analyze resource logs or dig deeper into data used to create the views in Container Insights. Log Analytics allows you to perform custom analysis of your log data.

For more information on Log Analytics and to get started with it, see:

- [How to query logs from Container Insights](container-insights-log-query.md)
- [Using queries in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../logs/queries.md)
- [Monitoring AKS data reference logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)
- [Log Analytics tutorial](../logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md)

You can also use log queries to analyze resource logs from AKS. For a list of the log categories available, see [AKS data reference resource logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs). You must create a diagnostic setting to collect each category as described in [Configure monitoring](#configure-monitoring) before the data can be collected.

## Alerts

[Alerts in Azure Monitor](../alerts/alerts-overview.md) proactively notify you of interesting data and patterns in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. There are no preconfigured alert rules for AKS clusters, but you can create your own based on data collected by Container Insights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most alert rules have a cost dependent on the type of rule, how many dimensions it includes, and how frequently it runs. Refer to **Alert rules** in [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) before creating any alert rules.

### Choose an alert type

The most common types of alert rules in Azure Monitor are [metric alerts](../alerts/alerts-metric.md) and [log query alerts](../alerts/alerts-log-query.md). The type of alert rule that you create for a particular scenario will depend on where the data is located that you want to set an alert for.

You may have cases where data for a particular alerting scenario is available in both **Metrics** and **Logs**, and you need to determine which rule type to use. It's typically the best strategy to use metric alerts instead of log alerts when possible, because metric alerts are more responsive and stateful. You can create a metric alert on any values you can analyze in the Metrics explorer. If the logic for your alert rule requires data in **Logs**, or if it requires more complex logic, then you can use a log query alert rule.

For example, if you want an alert when an application workload is consuming excessive CPU, you can create a metric alert using the CPU metric. If you need an alert when a particular message is found in a control plane log, then you'll require a log alert.

### Metric alert rules

Metric alert rules use the same metric values as the Metrics explorer. In fact, you can create an alert rule directly from the metrics explorer with the data you're currently analyzing. You can use any of the values in [AKS data reference metrics](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics) for metric alert rules.

Container Insights includes a feature that creates a recommended set of metric alert rules for your AKS cluster. This feature creates new metric values used by the alert rules that you can also use in the Metrics explorer. For more information, see [Recommended metric alerts (preview) from Container Insights](container-insights-metric-alerts.md).

### Log alert rules

Use log alert rules to generate an alert from the results of a log query. This may be data collected by Container Insights or from AKS resource logs. For more information, see [How to create log alerts from Container Insights](container-insights-log-alerts.md) and [How to query logs from Container Insights](container-insights-log-query.md).

### Virtual machine alerts

AKS relies on a Virtual Machine Scale Set that must be healthy to run AKS workloads. You can alert on critical metrics such as CPU, memory, and storage for the virtual machines using the guidance at [Monitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Alerts](../vm/monitor-virtual-machine-alerts.md).

### Prometheus alerts

You can configure Prometheus alerts to cover scenarios where Azure Monitor either doesn't have the data required for an alerting condition or the alerting may not be responsive enough. For example, Azure Monitor doesn't collect critical information for the API server. You can create a log query alert using the data from the kube-apiserver resource log category, but it can take up to several minutes before you receive an alert, which may not be sufficient for your requirements. In this case, we recommend configuring Prometheus alerts.
