# Prometheus alerts in Azure Monitor
Prometheus alert rules allow you to define alert conditions, using queries which are written in Prometheus Query Language (Prom QL). The rule queries are applied on Prometheus metrics stored in [Azure Monitor managed services for Prometheus](../essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md). Whenever the alert query results in one or more time series meeting the condition, the alert counts as pending for these metric and label sets. A pending alert becomes active after a user-defined period of time during which all the consecutive query evaluations for the respective time series meet the alert condition. Once an alert becomes active, it is fired and would trigger your actions or notifications of choice, as defined in the Azure Action Groups configured in your alert rule.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus, including Prometheus metrics, is currently in public preview and does not yet have all of its features enabled. Prometheus metrics are displayed with alerts generated by other types of alert rules, but they currently have a difference experience for creating and managing them.

## Create Prometheus alert rule
Prometheus alert rules are created as part of a Prometheus rule group, which is applied on the [Azure Monitor workspace](../essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). See [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus rule groups](../essentials/prometheus-rule-groups.md) for details.

## View Prometheus alerts
View fired and resolved Prometheus alerts in the Azure portal with other alert types. Use the following steps to filter on only Prometheus alerts.
1. From the **Monitor** menu in the Azure portal, select **Alerts**.
2. If **Monitoring Service** isn't displayed as a filter option, then select **Add Filter** and add it.
3. Set the filter **Monitoring Service** to **Prometheus** to see Prometheus alerts.

4. Click the alert name to view the details of a specific fired/resolved alert.

## Explore Prometheus alerts in Grafana
1. In the fired alerts details pane, you can click the **View query in Grafana** link. 
2. A browser tab will be opened taking you to the [Azure Managed Grafana](../../managed-grafana/overview.md) instance connected to your Azure Monitor Workspace. 
3. Grafana will be opened in Explore mode, presenting the chart for your alert rule expression query which triggered the alert, around the alert firing time. You can further explore the query in Grafana to identify the reason causing the alert to fire.

> [!NOTE]
> 1. If there is no Azure Managed Grafana connected to your Azure Monitor Workspace, a link to Grafana will not be available.
> 2. In order to view the alert query in Explore mode, you must have either a Grafana Admin or Grafana Editor role permissions. If you don't have the needed permissions, you will get a respective Grafana error.
