# What is Azure Native Dynatrace Service?

## Overview

Azure Native ISV Services enable you to easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate independent software vendor (ISV) software and services on Azure. This Azure Native ISV Service is developed and managed by Microsoft and Dynatrace.

You can find Azure Native Dynatrace Service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Dynatrace.Observability%2Fmonitors) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/dynatrace.dynatrace_portal_integration?tab=Overview).

Dynatrace is a monitoring solution that provides deep cloud observability, advanced AIOps, and continuous runtime application security capabilities in Azure.

The Azure Native Dynatrace Service offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage Dynatrace environments using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. This enables you to use Dynatrace as a monitoring solution for your Azure workloads through a streamlined workflow, starting from procurement, all the way to configuration and management.

You can create and manage the Dynatrace resources using the Azure portal through a resource provider named `Dynatrace.Observability`. Dynatrace owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the Dynatrace environments created through this experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Native Dynatrace Service stores and processes customer data only in the region where the service was deployed. No data is stored outside of that region.
