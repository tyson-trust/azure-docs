# What is Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service?

Azure Native ISV Services enable you to easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate independent software vendor (ISV) software and services on Azure. This Azure Native ISV Service is developed and managed by Microsoft and Qumulo.

You can find Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Qumulo.Storage%2FfileSystems) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/qumulo1584033880660.qumulo-saas-mpp?tab=Overview).

Qumulo is an industry leader in distributed file system and object storage. Qumulo provides a scalable, performant, and simple-to-use cloud-native file system that can support a wide variety of data workloads. The file system uses standard file-sharing protocols, such as NFS, SMB, FTP, and S3.

The Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service offering on Azure Marketplace enables you to create and manage a Qumulo file system by using the Azure portal with a seamlessly integrated experience. You can also create and manage Qumulo resources by using the Azure portal through the resource provider `Qumulo.Storage/fileSystem`. Qumulo manages the service while giving you full admin rights to configure details like file system shares, exports, quotas, snapshots, and Active Directory users.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Native Qumulo Scalable File Service stores and processes data only in the region where the service was deployed. No data is stored outside that region.
