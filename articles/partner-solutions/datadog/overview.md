# What is Datadog - An Azure Native ISV Service?

## Overview

Azure Native ISV Services enable you to easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate independent software vendor (ISV) software and services on Azure. This Azure Native ISV Service is developed and managed by Microsoft and Datadog.

You can find Datadog – An Azure Native ISV Service in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Datadog%2Fmonitors) or get it on the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/datadog1591740804488.dd_liftr_v2?tab=Overview).

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform for large-scale applications. It encompasses infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, and user-experience monitoring. Datadog aggregates data across your entire stack with 400+ integrations for troubleshooting, alerting, and graphing. You can use it as a single source for troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and cross-team collaboration.

Datadog's offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to manage Datadog in the Azure console as an integrated service. This availability means you can implement Datadog as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow. The workflow covers everything from procurement to configuration.
