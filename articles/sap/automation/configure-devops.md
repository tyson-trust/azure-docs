# Use SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework from Azure DevOps Services

Using Azure DevOps will streamline the deployment process by providing pipelines that can be executed to perform both the infrastructure deployment and the configuration and SAP installation activities.
You can use Azure Repos to store your configuration files and Azure Pipelines to deploy and configure the infrastructure and the SAP application.

## Sign up for Azure DevOps Services

To use Azure DevOps Services, you'll need an Azure DevOps organization. An organization is used to connect groups of related projects. Use your work or school account to automatically connect your organization to your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). To create an account, open [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) and either _sign-in_ or create a new account.

## Configure Azure DevOps Services for the SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework

You can use the following script to do a basic installation of Azure Devops Services for the SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework.

Open PowerShell ISE and copy the following script and update the parameters to match your environment.

```powershell
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_ORGANIZATION = "https://dev.azure.com/ORGANIZATIONNAME"
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_PROJECT = "SAP Deployment Automation Framework"
    $Env:SDAF_CONTROL_PLANE_CODE = "MGMT"
    $Env:SDAF_WORKLOAD_ZONE_CODE = "DEV"
    $Env:SDAF_ControlPlaneSubscriptionID = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    $Env:SDAF_WorkloadZoneSubscriptionID = "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy"
    $Env:ARM_TENANT_ID="zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz"
    
    $UniqueIdentifier = Read-Host "Please provide an identifier that makes the service principal names unique, for instance a project code"
    
    $confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to create a new Application registration (needed for the Web Application) y/n?"
    if ($confirmation -eq 'y') {
        $Env:SDAF_APP_NAME = $UniqueIdentifier + " SDAF Control Plane"
    }
    
    else {
      $Env:SDAF_APP_NAME = Read-Host "Please provide the Application registration name"
    }
    
    $confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to create a new Service Principal for the Control plane y/n?"
    if ($confirmation -eq 'y') {
        $Env:SDAF_MGMT_SPN_NAME = $UniqueIdentifier + " SDAF " + $Env:SDAF_CONTROL_PLANE_CODE + " SPN"
    }
        else {
      $Env:SDAF_MGMT_SPN_NAME = Read-Host "Please provide the Control Plane Service Principal Name"
    }
    
    $confirmation = Read-Host "Do you want to create a new Service Principal for the Workload zone y/n?"
    if ($confirmation -eq 'y') {
        $Env:SDAF_WorkloadZone_SPN_NAME = $UniqueIdentifier + " SDAF " + $Env:SDAF_WORKLOAD_ZONE_CODE + " SPN"
    }
        else {
      $Env:SDAF_WorkloadZone_SPN_NAME = Read-Host "Please provide the Workload Zone Service Principal Name"
    }
    
    if ( $PSVersionTable.Platform -eq "Unix") {
        if ( Test-Path "SDAF") {
        }
        else {
            $sdaf_path = New-Item -Path "SDAF" -Type Directory
        }
    }
    else {
        $sdaf_path = Join-Path -Path $Env:HOMEDRIVE -ChildPath "SDAF"
        if ( Test-Path $sdaf_path) {
        }
        else {
            New-Item -Path $sdaf_path -Type Directory
        }
    }
    
    Set-Location -Path $sdaf_path
    
    if ( Test-Path "New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1") {
        remove-item .\New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1
    }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/sap-automation/main/deploy/scripts/New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1 -OutFile .\New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1 ; .\New-SDAFDevopsProject.ps1
    
```

Run the script and follow the instructions. The script will open browser windows for authentication and for performing tasks in the Azure DevOps project.

You can choose to either run the code directly from GitHub or you can import a copy of the code into your Azure DevOps project.


Validate that the project has been created by navigating to the Azure DevOps portal and selecting the project. Ensure that the Repo is populated and that the pipelines have been created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run the following steps on your local workstation, also ensure that you have the latest Azure CLI installed by running the 'az upgrade' command.

### Configure Azure DevOps Services artifacts for a new Workload zone.

You can use the following script to deploy the artifacts needed to support a new workload zone. This will create the Variable group and the Service Connection in Azure DevOps as well as optionally the deployment service principal.

Open PowerShell ISE and copy the following script and update the parameters to match your environment.

```powershell
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_ORGANIZATION = "https://dev.azure.com/ORGANIZATIONNAME"
    $Env:SDAF_ADO_PROJECT = "SAP Deployment Automation Framework"
    $Env:SDAF_WorkloadZoneSubscriptionID = "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy"
    $Env:ARM_TENANT_ID="zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz"
    
    if ( $PSVersionTable.Platform -eq "Unix") {
        if ( Test-Path "SDAF") {
        }
        else {
            $sdaf_path = New-Item -Path "SDAF" -Type Directory
        }
    }
    else {
        $sdaf_path = Join-Path -Path $Env:HOMEDRIVE -ChildPath "SDAF"
        if ( Test-Path $sdaf_path) {
        }
        else {
            New-Item -Path $sdaf_path -Type Directory
        }
    }
    
    Set-Location -Path $sdaf_path
    
    if ( Test-Path "New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1") {
        remove-item .\New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1
    }
    
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/sap-automation/main/deploy/scripts/New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1 -OutFile .\New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1 ; .\New-SDAFDevopsWorkloadZone.ps1
    
```


### Create a sample Control Plane configuration

You can run the 'Create Sample Deployer Configuration' pipeline to create a sample configuration for the Control Plane. When running choose the appropriate Azure region. You can also control if you want to deploy Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion.

## Manual configuration of Azure DevOps Services for the SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework

### Create a new project

You can use Azure Repos to store both the code from the sap-automation GitHub repository and the environment configuration files.

Open (https://dev.azure.com) and create a new project by clicking on the _New Project_ button and enter the project details. The project will contain both the Azure Repos source control repository and Azure Pipelines for performing deployment activities.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to see _New Project_ ensure that you have permissions to create new projects in the organization.

Record the URL of the project.
### Import the repository

Start by importing the SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework GitHub repository into Azure Repos.

Navigate to the Repositories section and choose Import a repository, import the 'https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-bootstrap.git' repository into Azure DevOps. For more info, see [Import a repository](/azure/devops/repos/git/import-git-repository?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true)

If you're unable to import a repository, you can create the repository manually, and then import the content from the SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework GitHub repository to it.

### Create the repository for manual import

> [!NOTE]
> Only do this step if you are unable to import the repository directly.

Create the 'workspaces' repository by navigating to the 'Repositories' section in 'Project Settings' and clicking the _Create_ button.

Choose the repository type 'Git' and provide a name for the repository, for example 'SAP Configuration Repository'.
### Cloning the repository

In order to provide a more comprehensive editing capability of the content, you can clone the repository to a local folder and edit the contents locally.
Clone the repository to a local folder by clicking the  _Clone_ button in the Files view in the Repos section of the portal. For more info, see [Cloning a repository](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone?view=azure-devops#clone-an-azure-repos-git-repo&preserve-view=true)

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-repo-clone.png" alt-text="Picture showing how to clone the repository":::

### Manually importing the repository content using a local clone

You can also download the content from the SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework repository manually and add it to your local clone of the Azure DevOps repository.

Navigate to 'https://github.com/Azure/SAP-automation-samples' repository and download the repository content as a ZIP file by clicking the _Code_ button and choosing _Download ZIP_.

Copy the content from the zip file to the root folder of your local clone.

Open the local folder in Visual Studio code, you should see that there are changes that need to be synchronized by the indicator by the source control icon as is shown in the picture below.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-vscode-changes.png" alt-text="Picture showing that source code has changed":::

Select the source control icon and provide a message about the change, for example: "Import from GitHub" and press Cntr-Enter to commit the changes. Next select the _Sync Changes_ button to synchronize the changes back to the repository.

### Choosing the source for the Terraform and Ansible code

You can either run the SDAF code directly from GitHub or you can import it locally.
#### Running the code from a local repository 

If you want to run the SDAF code from the local Azure DevOps project you need to create a separate code repository and a configuration repository in the Azure DevOps project.

Name of code repository: 'sap-automation', source: 'https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation.git'

Name of sample and template repository: 'sap-samples', source: 'https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation-samples.git'

#### Running the code directly from GitHub
If you want to run the code directly from GitHub you need to provide credentials for Azure DevOps to be able to pull the content from GitHub.
#### Creating the GitHub Service connection

To pull the code from GitHub, you need a GitHub service connection. For more information, see [Manage service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true)

To create the service connection, go to Project settings and navigate to the Service connections setting in the Pipelines section.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-create-service-connection.png" alt-text="Picture showing how to create a Service connection for GitHub":::

Choose _GitHub_ as the service connection type. Choose 'Azure Pipelines' in the OAuth Configuration drop-down.

Click 'Authorize' to log on to GitHub.
 
Enter a Service connection name, for instance 'SDAF Connection to GitHub' and ensure that the _Grant access permission to all pipelines_ checkbox is checked. Select _Save_ to save the service connection.



## Set up the web app

The automation framework optionally provisions a web app as a part of the control plane to assist with the SAP workload zone and system configuration files. If you would like to use the web app, you must first create an app registration for authentication purposes. Open the Azure Cloud Shell and execute the following commands:

# [Linux](#tab/linux)
Replace MGMT with your environment as necessary.
```bash
echo '[{"resourceAppId":"00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000","resourceAccess":[{"id":"e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d","type":"Scope"}]}]' >> manifest.json

TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id=$(az ad app create --display-name MGMT-webapp-registration --enable-id-token-issuance true --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --required-resource-access @manifest.json --query "appId" | tr -d '"')

echo $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id

az ad app credential reset --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --append --query "password"

rm manifest.json
```
# [Windows](#tab/windows)
Replace MGMT with your environment as necessary.
```powershell
Add-Content -Path manifest.json -Value '[{"resourceAppId":"00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000","resourceAccess":[{"id":"e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d","type":"Scope"}]}]'

$TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id=(az ad app create --display-name MGMT-webapp-registration --enable-id-token-issuance true --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg --required-resource-access .\manifest.json --query "appId").Replace('"',"")

echo $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id

az ad app credential reset --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --append --query "password"

del manifest.json
```
---

Save the app registration ID and password values for later use.

## Variable definitions

The deployment pipelines are configured to use a set of predefined parameter values defined using variable groups.


### Common variables

There's a set of common variables that are used by all the deployment pipelines. These variables are stored in a variable group called 'SDAF-General'.

Create a new variable group 'SDAF-General' using the Library page in the Pipelines section. Add the following variables:

| Variable                           | Value                                   | Notes                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deployment_Configuration_Path      | WORKSPACES                              | For testing the sample configuration use 'samples/WORKSPACES' instead of WORKSPACES.        |
| Branch                             | main                                    |                                                                                             |
| S-Username                         | `<SAP Support user account name>`       |                                                                                             |
| S-Password                         | `<SAP Support user password>`           | Change variable type to secret by clicking the lock icon.                                   |
| `tf_version`                       | 1.3.0                                   | The Terraform version to use, see [Terraform download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)  |

Save the variables.

Or alternatively you can use the Azure DevOps CLI to set up the groups.

```bash
s-user="<SAP Support user account name>"
s-password="<SAP Support user password>"

az devops login

az pipelines variable-group create --name SDAF-General --variables ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=false Deployment_Configuration_Path=WORKSPACES Branch=main S-Username=$s-user S-Password=$s-password tf_varsion=1.3.0 --output yaml

```

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to assign permissions for all pipelines using _Pipeline permissions_.

### Environment specific variables

As each environment may have different deployment credentials you'll need to create a variable group per environment, for example 'SDAF-MGMT','SDAF-DEV', 'SDAF-QA'.

Create a new variable group 'SDAF-MGMT' for the control plane environment using the Library page in the Pipelines section. Add the following variables:

| Variable                        | Value                                                              | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent                           | 'Azure Pipelines' or the name of the agent pool                    | Note, this pool will be created in a later step.         |
| CP_ARM_CLIENT_ID                   | 'Service principal application ID'.                                |                                                          |

Save the variables.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember to assign permissions for all pipelines using _Pipeline permissions_.
>
> When using the web app, ensure that the Build Service has at least Contribute permissions.

> You can use the clone functionality to create the next environment variable group. APP_REGISTRATION_APP_ID, WEB_APP_CLIENT_SECRET, SDAF_GENERAL_GROUP_ID, WORKLOADZONE_PIPELINE_ID and SYSTEM_PIPELINE_ID are only needed for the SDAF-MGMT group.



## Create a service connection

To remove the Azure resources, you need an Azure Resource Manager service connection. For more information, see [Manage service connections](/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&preserve-view=true)

To create the service connection, go to Project settings and navigate to the Service connections setting in the Pipelines section.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-create-service-connection.png" alt-text="Picture showing how to create a Service connection":::

Choose _Azure Resource Manager_ as the service connection type and _Service principal (manual)_ as the authentication method. Enter the target subscription, typically the control plane subscription, and provide the service principal details. Validate the credentials using the _Verify_ button. For more information on how to create a service principal, see [Creating a Service Principal](deploy-control-plane.md#prepare-the-deployment-credentials).

Enter a Service connection name, for instance 'Connection to MGMT subscription' and ensure that the _Grant access permission to all pipelines_ checkbox is checked. Select _Verify and save_ to save the service connection.

## Permissions

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the pipelines will add files to the Azure Repos and therefore require pull permissions. Assign "Contribute" permissions to the 'Build Service' using the Security tab of the source code repository in the Repositories section in Project settings.

:::image type="content" source="./media/devops/automation-repo-permissions.png" alt-text="Picture showing repository permissions":::

## Deploy the Control Plane

Newly created pipelines might not be visible in the default view. Select on recent tab and go back to All tab to view the new pipelines.

Select the _Control plane deployment_ pipeline, provide the configuration names for the deployer and the SAP library and choose "Run" to deploy the control plane. Make sure to check "Deploy the configuration web application" if you would like to set up the configuration web app.


### Configure the Azure DevOps Services self-hosted agent manually

> [!NOTE]
>This is only needed if the Azure DevOps Services agent is not automatically configured. Please check that the agent pool is empty before proceeding.


Connect to the deployer by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to the resource group containing the deployer virtual machine.

1. Connect to the virtual machine using Azure Bastion.

1. The default username is *azureadm*

1. Choose *SSH Private Key from Azure Key Vault*

1. Select the subscription containing the control plane.

1. Select the deployer key vault.

1. From the list of secrets choose the secret ending with *-sshkey*.

1. Connect to the virtual machine.

Run the following script to configure the deployer.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment

cd ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment

git clone https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation.git

cd sap-automation/deploy/scripts

./configure_deployer.sh
```

Reboot the deployer and reconnect and run the following script to set up the Azure DevOps agent.

```bash
cd ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/

$DEPLOYMENT_REPO_PATH/deploy/scripts/setup_ado.sh
```

Accept the license and when prompted for server URL, enter the URL you captured when you created the Azure DevOps Project. For authentication, choose PAT and enter the token value from the previous step.

When prompted enter the application pool name, you created in the previous step. Accept the default agent name and the default work folder name.
The agent will now be configured and started.


## Deploy the Control Plane Web Application

Checking the "deploy the web app infrastructure" parameter when running the Control plane deployment pipeline will provision the infrastructure necessary for hosting the web app. The "Deploy web app" pipeline will publish the application's software to that infrastructure.

Wait for the deployment to finish. Once the deployment is complete, navigate to the Extensions tab and follow the instructions to finalize the configuration and update the 'reply-url' values for the app registration.

As a result of running the control plane pipeline, part of the web app URL needed will be stored in a variable named "WEBAPP_URL_BASE" in your environment-specific variable group. You can at any time update the URLs of the registered application web app using the following command.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
webapp_url_base=<WEBAPP_URL_BASE>
az ad app update --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --web-home-page-url https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net --web-redirect-uris https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/ https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
```
# [Windows](#tab/windows)

```powershell
$webapp_url_base="<WEBAPP_URL_BASE>"
az ad app update --id $TF_VAR_app_registration_app_id --web-home-page-url https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net --web-redirect-uris https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/ https://${webapp_url_base}.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback
```
---
You will also need to grant reader permissions to the app service system-assigned managed identity. Navigate to the app service resource. On the left hand side, click "Identity". In the "system assigned" tab, click on "Azure role assignments" > "Add role assignment". Select "subscription" as the scope, and "reader" as the role. Then click save. Without this step, the web app dropdown functionality won't work.

You should now be able to visit the web app, and use it to deploy SAP workload zones and SAP system infrastructure.
