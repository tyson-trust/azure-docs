# Use Azure to host and run SAP workload scenarios

When you use Microsoft Azure, you can reliably run your mission-critical SAP workloads and scenarios on a scalable, compliant, and enterprise-proven platform. You get the scalability, flexibility, and cost savings of Azure. With the expanded partnership between Microsoft and SAP, you can run SAP applications across development and test and production scenarios in Azure and be fully supported. From SAP NetWeaver to SAP S/4HANA, SAP BI on Linux to Windows, and SAP HANA to SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, etc., we've got you covered.

Besides hosting SAP NetWeaver and S/4HANA scenarios with the different DBMS on Azure, you can host other SAP workload scenarios, like SAP BI on Azure. Our partnership with SAP resulted in a variety of integration scenarios with the overall Microsoft ecosystem. Check out the **dedicated [Integration section](./integration-get-started.md)** to learn more.

We just announced our  new services of Azure Center for SAP solutions and Azure Monitor for SAP solutions 2.0 entering the public preview stage. These services give you the possibility to deploy SAP workload on Azure in a highly automated manner in an optimal architecture and configuration. And monitor your Azure infrastructure, OS, DBMS, and ABAP stack deployments on one single pane of glass.

For customers and partners who are focused on deploying and operating their assets in public cloud through Terraform and Ansible, use our SAP on Azure Deployment Automation Framework to jump start your SAP deployments into Azure using our public Terraform and Ansible modules on [github](https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation).

Hosting SAP workload scenarios in Azure also can create requirements of identity integration and single sign-on. This situation can occur when you use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to connect different SAP components and SAP software-as-a-service (SaaS) or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offers. A list of such integration and single sign-on scenarios with Azure AD and SAP entities is described and documented in the section "Azure AD SAP identity integration and single sign-on."

## Changes to the SAP workload section

Changes to documents in the SAP on Azure workload section are listed at the [end of this article](./get-started.md#change-log). The entries in the change log are kept for around 180 days.

## You want to know

If you have specific questions, we're going to point you to specific documents or flows in this section of the start page. You want to know:

- Is Azure accepting new customers for HANA Large Instances? HANA Large Instance service is in sunset mode and doesn't accept new customers anymore. Providing units for existing HANA Large Instance customers is still possible. For alternatives, check the offers of HANA certified Azure VMs in the [HANA Hardware Directory](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/#/solutions?filters=iaas;ve:24).
- Can Azure Active Directory accounts be used to run the SAP ABAP stack in Windows guest OS. No, due to shortcomings in feature set of AAD, it can't be used for running the ABAP stack within the Windows guest OS
- What Azure Services, Azure VM types and Azure storage services are available in the different Azure regions, check the site [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/)
- Are third-party HA frameworks, besides Windows and Pacemaker supported? Check bottom part of [SAP support note #1928533](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1928533)
- What Azure storage is best for my scenario? Read [Azure Storage types for SAP workload](./planning-guide-storage.md)
- Is the Red Hat kernel in Oracle Enterprise Linux supported by SAP? Read SAP [SAP support note #1565179](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/1565179)
- Why are the Azures [Da(s)v4](../../virtual-machines/dav4-dasv4-series.md)/[Ea(s)](../../virtual-machines/eav4-easv4-series.md) VM families not certified for SAP HANA? The Azure Das/Eas VM families are based on AMD processor-driven hardware. SAP HANA doesn't support AMD processors, not even in virtualized scenarios
- Why am I still getting the message: 'The cpu flags for the RDTSCP instruction or the cpu flags for constant_tsc or nonstop_tsc aren't set or current_clocksource and available_clocksource aren't correctly configured' with SAP HANA, although I'm running the most recent Linux kernels. For the answer, check [SAP support note #2791572](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2791572)
- Where can I find architectures for deploying SAP Fiori on Azure? Check out the blog [SAP on Azure: Application Gateway Web Application Firewall (WAF) v2 Setup for Internet facing SAP Fiori Apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/12/03/sap-on-azure-application-gateway-web-application-firewall-waf-v2-setup-for-internet-facing-sap-fiori-apps/)

## Documentation space

In the SAP workload documentation space, you can find the following areas:

- **Integration with Microsoft Services** and **References** contain different links to integration scenarios between SAP and other Microsoft services. The list may not be complete.
- **SAP on Azure Large Instances**: This documentation section is covering a bare-metal service that originally was named HANA Large Instances. Different topics around this technology are covered in this section
- **Plan and Deploy (Azure VMs)**: Deploying SAP workload into Azure Infrastructure as a Service, you should go through the documents in this section first to learn more about the principle Azure components used and guidelines
- **Storage (Azure VMs)**: This section includes documents that give recommendations how to use the different Azure storage types when deploying SAP workload on Azure
- **DBMS Guides (Azure VMs)**: The section DBMS Guides covers specifics around deploying different DBMS that are supported for SAP workload in Azure IaaS
- **High Availability (Azure VMs)**: In this section, many of the high availability configurations around SAP workload on Azure are covered. This section includes detailed documentation around deploying Windows clustering and Pacemaker cluster configuration for the different SAP components and different database systems
- **Automation Framework (Azure VMs)**: Automation Framework documentation is covering a [Terraform and Ansible based automation framework](https://github.com/Azure/sap-automation) that allows automation of Azure infrastructure and SAP software
- **Azure Monitor for SAP solutions**: Microsoft developed monitoring solutions specifically for SAP supported OS and DBMS, as well as S/4HANA and NetWeaver. This section documents the deployment and usage of the service
