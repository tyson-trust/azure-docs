# Backend MTLS with Application Gateway for Containers - Gateway API (preview)

This document helps set up an example application that uses the following resources from Gateway API. Steps are provided to:
- Create a [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gateway) resource with one HTTPS listener.
- Create an [HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/api-types/httproute/) resource that references a backend service.
- Create a [BackendTLSPolicy](api-specification-kubernetes.md#alb.networking.azure.io/v1.BackendTLSPolicy) resource that has a client and CA certificate for the backend service referenced in the HTTPRoute.

## Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Application Gateway for Containers is currently in PREVIEW.<br>
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

1. If following the BYO deployment strategy, ensure you have set up your Application Gateway for Containers resources and [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md)
2. If following the ALB managed deployment strategy, ensure you have provisioned your [ALB Controller](quickstart-deploy-application-gateway-for-containers-alb-controller.md) and provisioned the Application Gateway for Containers resources via the  [ApplicationLoadBalancer custom resource](quickstart-create-application-gateway-for-containers-managed-by-alb-controller.md).
3. Deploy sample HTTP application
  Apply the following deployment.yaml file on your cluster to create a sample web application and deploy sample secrets to demonstrate backend mutual authentication (mTLS).
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f https://trafficcontrollerdocs.blob.core.windows.net/examples/https-scenario/end-to-end-ssl-with-backend-mtls/deployment.yaml
  ```
  
  This command creates the following on your cluster:
  - a namespace called `test-infra`
  - 1 service called `mtls-app` in the `test-infra` namespace
  - 1 deployment called `mtls-app` in the `test-infra` namespace
  - 1 config map called `mtls-app-nginx-cm` in the `test-infra` namespace
  - 4 secrets called `backend.com`, `frontend.com`, `gateway-client-cert`, and `ca.bundle` in the `test-infra` namespace

## Deploy the required Gateway API resources

# [ALB managed deployment](#tab/alb-managed)

Create a gateway:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-01
  namespace: test-infra
  annotations:
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-namespace: alb-test-infra
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-name: alb-test
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
  listeners:
  - name: https-listener
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - kind : Secret
        group: ""
        name: frontend.com
EOF
```

[!INCLUDE [application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming](../../../includes/application-gateway-for-containers-frontend-naming.md)]

# [Bring your own (BYO) deployment](#tab/byo)
1. Set the following environment variables

```bash
RESOURCE_GROUP='<resource group name of the Application Gateway For Containers resource>'
RESOURCE_NAME='alb-test'

RESOURCE_ID=$(az network alb show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $RESOURCE_NAME --query id -o tsv)
FRONTEND_NAME='frontend'
az network alb frontend create -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -n $FRONTEND_NAME --alb-name $AGFC_NAME
```

2. Create a Gateway
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-01
  namespace: test-infra
  annotations:
    alb.networking.azure.io/alb-id: $RESOURCE_ID
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-alb-external
  listeners:
  - name: https-listener
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: Same
    tls:
      mode: Terminate
      certificateRefs:
      - kind : Secret
        group: ""
        name: frontend.com
  addresses:
  - type: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-frontend
    value: $FRONTEND_NAME
EOF
```

---

Once the gateway resource has been created, ensure the status is valid, the listener is _Programmed_, and an address is assigned to the gateway.
```bash
kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Example output of successful gateway creation.
```yaml
status:
  addresses:
  - type: IPAddress
    value: xxxx.yyyy.alb.azure.com
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Valid Gateway
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Accepted
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
    message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Programmed
    status: "True"
    type: Programmed
  listeners:
  - attachedRoutes: 0
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Listener is accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T21:04:55Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    name: https-listener
    supportedKinds:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: HTTPRoute
```

Once the gateway has been created, create an HTTPRoute
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: https-route
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: gateway-01
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: mtls-app
      port: 443
EOF
```

Once the HTTPRoute resource has been created, ensure the route has been _Accepted_ and the Application Gateway for Containers resource has been _Programmed_.
```bash
kubectl get httproute https-route -n test-infra -o yaml
```

Verify the status of the Application Gateway for Containers resource has been successfully updated.

```yaml
status:
  parents:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: ""
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: ResolvedRefs
      status: "True"
      type: ResolvedRefs
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Route is Accepted
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Accepted
      status: "True"
      type: Accepted
    - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-19T22:18:23Z"
      message: Application Gateway For Containers resource has been successfully updated.
      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: Programmed
      status: "True"
      type: Programmed
    controllerName: alb.networking.azure.io/alb-controller
    parentRef:
      group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: gateway-01
      namespace: test-infra
  ```

Create a BackendTLSPolicy

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: alb.networking.azure.io/v1
kind: BackendTLSPolicy
metadata:
  name: mtls-app-tls-policy
  namespace: test-infra
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: ""
    kind: Service
    name: mtls-app
    namespace: test-infra
  default:
    sni: backend.com
    ports:
    - port: 443
    clientCertificateRef:
      name: gateway-client-cert
      group: ""
      kind: Secret
    verify:
      caCertificateRef:
        name: ca.bundle
        group: ""
        kind: Secret
      subjectAltName: backend.com
EOF
```

Once the BackendTLSPolicy object has been create check the status on the object to ensure that the policy is valid.

```bash
kubectl get backendtlspolicy -n test-infra mtls-app-tls-policy -o yaml
```

Example output of valid BackendTLSPolicy object creation.

```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-06-29T16:54:42Z"
    message: Valid BackendTLSPolicy
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Accepted
    status: "True"
    type: Accepted
```

## Test access to the application

Now we're ready to send some traffic to our sample application, via the FQDN assigned to the frontend. Use the following command to get the FQDN.

```bash
fqdn=$(kubectl get gateway gateway-01 -n test-infra -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
```

Curling this FQDN should return responses from the backend as configured on the HTTPRoute.

```bash
curl --insecure https://$fqdn/
```

Congratulations, you have installed ALB Controller, deployed a backend application and routed traffic to the application via the ingress on Application Gateway for Containers.
