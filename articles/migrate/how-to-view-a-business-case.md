# View a business case (preview)

This article describes how to review the business case reports for on-premises servers and workloads in your datacenter with Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment tool.

[Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md) helps you to plan and execute migration and modernization projects to Azure. Azure Migrate provides a centralized hub to track discovery, assessment, and migration of on-premises infrastructure, applications, and data to Azure. The hub provides Azure tools for assessment and migration, as well as third-party Independent Software Vendor (ISV) offerings.

## Prerequisites

- [Build](how-to-build-a-business-case.md) a business case if you have not built one already.

## Review the business case

There are four major reports that you need to review:
- **Overview**: This report is an executive summary of the business case and covers:
    - Potential savings (TCO).
    - Estimated year on year cashflow savings based on the estimated migration completed that year.
    - Savings from unique Azure benefits like Azure Hybrid Benefit.
    - Discovery insights covering the scope of the business case.
- **On-premises vs Azure**: This report covers the breakdown of the total cost of ownership by cost categories and insights on savings.
- **Azure IaaS**: This report covers the Azure and on-premises footprint of the servers and workloads recommended for migrating to Azure IaaS.
- **Azure PaaS**: This report covers the Azure and on-premises footprint of the workloads recommended for migrating to Azure PaaS.

## View a business case

1. In **Servers, databases and web apps** > **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**, select the number below **Total migration business cases**.
1. In **Business Case**, select a business case to open it. As an example (estimations and costs, for example, only):

## Overview report

### Potential savings
This card covers your potential total cost of ownership savings based on the chosen migration strategy. It includes one year savings from compute, storage, network, labor, and facilities cost (based on assumptions) to help you envision how Azure benefits can turn into cost savings. You can see the insights of different cost categories in the **On-premises vs Azure** report.

### Estimated on-premises cost
It covers the cost of running all the servers scoped in the business case using some of the industry benchmarks. It doesn't cover Facilities (lease/colocation/power) cost by default, but you can edit it in the on-premises cost assumptions section. It includes one time cost for some of the capital expenditures like hardware acquisition etc., and annual cost for other components that you might pay as operating expenses like maintenance etc.

### Estimated Azure cost
It covers the cost of all servers and workloads that have been identified as ready for migration/modernization as per the recommendation. Refer to the respective *Azure IaaS* and *Azure PaaS* report for details. The Azure cost is calculated based on the right sized Azure configuration, ideal migration target and most suitable pricing offers for your workloads. You can override the migration strategy, target location or other settings in the 'Azure cost' assumptions to see how your savings could change by migrating to Azure.

### YoY estimated current vs future state cost
As you plan to migrate to Azure in phases, this line chart shows your cashflow per year based on the estimated migration completed that year. By default, it's assumed that you'll migrate 0% in the current year, 20% in Year 1, 50% in Year 2, and 100% in Year 3.
- Current state cost shows how your net cashflow will be on-premises, given your infrastructure is growing 5% per year.
- The future state cost shows how your net cashflow will be as you migrate some percentage to Azure per year as in the 'Azure cost' assumptions, while your infrastructure is growing 5% per year.

### Savings with Azure Hybrid Benefits
Currently, this card shows a static percentage of max savings you could get with Azure hybrid Benefits. 

### Discovery insights
It covers the total severs scoped in the business case computation, virtualization distribution, utilization insights and distribution of servers based on workloads running on them.

### Utilization insights
It covers which servers are ideal for cloud, servers that can be decommissioned on-premises, and servers that can't be classified based on resource utilization/performance data:
- Ideal for cloud: These servers are best fit for migrating to Azure and comprises of active and idle servers:
    - Active servers: These servers delivered business value by being on and had their CPU and memory utilization above 5% and network utilization above 2%.
    - Idle servers: These servers were on but didn't deliver business value by having their CPU and memory utilization below 5% and network utilization below 2%.
- Decommission: These servers were expected to deliver business value, but didn't and can be decommissioned on-premises and recommended to not migrate to Azure:
    - Zombie: The CPU, memory and network utilization were 0% with no performance data collection issues.
- These servers were on but don't have adequate metrics available:
    - Unknown: Many servers can land in this section if the discovery is still ongoing or has some unaddressed discovery issues.
    
## On-premises vs Azure report
It covers cost components for on-premises and Azure, savings, and insights to understand the savings better.

## Azure IaaS report

**Azure tab**

This section contains the cost estimate by recommended target (Annual cost and also includes Compute, Storage, Network, labor components) and savings from Hybrid benefits.
- Azure VM:
    - **Estimated cost by savings options**: This card includes compute cost for Azure VMs. It is recommended that all idle servers are migrated via Pay as you go Dev/Test and others (Active and unknown) are migrated using 3 year Reserved Instance or 3 year Azure Savings Plan to maximize savings.
    - **Recommended VM family**: This card covers the VM sizes recommended. The ones marked Unknown are the VMs that have some readiness issues and no SKUs could be found for them.
    - **Recommended storage type**: This card covers the storage cost distribution across different recommended storage types.
- SQL Server on Azure VM:
This section assumes instance to SQL Server on Azure VM migration recommendation, and the number of VMs here are the number of instances recommended to be migrated as SQL Server on Azure VM:
    - **Estimated cost by savings options**: This card includes compute cost for SQL Server on Azure VMs. It is recommended that all idle servers are migrated via Pay as you go Dev/Test and others (Active and unknown) are migrated using 3 year Reserved Instance or 3 year Azure Savings Plan to maximize savings.
    - **Recommended VM family**: This card covers the VM sizes recommended. The ones marked Unknown are the VMs that have some readiness issues and no SKUs could be found for them.
