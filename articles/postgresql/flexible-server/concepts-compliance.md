## Overview of Compliance Certifications on Microsoft Azure

Customers experience an increasing demand for highly secure and compliant solutions as they face data breaches along with requests from governments to access online customer information. Important regulatory requirements such as the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](/compliance/regulatory/gdpr) or [Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)](/compliance/regulatory/offering-sox)  make selecting cloud services that help customers achieve trust, transparency, security, and compliance essential. To help customers achieve compliance with national/regional and industry specific regulations and requirements Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server build upon Microsoft Azureâ€™s compliance offerings to provide the most rigorous compliance certifications to customers at service general availability.
To help customers meet their own compliance obligations across regulated industries and markets worldwide, Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry both in terms of breadth (total number of offerings), as well as depth (number of customer-facing services in assessment scope). Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments: globally applicable, US government, 
industry specific, and region/country specific. Compliance offerings are based on various types of assurances, including formal certifications, attestations, validations, authorizations, and assessments produced by independent third-party auditing firms, as well as contractual amendments, self-assessments and customer guidance documents produced by Microsoft. More detailed information about Azure compliance offerings is available from the [Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview) Center.
