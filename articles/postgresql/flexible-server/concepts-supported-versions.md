New servers will be created with this minor version. Your existing servers will be automatically upgraded to the latest supported minor version in your future scheduled maintenance window.

## PostgreSQL version 11

The current minor release is **11.20**. Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/11.20/) to learn more about improvements and fixes in this release. New servers will be created with this minor version. Your existing servers will be automatically upgraded to the latest supported minor version in your future scheduled maintenance window.

## PostgreSQL version 10 and older

We don't support PostgreSQL version 10 and older for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server. Please use the [Single Server](../concepts-supported-versions.md) deployment option if you require older versions.

## Managing upgrades

The PostgreSQL project regularly issues minor releases to fix reported bugs. Azure Database for PostgreSQL automatically patches servers with minor releases during the service's monthly deployments.

Automation for major version upgrade isn't yet supported. For example, there's currently no automatic upgrade from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 12.<!-- To upgrade to the next major version, create a [database dump and restore](howto-migrate-using-dump-and-restore.md) to a server that was created with the new engine version.-->

## Supportability and retirement policy of the underlying operating system

Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed open-source database. The underlying operating system is an integral part of the service. Microsoft continually works to ensure ongoing security updates and maintenance for security compliance and vulnerability mitigation, regardless of whether it is provided by a third-party or an internal vendor. Automatic upgrades during scheduled maintenance keep your managed database secure, stable, and up-to-date.


## Managing PostgreSQL engine defects

Microsoft has a team of committers and contributors who work full time on the open source Postgres project and are long term members of the community. Our contributions include but aren't  limited to features, performance enhancements, bug fixes, security patches among other things. Our open source team also incorporates feedback from our Azure fleet (and customers) when prioritizing work, however please keep in mind that Postgres project has its own independent contribution guidelines, review process and release schedule.

When a defect with PostgreSQL engine is identified, Microsoft will take immediate action to mitigate the issue. If it requires code change, Microsoft will fix the defect to address the production issue, if possible, and work with the community to incorporate the fix as quickly as possible.
