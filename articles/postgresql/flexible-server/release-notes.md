## Frequently Asked Questions

 Will Flexible Server, replace Single Server or Will Single Server be retired soon?

We continue to support Single Server and encourage you to adopt Flexible Server, which has richer capabilities such as zone resilient HA, predictable performance, maximum control, custom maintenance window, cost optimization controls and simplified developer experience suitable for your enterprise workloads. If we decide to retire any service, feature, API or SKU, you'll receive advance notice including a migration or transition path. Learn more about Microsoft Lifecycle policies [here](/lifecycle/faq/general-lifecycle).
