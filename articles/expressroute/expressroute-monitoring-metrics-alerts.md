# ExpressRoute monitoring, metrics, and alerts

This article helps you understand ExpressRoute monitoring, metrics, and alerts using Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor is one stop shop for all metrics, alerting, diagnostic logs across all of Azure.
 
>[!NOTE]
>Using **Classic Metrics** is not recommended.
>

## ExpressRoute metrics

To view **Metrics**, go to the *Azure Monitor* page and select *Metrics*. To view **ExpressRoute** metrics, filter by Resource Type *ExpressRoute circuits*. To view **Global Reach** metrics, filter by Resource Type *ExpressRoute circuits* and select an ExpressRoute circuit resource that has Global Reach enabled. To view **ExpressRoute Direct** metrics, filter Resource Type by *ExpressRoute Ports*. 

Once a metric is selected, the default aggregation will be applied. Optionally, you can apply splitting, which will show the metric with different dimensions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When viewing ExpressRoute metrics in the Azure portal, select a time granularity of **5 minutes or greater** for best possible results.

### Aggregation Types:

Metrics explorer supports SUM, MAX, MIN, AVG and COUNT as [aggregation types](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-charts.md#aggregation). You should use the recommended Aggregation type when reviewing the insights for each ExpressRoute metric.

* Sum: The sum of all values captured during the aggregation interval. 
* Count: The number of measurements captured during the aggregation interval. 
* Average: The average of the metric values captured during the aggregation interval. 
* Min: The smallest value captured during the aggregation interval. 
* Max: The largest value captured during the aggregation interval.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/fastpath-routes-count-port.png" alt-text="Screenshot of FastPath routes count at port level metric.":::

## ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway Metrics

Aggregation type: *Avg*

When you deploy an ExpressRoute gateway, Azure manages the compute and functions of your gateway. There are six gateway metrics available to you to better understand the performance of your gateway:

* Bits received per second
* CPU Utilization
* Packets per seconds
* Count of routes advertised to peers
* Count of routes learned from peers
* Frequency of routes changed
* Number of VMs in the virtual network
* Active flows
* Max flows created per second

It's highly recommended you set alerts for each of these metrics so that you're aware of when your gateway could be seeing performance issues.

### <a name = "gwbits"></a>Bits received per second - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Avg*

This metric captures inbound bandwidth utilization on the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway instances. Set an alert for how frequent the bandwidth utilization exceeds a certain threshold. If you need more bandwidth, increase the size of the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/inbound-gateway.png" alt-text="Screenshot of inbound bit per second - split metrics.":::

### <a name = "cpu"></a>CPU Utilization - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Avg*

You can view the CPU utilization of each gateway instance. The CPU utilization may spike briefly during routine host maintenance but prolong high CPU utilization could indicate your gateway is reaching a performance bottleneck. Increasing the size of the ExpressRoute gateway may resolve this issue. Set an alert for how frequent the CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/cpu-split.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of CPU utilization - split metrics.":::

### <a name = "packets"></a>Packets Per Second - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Avg*

This metric captures the number of inbound packets traversing the ExpressRoute gateway. You should expect to see a consistent stream of data here if your gateway is receiving traffic from your on-premises network. Set an alert for when the number of packets per second drops below a threshold indicating that your gateway is no longer receiving traffic.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/pps-split.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot of packets per second - split metrics.":::

### <a name = "advertisedroutes"></a>Count of Routes Advertised to Peer - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Max*

This metric shows the number of routes the ExpressRoute gateway is advertising to the circuit. The address spaces may include virtual networks that are connected using VNet peering and uses remote ExpressRoute gateway. You should expect the number of routes to remain consistent unless there are frequent changes to the virtual network address spaces. Set an alert for when the number of advertised routes drop below the threshold for the number of virtual network address spaces you're aware of.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/count-of-routes-advertised-to-peer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of count of routes advertised to peer.":::

### <a name = "learnedroutes"></a>Count of routes learned from peer - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Max*

This metric shows the number of routes the ExpressRoute gateway is learning from peers connected to the ExpressRoute circuit. These routes can be either from another virtual network connected to the same circuit or learned from on-premises. Set an alert for when the number of learned routes drop below a certain threshold. This could indicate either the gateway is seeing a performance problem or remote peers are no longer advertising routes to the ExpressRoute circuit. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/count-of-routes-learned-from-peer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of count of routes learned from peer.":::

### <a name = "frequency"></a>Frequency of routes change - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Sum*

This metric shows the frequency of routes being learned from or advertised to remote peers. You should first investigate your on-premises devices to understand why the network is changing so frequently. A high frequency in routes change could indicate a performance problem on the ExpressRoute gateway where scaling the gateway SKU up may resolve the problem. Set an alert for a frequency threshold to be aware of when your ExpressRoute gateway is seeing abnormal route changes.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/frequency-of-routes-changed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of frequency of routes changed metric.":::

### <a name = "vm"></a>Number of VMs in the virtual network

Aggregation type: *Max*

This metric shows the number of virtual machines that are using the ExpressRoute gateway. The number of virtual machines may include VMs from peered virtual networks that use the same ExpressRoute gateway. Set an alert for this metric if the number of VMs goes above a certain threshold that could affect the gateway performance. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/number-of-virtual-machines-virtual-network.png" alt-text="Screenshot of number of virtual machines in the virtual network metric.":::

>[!NOTE]
> To maintain reliability of the service, Microsoft often performs platform or OS maintenance on the gateway service. During this time, this metric may fluctuate and report inaccurately.
>

## <a name = "activeflows"></a>Active flows

Aggregation type: *Avg*

Split by: Gateway Instance


This metric displays a count of the total number of active flows on the ExpressRoute Gateway. Only inbound traffic from on-premises is captured for active flows. Through split at instance level, you can see active flow count per gateway instance. For more information, see [understand network flow limits](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput.md#network-flow-limits).

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/active-flows.png" alt-text="Screenshot of number of active flows per second metrics dashboard.":::

## <a name = "maxflows"></a>Max flows created per second

Aggregation type: *Max*

Split by: Gateway Instance and Direction (Inbound/Outbound)

This metric display maximum number of flows created per second on the ExpressRoute Gateway. Through split at instance level and direction, you can see max flow creation rate per gateway instance and inbound/outbound direction respectively. For more information, see [understand network flow limits](../virtual-network/virtual-machine-network-throughput.md#network-flow-limits).

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/max-flows-per-second.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the maximum number of flows created per second metrics dashboard.":::

## <a name = "connectionbandwidth"></a>ExpressRoute gateway connections in bits/seconds

Aggregation type: *Avg*

This metric shows the bits per second for ingress and egress to Azure through the ExpressRoute gateway. You can split this metric further to see specific connections to the ExpressRoute circuit.

## ExpressRoute Traffic Collector metrics

### CPU Utilization - Split by instance

Aggregation type: *Avg* (of percentage of total utilized CPU)  

*Granularity: 5 min*  

You can view the CPU utilization of each ExpressRoute Traffic Collector instance. The CPU utilization may spike briefly during routine host maintenance, but prolonged high CPU utilization could indicate your ExpressRoute Traffic Collector is reaching a performance bottleneck.  

**Guidance:** Set an alert for when avg CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold.

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/cpu-usage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of CPU usage for ExpressRoute Traffic Collector." lightbox="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/cpu-usage.png":::

### Memory Utilization - Split by instance 

Aggregation type: *Avg* (of percentage of total utilized Memory) 

*Granularity: 5 min*

You can view the memory utilization of each ExpressRoute Traffic Collector instance. Memory utilization may spike briefly during routine host maintenance, but prolonged high memory utilization could indicate your Azure Traffic Collector is reaching a performance bottleneck.  

**Guidance:** Set an alert for when avg memory utilization exceeds a certain threshold.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/memory-usage.png" alt-text="Screenshot of memory usage for ExpressRoute Traffic Collector." lightbox="./media/expressroute-monitoring-metrics-alerts/memory-usage.png":::

### Count of flow records processed - Split by instances or ExpressRoute circuit

Aggregation type: *Count*  

*Granularity: 5 min*  

You can view the count of number of flow records processed by ExpressRoute Traffic Collector, aggregated across ExpressRoute Circuits. Customer can split the metrics across each ExpressRoute Traffic Collector instance or ExpressRoute circuit when multiple circuits are associated to the ExpressRoute Traffic Collector. Monitoring this metric will help you understand if you need to deploy more ExpressRoute Traffic Collector instances or migrate ExpressRoute circuit association from one ExpressRoute Traffic Collector deployment to another.  

**Guidance:** Splitting by circuits is recommended when multiple ExpressRoute circuits are associated with an ExpressRoute Traffic Collector deployment. This will help determine the flow count of each ExpressRoute circuit and ExpressRoute Traffic Collector utilization by each ExpressRoute circuit.
