# Application performance monitoring and troubleshooting solutions for Azure VMware Solution

A key objective of Azure VMware Solution is to maintain the performance and security of applications and services across VMware on Azure and on-premises. Getting there requires visibility into complex infrastructures and quickly pinpointing the root cause of service disruptions across the hybrid cloud.
