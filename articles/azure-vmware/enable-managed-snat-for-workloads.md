# Enable Managed SNAT for Azure VMware Solution workloads 

In this article, you'll learn how to enable Azure VMware Solutionâ€™s Managed Source NAT (SNAT) to connect to the Internet outbound. A SNAT service translates from RFC1918 space to the public Internet for simple outbound Internet access. Note that ICMP (ping) is disabled by design; you cannot ping an Internet host. The SNAT service won't work when you have a default route from Azure.  

With this capability, you: 

- Have a basic SNAT service with outbound Internet connectivity from your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
- Have no control of outbound SNAT rules. 
- Are unable to view connection logs. 
- Have a limit of 128 000 concurrent connections.  

## Reference architecture
The architecture shows Internet access outbound from your Azure VMware Solution private cloud using an Azure VMware Solution Managed SNAT Service.

## Configure Outbound Internet access using Managed SNAT in the Azure port
1. Log in to the Azure portal and then search for and select **Azure VMware Solution**. 
2.	Select the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.    
1. In the left navigation, under **Workload Networking**, select **Internet Connectivity**.   
4.	Select **Connect using SNAT** button and select **Save**. 
    You have successfully enabled outbound Internet access for your Azure VMware Solution private cloud using our Managed SNAT service.
