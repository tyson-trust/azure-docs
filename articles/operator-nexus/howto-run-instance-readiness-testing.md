# Instance Readiness Testing

Instance Readiness Testing (IRT) is a framework built to orchestrate real-world workloads for testing of the Azure Operator Nexus Platform.

## Environment requirements

- A Linux environment (Ubuntu suggested) capable of calling Azure APIs
- Knowledge of networks to use for the test
    * Networks to use for the test are specified in a "networks-blueprint.yml" file, see [Input Configuration](#input-configuration).
- curl to download IRT package
- The User Access Admin & Contributor roles for the execution subscription
- The ability to create security groups in your Active Directory tenant

## Input configuration

Build your input file. The IRT tarball provides `irt-input.example.yml` as an example, follow the [instructions](#download-irt) to download the tarball. These values **will not work for your instances**, they need to be manually changed and the file should also be renamed to `irt-input.yml`. The example input file is provided as a stub to aid in configuring new input files. Overridable values and their usage are outlined in the example. The **[One Time Setup](#one-time-setup) assists in setting input values by writing key/value pairs to the config file as they execute.**

The network information is provided in either a `networks-blueprint.yml` file, similar to the `networks-blueprint.example.yml` that is provided, or appended to the `irt-input.yml` file. The  schema for IRT is defined in the `networks-blueprint.example.yml`. The networks are created as part of the test, provide network details that aren't in use. Currently IRT has the following network requirements:

* Three (3) L3 Networks
   * Two of them with MTU 1500
   * One of them with MTU 9000 and shouldn't have a fabric_asn attribute
* One (1) Trunked Network
* All VLANs should be greater than 500

## One Time Setup

### Download IRT
IRT is distributed via tarball, download it, extract it, and navigate to the `irt` directory.
1. From your Linux environment, download nexus-irt.tar.gz from aka.ms/nexus-irt `curl -Lo nexus-irt.tar.gz aka.ms/nexus-irt`
1. Extract the tarball to the local file system: `mkdir -p irt && tar xf nexus-irt.tar.gz --directory ./irt`
1. Switch to the new directory `cd irt`


### Install dependencies
There are multiple dependencies expected to be available during execution. Review this list;

* `jq` version 1.6 or greater
* `yq` version 4.33 or greater
* `azcopy` version 10 or greater
* `az` Azure CLI, stay up to date. Minimum expected version: 2.11.0(supports self upgrade)
* `elinks` - for viewing html files on the command line
* `tree` - for viewing directory structures
* `moreutils` - for viewing progress from the Azure Container Instance (ACI) container

The `setup.sh` script is provided to aid with installing the listed dependencies. It installs any dependencies that aren't available in PATH. It doesn't upgrade any dependencies that don't meet the minimum required versions.

> [!NOTE]
> `setup.sh` assumes a nonroot user and attempts to use `sudo`

### All in one setup

`all-in-one-setup.sh` is provided to create all of the Azure resources required to run IRT. This process includes creating a managed identity, a service principal, a security group, isolation domains, and a storage account to archive the test results. These resources can be created during the all in one script, or they can be created step by step per the instructions in this document. Each of the script, individually and via the all in one script, writes updates to your `irt-input.yml` file with the key value pairs needed to utilize the resources you created. Review the `irt-input.example.yml` file for the required inputs needed for one or more of the scripts, regardless of the methodology you pursue. All of the scripts are idempotent, and also allow you to use existing resources if desired.
### Step-by-Step setup

> [!NOTE]
> Only use this section if you're NOT using `all-in-one.sh`

If your workflow is incompatible with `all-in-one.sh`, each resource needed for IRT can be created manually with each supplemental script. Like `all-in-one.sh`, running these scripts  writes key/value pairs to your `irt-input.yml` for you to use during your run. These four scripts make up the `all-in-one.sh`.

IRT makes commands against your resources, and needs permission to do so. IRT requires a managed identity and a service principal to execute. It also requires that the service principal is a  member of the Azure AD Security Group that is also provided as input.

#### Create managed identity
<details>
<summary>Expand to see how to create managed identity.</summary>

A managed identity with the following role assignments is needed to execute tests. The supplemental script, `create-managed-identity.sh` creates a managed identity with these role assignments.
* `Contributor` - For creating and manipulating resources
* `Storage Blob Data Contributor` - For reading from and writing to the storage blob container
* `Log Analytics Reader` - For reading metadata about the LAW
* `Kubernetes Connected Cluster Role` - For read/write operations on connected cluster

Executing `create-managed-identity.sh` requires the input yaml to have the following properties, all of them can be overridden by the corresponding environment variables:
```yml
MANAGED_IDENTITY:
  RESOURCE_GROUP: "<resource-group>" # env: MANAGED_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP
  NAME: "<name>" # env: MANAGED_IDENTITY_NAME
  SUBSCRIPTION: "<subscription>" # env: MANAGED_IDENTITY_SUBSCRIPTION
  LOCATION: "<location>" # env: MANAGED_IDENTITY_LOCATION
```
* `MANAGED_IDENTITY.RESOURCE_GROUP` - The resource group the managed identity is created in.
* `MANAGED_IDENTITY.NAME` - The name of the managed identity to be created.
* `MANAGED_IDENTITY.SUBSCRIPTION` - The subscription where the resource group should reside.
* `MANAGED_IDENTITY.LOCATION` - The location to create the resource group.

```bash
# Example execution of the script
./create-managed-identity.sh irt-input.yml
```

> [!NOTE]
> if `MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID` is set in the input yaml or as an environment variable the script won't create anything.

**RESULT:** This script prints a value for `MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID` and sets it to the input.yml.
See [Input Configuration](#input-configuration).

```yml
MANAGED_IDENTITY_ID: <generated_id>
```
</details>

#### Create service principal and security group
<details>
<summary>Expand to see how to create service principal and security group.</summary>

A service principal with the following role assignments. The supplemental script, `create-service-principal.sh`  creates a service principal with these role assignments, or add role assignments to an existing service principal.

* `Contributor` - For creating and manipulating resources
* `Storage Blob Data Contributor` - For reading from and writing to the storage blob container
* `Azure ARC Kubernetes Admin` - For ARC enrolling the NAKS cluster

Additionally, the script creates the necessary security group, and adds the service principal to the security group. If the security group exists, it adds the service principal to the existing security group.

Executing `create-service-principal.sh` requires the input yaml to have the following properties, all of them can be overridden by the corresponding environment variables:
```yml
SERVICE_PRINCIPAL:
  NAME: "<name>" # env: SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME
  AAD_GROUP_NAME: "<aad-group-name>" # env: SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_AAD_GROUP_NAME
  SUBSCRIPTION: "<subscription>" # env: SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SUBSCRIPTION
```
* `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL.NAME` - The name of the service principal, created with the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command.
* `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL.AAD_GROUP_NAME` - The name of the security group.
* `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL.SUBSCRIPTION` - The subscription of the service principal.

```bash
# Example execution of the script
./create-service-principal.sh irt-input.yml
```

> [!NOTE]
> if all `SP_ID`,`SP_PASSWORD`,`SP_TENANT_ID`,`AAD_GROUP_ID` are set in the yaml or as an environment variable the script skips creating them.

**RESULT:** This script prints values for `AAD_GROUP_ID`, `SP_ID`, `SP_PASSWORD`, and `SP_TENANT` and sets the values back to the input yaml.
See [Input Configuration](#input-configuration).

```yml
SP_ID: "<generated-sp-id>"
SP_PASSWORD: "<generated-sp-password>" # If SP already exists sp password is not retreivable, please fill it in.
SP_TENANT_ID: "<generated-sp-tenant-id>"
AAD_GROUP_ID: "generated-aad-group-id"
```
</details>

#### Create l3 isolation domains
<details>
<summary>Expand to see how to create l3 isolation.</summary>

The testing framework doesn't create, destroy, or manipulate isolation domains. Therefore, existing isolation domains can be used. Each isolation domain requires at least one external network. The supplemental script, `create-l3-isolation-domains.sh`. Internal networks are created, manipulated, and destroyed through the course of testing.

Executing `create-l3-isolation-domains.sh` requires one **parameter**, a path to a file containing the networks requirements. You can choose either the standalone network-blueprint.yml or the input.yml based on your workflow, both should contain the information needed.

```bash
# Example of the script being invoked using networks-blueprint.yml:
./create-l3-isolation-domains.sh networks-blueprint.yml
```

```bash
# Example of the script being invoked using irt-input.yml:
# the network-blueprint should exist under NETWORK_BLUEPRINT node.
./create-l3-isolation-domains.sh irt-input.yml
```
</details>

#### Create archive storage
<details>
<summary>Expand to see how to create archive storage.</summary>

IRT creates an html test report after running a test scenario. These reports can optionally be uploaded to a blob storage container. The supplementary script `create-archive-storage.sh` to create a storage container, storage account, and resource group if they don't already exist.

Executing `create-archive-storage.sh` requires the input yaml to have the following properties, all of them can be overridden by the corresponding environment variables:

```yml
ARCHIVE_STORAGE:
  RESOURCE_GROUP: "<resource-group>" # env: ARCHIVE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_GROUP
  ACCOUNT_NAME: "<storage-account-name>" # env: ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME
  CONTAINER_NAME: "<storage-container-name>" # env: ARCHIVE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME
  SUBSCRIPTION: "<subscription>" # env: ARCHIVE_STORAGE_SUBSCRIPTION
  LOCATION: "<location>" # env: ARCHIVE_STORAGE_LOCATION
```
* `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_GROUP` - The resource group the managed identity is created in.
* `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` - The name of the Azure storage account to be created.
* `ARCHIVE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME` - The name of the blob storage container to be created.
* `SUBSCRIPTION` - The subscription where the resource group is created in.
* `LOCATION` - The location where the resource group is created in.

> [!NOTE]
> if `PUBLISH_RESULTS_TO` is set in the input yaml or as an environment variable the script skips creating a new one.

```bash
# Example execution of the script
./create-archive-storage.sh irt-input.yaml
```

**RESULT:** This script prints a value for `PUBLISH_RESULTS_TO` and sets the value in the input.yml. See [Input Configuration](#input-configuration).
```yml
PUBLISH_RESULTS_TO: <generated_id>
```
</details>

## Execution

* Execute. This example assumes irt-input.yml is in the same location as irt.sh. If your file is located in a different directory, provide the full file path.

```bash
./irt.sh irt-input.yml
```

## Results

1. A file named `summary-<cluster_name>-<timestamp>.html` is downloaded at the end of the run and contains the testing results. It can be viewed:
    1. From any browser
    1. Using elinks or lynx to view from the command line; for example:
       1.  `elinks summary-<cluster_name>-<timestamp>.html`
 1. If the `PUBLISH_RESULTS_TO` parameter was provided, the results are uploaded to the blob container you specified. It can be previewed by navigating to the link presented to you at the end of the IRT run.
