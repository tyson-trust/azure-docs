# Near-edge Azure Operator Nexus storage appliance

The architecture of Azure Operator Nexus revolves around core components such as compute servers, storage appliances, and network fabric devices. A single storage appliance is attached to each near-edge Azure Operator Nexus instance. These appliances play a vital role as the dedicated and persistent storage solution for the tenant workloads hosted in the Azure Operator Nexus instance.

Within each Azure Operator Nexus storage appliance, multiple storage devices are grouped together to form a unified storage pool. This pool is then divided into multiple volumes, which are then presented to the compute servers and tenant workloads as persistent volumes.
