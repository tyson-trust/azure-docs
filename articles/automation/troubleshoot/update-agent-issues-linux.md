# Troubleshoot Linux update agent issues

There can be many reasons why your machine isn't showing up as ready (healthy) in Update Management. You can check the health of a Linux Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to determine the underlying problem. The following are the three readiness states for a machine:

* Ready: The Hybrid Runbook Worker is deployed and was last seen less than one hour ago.
* Disconnected: The Hybrid Runbook Worker is deployed and was last seen over one hour ago.
* Not configured: The Hybrid Runbook Worker isn't found or hasn't finished deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> There can be a slight delay between what the Azure portal shows and the current state of a machine.

This article discusses how to run the troubleshooter for Azure machines from the Azure portal and non-Azure machines in the [offline scenario](#troubleshoot-offline).

> [!NOTE]
> The troubleshooter script currently doesn't route traffic through a proxy server if one is configured.

## Start the troubleshooter

For Azure machines, select the **troubleshoot** link under the **Update Agent Readiness** column in the portal to open the Troubleshoot Update Agent page. For non-Azure machines, the link brings you to this article. To troubleshoot a non-Azure machine, see the instructions in the **Troubleshoot offline** section.

> [!NOTE]
> The checks require the VM to be running. If the VM isn't running, **Start the VM** appears.

On the Troubleshoot Update Agent page, select **Run Checks** to start the troubleshooter. The troubleshooter uses [Run command](../../virtual-machines/linux/run-command.md) to run a script on the machine to verify the dependencies. When the troubleshooter is finished, it returns the result of the checks.

## Prerequisite checks

### Operating system

The operating system check verifies if the Hybrid Runbook Worker is running one of the [supported operating systems](../update-management/operating-system-requirements.md#supported-operating-systems).

### Dmidecode check

To verify if a VM is an Azure VM, check for Asset tag value using the below command:

```bash
sudo dmidecode
```

If the asset tag is different than 7783-7084-3265-9085-8269-3286-77, then reboot VM to initiate re-registration. 


## Monitoring agent service health checks

### Monitoring Agent

To fix this, install Azure Log Analytics Linux agent and ensure it communicates the required endpoints. For more information, see [Install Log Analytics agent on Linux computers](../../azure-monitor/agents/agent-linux.md).

This task checks if the folder is present - 

*/etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/conf/omsadmin.conf*

### Monitoring Agent status
 
To fix this issue, you must start the OMS Agent service by using the following command: 

```bash
 sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart
```

To validate you can perform process check using the below command: 

```bash
process_name="omsagent" 
ps aux | grep %s | grep -v grep" % (process_name)" 
```

For more information, see [Troubleshoot issues with the Log Analytics agent for Linux](../../azure-monitor/agents/agent-linux-troubleshoot.md)


### Multihoming
This check determines if the agent is reporting to multiple workspaces. Update Management doesn't support multihoming.

To fix this issue, purge the OMS Agent completely and reinstall it with the [workspace linked with Update management](../../azure-monitor/agents/agent-linux-troubleshoot.md#purge-and-reinstall-the-linux-agent)


Validate that there are no more multihoming by checking the directories under this path:

 */var/opt/microsoft/omsagent*. 

As they are the directories of workspaces, the number of directories equals the number of workspaces on-boarded to OMSAgent.

### Hybrid Runbook Worker
To fix the issue, run the following command: 

```bash
sudo su omsagent -c 'python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/Scripts/PerformRequiredConfigurationChecks.py'
```

This command forces the omsconfig agent to talk to Azure Monitor and retrieve the latest configuration. 

Validate to check if the following two paths exists:

```bash
/opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/VERSION </br> /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/configuration.py
```

### Hybrid Runbook Worker status

This check makes sure the Hybrid Runbook Worker is running on the machine. The processes in the example below should be present if the Hybrid Runbook Worker is running correctly.
```bash
ps -ef | grep python
```

```output
nxautom+   8567      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:00 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/main.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/oms.conf rworkspace:<workspaceId> <Linux hybrid worker version>
nxautom+   8593      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:02 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/hybridworker.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/state/automationworker/worker.conf managed rworkspace:<workspaceId> rversion:<Linux hybrid worker version>
nxautom+   8595      1  0 14:45 ?        00:00:02 python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/modules/nxOMSAutomationWorker/DSCResources/MSFT_nxOMSAutomationWorkerResource/automationworker/worker/hybridworker.py /var/opt/microsoft/omsagent/<workspaceId>/state/automationworker/diy/worker.conf managed rworkspace:<workspaceId> rversion:<Linux hybrid worker version>
```

Update Management downloads Hybrid Runbook Worker packages from the operations endpoint. Therefore, if the Hybrid Runbook Worker is not running and the [operations endpoint](#operations-endpoint) check fails, the update can fail.

To fix this issue, run the following command:

```bash
sudo su omsagent -c 'python /opt/microsoft/omsconfig/Scripts/PerformRequiredConfigurationChecks.py'
```

This command forces the omsconfig agent to talk to Azure Monitor and retrieve the latest configuration. 

If the issue still persists, run the [omsagent Log Collector tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/blob/master/tools/LogCollector/OMS_Linux_Agent_Log_Collector.md)



## Connectivity checks

### Proxy enabled check

To fix the issue, either remove the proxy or make sure that the proxy address is able to access the [prerequisite URL](../automation-network-configuration.md#update-management-and-change-tracking-and-inventory).

You can validate the task by running the below command:

```bash
HTTP_PROXY
```

### IMDS connectivity check

To fix this issue, allow access to IP **169.254.169.254**. For more information, see [Access Azure Instance Metadata Service](../../virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service.md#azure-instance-metadata-service-windows)

After the network changes, you can either rerun the Troubleshooter or run the below commands to validate: 

```bash
 curl -H \"Metadata: true\" http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2018-02-01
```

### General internet connectivity

This check makes sure that the machine has access to the internet and can be ignored if you have blocked internet and allowed only specific URLs. 

CURL on any http url.

### Registration endpoint

This check determines if the Hybrid Runbook Worker can properly communicate with Azure Automation in the Log Analytics workspace.

Proxy and firewall configurations must allow the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to communicate with the registration endpoint. For a list of addresses and ports to open, see [Network planning](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning)

Fix this issue by allowing the prerequisite URLs. For more information, see [Update Management and Change Tracking and Inventory](../automation-network-configuration.md#update-management-and-change-tracking-and-inventory)

Post the network changes you can either re-run the troubleshooter or CURL on provided jrds endpoint.

### Operations endpoint

This check determines if the Log Analytics agent can properly communicate with the Job Runtime Data Service.

Proxy and firewall configurations must allow the Hybrid Runbook Worker agent to communicate with the Job Runtime Data Service. For a list of addresses and ports to open, see [Network planning](../automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md#network-planning).

### Log Analytics endpoint 1

This check verifies that your machine has access to the endpoints needed by the Log Analytics agent.

Fix this issue by allowing the [prerequisite URLs](../automation-network-configuration.md#update-management-and-change-tracking-and-inventory).

Post making Network changes you can either rerun the Troubleshooter or
Curl on provided ODS endpoint.

### Log Analytics endpoint 2

This check verifies that your machine has access to the endpoints needed by the Log Analytics agent.

Fix this issue by allowing the [prerequisite URLs](../automation-network-configuration.md#update-management-and-change-tracking-and-inventory).

Post making Network changes you can either rerun the Troubleshooter or
Curl on provided OMS endpoint


### Software repositories

Fix this issue by allowing the prerequisite Repo URL. For RHEL, see [here](../../virtual-machines/workloads/redhat/redhat-rhui.md#troubleshoot-connection-problems-to-azure-rhui).

Post making Network changes you can either rerun the Troubleshooter or

Curl on software repositories configured in package manager. 

Refreshing repos would help to confirm the communication. 

```bash
sudo apt-get check
sudo yum check-update
```
> [!NOTE]
> The check is available only in offline mode.

## <a name="troubleshoot-offline"></a>Troubleshoot offline

You can use the troubleshooter offline on a Hybrid Runbook Worker by running the script locally. The Python script, [UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py](https://github.com/Azure/updatemanagement/blob/main/UM_Linux_Troubleshooter_Offline.py), can be found in GitHub.

 > [!NOTE]
 > The current version of the troubleshooter script does not support Ubuntu 20.04.
