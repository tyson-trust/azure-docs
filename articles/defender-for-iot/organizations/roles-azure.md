# Azure user roles and permissions for Defender for IoT

Microsoft Defender for IoT uses [Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/index.yml) to provide access to Enterprise IoT monitoring services and data on the Azure portal.

The built-in Azure [Security Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-reader), [Security Admin](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#security-admin), [Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor), and [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) roles are relevant for use in Defender for IoT.

This article provides a reference of Defender for IoT actions available for each role in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

## Roles and permissions reference

Permissions are applied to user roles across an entire Azure subscription, or in some cases, across individual Defender for IoT sites. For more information, see [Zero Trust and your OT networks](concept-zero-trust.md) and [Manage site-based access control (Public preview)](manage-users-portal.md#manage-site-based-access-control-public-preview).

## Enterprise IoT security

Add, edit, or cancel an Enterprise IoT plan with [Defender for Endpoint](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-endpoint) from Microsoft 365 Defender. Alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for Enterprise IoT networks are also only available from Microsoft 365 Defender.

In addition to the permissions listed above, Enterprise IoT security with Defender for IoT has the following requirements:

- **To add an Enterprise IoT plan**, you'll need an E5 license and specific permissions in your Microsoft 365 Defender tenant.
- **To view Enterprise IoT devices in your Azure device inventory**, you'll need an Enterprise IoT network sensor registered.

For more information, see [Securing IoT devices in the enterprise](concept-enterprise.md).
