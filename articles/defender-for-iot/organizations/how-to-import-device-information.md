# Import extra data for detected OT devices

OT networks sensors automatically monitor and analyze detected device traffic. In some cases, your organization's network policies may prevent some device data from being ingested to Microsoft Defender for IoT.

This article describes how you can manually import the missing data to your OT sensor and add it to the device data already detected.

## Prerequisites

Before performing the procedures in this article, you must have:

- An OT network sensor [installed](ot-deploy/install-software-ot-sensor.md), [configured, and activated](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md).

- Access to your OT network sensor as an **Admin** user. For more information, see [On-premises users and roles for OT monitoring with Defender for IoT](roles-on-premises.md).

- An understanding of the extra device data you want to import. Use that understanding to choose one of the following import methods:

    - **Import data from the device map** to import device names, types, groups, or Purdue layer
    - **Import data from system settings** to import device IP addresses, operating systems, patch levels, or authorization statuses

> [!TIP]
> A device's authorization status affects the alerts that are triggered by the OT sensor for the selected device. You'll receive alerts for any devices *not* listed as authorized devices, as they'll be considered to be unauthorized.

## Import data from the OT sensor device map

**To import device names, types, groups, or Purdue layers**:

1. Sign into your OT sensor and select **Device map** > **Export Devices** to export the device data already detected by your OT sensor.

1. Open the downloaded .CSV file for editing and modify *only* the following data, as needed:

    - **Name**. Maximum length: 30 characters
    - **Type**. Access the Defender for IoT [device settings file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/2/3/823c55c4-7659-4236-bfda-cc2427be2cee/CSS/devices_info_2.2.8%20and%20up.xlsx) and use one of the options listed in the **Devices type** tab
    - **Group**. Maximum length: 30 characters
    - **Purdue layer**. Enter one of the following: **Enterprise**, **Supervisory**, or **Process Control**

    Make sure to use capitalization standards already in use in the downloaded file. For example, in the **Purdue Layer** column, use *Title Caps*.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Make sure that you don't import data to your OT sensor that you've exported from a different sensor.

1. When you're done, save your file to a location accessible from your OT sensor.

1. On your OT sensor, in the **Device map** page, select **Import Devices** and select your modified .CSV file.

Your device data is updated.

## Import data from the OT sensor system settings

**To import device IP addresses, operating systems, or patch levels**:

1. Download the Defender for IoT [device settings file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/2/3/823c55c4-7659-4236-bfda-cc2427be2cee/CSS/devices_info_2.2.8%20and%20up.xlsx) and open it for editing.

1. In the downloaded file, enter the following details for each device:

    - **IP Address**. Enter the device's IP address.
    - **Device Type**. Enter one of the device types listed on the **Devices type** sheet.
    - **Last Update**. Enter the date that the device was last updated, in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

1. Sign into your OT sensor and select **System settings > Import settings > Device information**.

1. In the **Device information** pane, select **+ Import file** and then select your edited .CSV file.

1. Select **Close** to save your changes.

**To import device authorization status**:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After importing device authorization status, any devices *not* included in the import list are newly defined as not-authorized, and you'll start to receive new alerts about any traffic on each of these devices.

1. Download the Defender for IoT [device authorization file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/2/3/823c55c4-7659-4236-bfda-cc2427be2cee/CSS/authorized_devices%20-%20example.csv) and open it for editing.

1. In the downloaded file, list IP addresses and names for any devices you want to list as authorized devices. 

    Make sure that your names are accurate. Names imported from a .CSV file overwrite any names already shown in the OT sensor's device map.

1. Sign into your OT sensor and select **System settings > Import settings > Authorized devices**.

1. In the **Authorized devices** pane, select **+ Import File** and then select your edited .CSV file.

1. Select **Close** to save your changes.
