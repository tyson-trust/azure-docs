## July 2023

|Service area  |Updates  |
|---------|---------|
| **OT networks** | **Version 23.1.2**: <br>- [OT sensor installation and setup enhancements](#ot-sensor-installation-and-setup-enhancements) <br>- [Analyze and fine tune your deployment](#analyze-and-fine-tune-your-deployment) <br>- [Configure monitored interfaces via the sensor GUI](#configure-monitored-interfaces-via-the-sensor-gui)<br>- [Simplified privileged users](#simplified-privileged-users) <br><br>[Migrate to site-based licenses](#migrate-to-site-based-licenses) |

### OT sensor installation and setup enhancements

In version 23.1.2, we've updated the OT sensor installation and setup wizards to be quicker and more user-friendly. Updates include:

- **Installation wizard**: If you're installing software on your own physical or virtual machines, the Linux installation wizard now goes directly through the installation process without requiring any input or details from you.

    You can watch the installation run from a deployment workstation, but you might also choose to install the software without using a keyboard or screen, and let the installation run automatically. When it's done, access the sensor from the browser using the default IP address.

    - The installation uses default values for your network settings. Fine-tune these settings afterwards, either in the CLI as before, or in a new, browser-based wizard.

    - All sensors are installed with a default *support* user and password. Change the default password immediately with the first sign-in.

- **Configure initial setup in the browser**: After installing software and configuring your initial network settings, continue with the same browser-based wizard to activate your sensor and define SSL/TLS certificate settings.

For more information, see [Install and set up your OT sensor](ot-deploy/install-software-ot-sensor.md) and [Configure and activate your OT sensor](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md).

### Analyze and fine tune your deployment

After completing the installation and initial setup, analyze the traffic that the sensor detects by default from the sensor settings. On the sensor, select **Sensor settings** > **Basic** > **Deployment** to analyze the current detections. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored/deployment-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Deployment settings page." lightbox="media/how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored/deployment-settings.png":::

You might find that you need to fine tune your deployment, such as changing the sensor's location in the network, or verifying that your monitoring interfaces are connected correctly. Select **Analyze** again after making any changes to see the updated monitoring state. 

For more information, see [Analyze your deployment](how-to-control-what-traffic-is-monitored.md#analyze-your-deployment).

### Configure monitored interfaces via the sensor GUI

If you want to modify the interfaces used to monitor your traffic after the initial sensor setup, now you can use the new **Sensor settings** > **Interface configurations** page to update your settings instead of the Linux wizard accessed by CLI. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/integration-configurations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Integration configurations page on the OT sensor.":::

The **Interface configurations** page shows the same options as the **Interface configurations** tab in the [initial setup wizard](ot-deploy/activate-deploy-sensor.md#define-the-interfaces-you-want-to-monitor).

For more information, see [Update a sensor's monitoring interfaces (configure ERSPAN)](../how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#update-a-sensors-monitoring-interfaces-configure-erspan).

### Simplified privileged users

In new sensor installations of version 23.1.2, only the privileged *support* user is available by default. The *cyberx* and *cyberx_host* users are available, but are disabled by default. If you need to use these users, such as for [Defender for IoT CLI](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md) access, [change the user password](manage-users-sensor.md#change-a-sensor-users-password).

In sensors that have been updated from previous versions to 23.1.2, the *cyberx* and *cyberx_host* users remain enabled as before.

> [!TIP]
> To run CLI commands that are available only to the *cyberx* or *cyberx_host* users when signed in as the *support* user, make sure to first access the host machine's system root. For more information, see [Access the system root as a *support* user](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md#access-the-system-root-as-a-support-user).

### Migrate to site-based licenses

Existing customers can now migrate their legacy Defender for IoT purchasing plans to a **Microsoft 365** plan, based on site-based, Microsoft 365 licenses.

On the **Plans and pricing** page, edit your plan and select the **Microsoft 365** plan instead of your current monthly or annual plan. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/migrate-to-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot of updating your pricing plan to Microsoft 365."  lightbox="media/release-notes/migrate-to-365.png":::

Make sure to edit any relevant sites to match your newly licensed site sizes. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/edit-site-size.png" alt-text="Screenshot of editing a site size on the Azure portal."  lightbox="media/release-notes/edit-site-size.png":::

For more information, see [Migrate from a legacy OT plan](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md#migrate-from-a-legacy-ot-plan) and [Defender for IoT subscription billing](billing.md).

## June 2023

| **OT networks** | [OT plans billed by site-based licenses](#ot-plans-billed-by-site-based-licenses) <br> [Security recommendations for OT networks for insecure passwords and critical CVEs](#security-recommendations-for-ot-networks-for-insecure-passwords-and-critical-cves) |

### OT plans billed by site-based licenses

Starting June 1, 2023, Microsoft Defender for IoT licenses for OT monitoring are available for purchase only in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home).

- **Licenses are available for individual sites**, based on the sizes of those respective sites. A trial license is also available, covering a **Large** site size for 60 days.

    Any purchase of extra licenses is automatically updated in your OT plan in the Azure portal.

- **When you onboard a new sensor**, you're now requested to assign your sensor to a site that's based on your licensed site sizes.

- **Existing customers** can continue to use any legacy OT plan already onboarded to an Azure subscription, with no changes in functionality. However, you can't add a new plan to a new subscription without a corresponding license from the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!TIP]
> A Defender for IoT *site* is a physical location, such as a facility, campus, office building, hospital, rig, and so on. Each site can contain any number of network sensors, which identify devices across detected network traffic.

### Security recommendations for OT networks for insecure passwords and critical CVEs

Defender for IoT now provides security recommendations for insecure passwords and for critical CVEs to help customers manage their OT/IoT network security posture.

You can see the following new security recommendations from the Azure portal for detected devices across your networks:

- **Secure your vulnerable devices**: Devices with this recommendation are found with one or more vulnerabilities with a critical severity. We recommend that you follow the steps listed by the device vendor or CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency).

- **Set a secure password for devices with missing authentication**: Devices with this recommendation are found without authentication based on successful sign-ins. We recommend that you enable authentication, and that you set a stronger password with minimum length and complexity.

- **Set a stronger password with minimum length and complexity**: Devices with this recommendation are found with weak passwords based on successful sign-ins. We recommend that you change the device password to a stronger password with minimum length and complexity.

For more information, see [Supported security recommendations](recommendations.md#supported-security-recommendations).

:::image type="content" source="media/deployment-paths/ot-deploy.png" alt-text="Diagram of an OT monitoring deployment path." border="false" lightbox="media/deployment-paths/ot-deploy.png":::

The step-by-step instructions in each section are intended to help customers optimize for success and deploy for Zero Trust. Navigational elements on each page, including flow charts at the top and **Next steps** links at the bottom, indicate where you are in the process, what you’ve completed, and what your next step should be. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/deployment-paths/progress-network-level-deployment.png" alt-text="Diagram of a progress bar with Site networking setup highlighted." border="false" lightbox="media/deployment-paths/progress-network-level-deployment.png":::

For more information, see [Deploy Defender for IoT for OT monitoring](ot-deploy/ot-deploy-path.md).

### Proxy support for client SSL/TLS certificates

A client SSL/TLS certificate is required for proxy servers that inspect SSL/TLS traffic, such as when using services like Zscaler and Palo Alto Prisma. Starting in version 22.3.8, you can upload a client certificate through the OT sensor console.

For more information, see [Configure a proxy](connect-sensors.md#configure-proxy-settings-on-an-ot-sensor).

### Enrich Windows workstation and server data with a local script (Public preview)

Use a local script, available from the OT sensor UI, to enrich Microsoft Windows workstation and server data on your OT sensor. The script runs as a utility to detect devices and enrich data, and can be run manually or using standard automation tools.
 
For more information, see [Enrich Windows workstation and server data with a local script](detect-windows-endpoints-script.md).

### Automatically resolved OS notifications

After updating your OT sensor to version 22.3.8, no new device notifications for **Operating system changes** are generated. Existing **Operating system changes** notifications are automatically resolved if they aren't dismissed or otherwise handled within 14 days.

For more information, see [Device notification responses](how-to-work-with-the-sensor-device-map.md#device-notification-responses)

### UI enhancement when uploading SSL/TLS certificates

The OT sensor version 22.3.8 has an enhanced **SSL/TLS Certificates** configuration page for defining your SSL/TLS certificate settings and deploying a CA-signed certificate.

For more information, see [Manage SSL/TLS certificates](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#manage-ssltls-certificates).

### Support for transient devices

Defender for IoT now identifies *transient* devices as a unique device type that represents devices that were detected for only a short time. We recommend investigating these devices carefully to understand their impact on your network.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT device inventory](device-inventory.md) and [Manage your device inventory from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md).

### Learn DNS traffic by configuring allowlists

The *support* user can now decrease the number of unauthorized internet alerts by creating an allowlist of domain names on your OT sensor.

When a DNS allowlist is configured, the sensor checks each unauthorized internet connectivity attempt against the list before triggering an alert. If the domain's FQDN is included in the allowlist, the sensor doesn’t trigger the alert and allows the traffic automatically.

All OT sensor users can view the list of allowed DNS domains and their resolved IP addresses in data mining reports.  

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/data-mining-allowlist.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to create a data mining report for DNS allowlists.":::

For more information, see [Allow internet connections on an OT network](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#allow-internet-connections-on-an-ot-network) and [Create data mining queries](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md).

### Device data retention updates

The device data retention period on the OT sensor and on-premises management console has been updated to 90 days from the date of the **Last activity** value.

For more information, see [Device data retention periods](references-data-retention.md#device-data-retention-periods).

### UI enhancements when uploading SSL/TLS certificates

The OT sensor version 22.3.6 has an enhanced **SSL/TLS Certificates** configuration page for defining your SSL/TLS certificate settings and deploying a CA-signed certificate.

For more information, see [Manage SSL/TLS certificates](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#manage-ssltls-certificates).

### Activation files expiration updates

Activation files on locally managed OT sensors now remain activated for as long as your Defender for IoT plan is active on your Azure subscription, just like activation files on cloud-connected OT sensors.

You only need to update your activation file if you're [updating an OT sensor from a legacy version](update-legacy-ot-software.md#update-legacy-ot-sensor-software) or switching the sensor management mode, such as moving from locally managed to cloud-connected.

For more information, see [Manage individual sensors](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md).

### UI enhancements for managing the device inventory

The following enhancements were added to the OT sensor's device inventory in version 22.3.6:

- A smoother process for [editing device details](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md#edit-device-details) on the OT sensor. Edit device details directly from the device inventory page on the OT sensor console using the new **Edit** button in the toolbar at the top of the page.
- The OT sensor now supports [deleting multiple devices](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md#delete-devices) simultaneously.
- The procedures for [merging](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md#merge-devices) and [deleting](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md#delete-devices) devices now include confirmation messages that appear when the action has completed.

For more information, see [Manage your OT device inventory from a sensor console](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md).

### Updated severity for all Suspicion of Malicious Activity alerts

All alerts with the **Suspicion of Malicious Activity** category now have a severity of **Critical**.

For more information, see [Malware engine alerts](alert-engine-messages.md#malware-engine-alerts).

### Automatically resolved device notifications

Starting in version 22.3.6, selected notifications on the OT sensor's **Device map** page are now automatically resolved if they aren't dismissed or otherwise handled within 14 days.

After updating your sensor version, the **Inactive devices** and **New OT devices** notifications no longer appear. While any **Inactive devices** notifications that are left over from before the update are automatically dismissed, you may still have legacy **New OT devices** notifications to handle. Handle these notifications as needed to remove them from your sensor.

For more information, see [Manage device notifications](how-to-work-with-the-sensor-device-map.md#manage-device-notifications).

### New Microsoft Sentinel incident experience for Defender for IoT

Microsoft Sentinel's new [incident experience](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/the-new-incident-experience-is-here/ba-p/3717042) includes specific features for Defender for IoT customers. When investigating OT/IoT-related incidents, SOC analysts can now use the following enhancements on incident details pages:

- **View related sites, zones, sensors, and device importance** to better understand an incident's business impact and physical location.

- **Review an aggregated timeline of affected devices and related device details**, instead of investigating on separate entity details pages for the related devices

### Security recommendations for OT networks (Public preview)

Defender for IoT now provides security recommendations to help customers manage their OT/IoT network security posture. Defender for IoT recommendations help users form actionable, prioritized mitigation plans that address the unique challenges of OT/IoT networks. Use recommendations for lower your network's risk and attack surface.

You can see the following security recommendations from the Azure portal for detected devices across your networks:

- **Review PLC operating mode**. Devices with this recommendation are found with PLCs set to unsecure operating mode states. We recommend setting PLC operating modes to the **Secure Run** state if access is no longer required to the PLC to reduce the threat of malicious PLC programming.

- **Review unauthorized devices**. Devices with this recommendation must be identified and authorized as part of the network baseline. We recommend taking action to identify any indicated devices. Disconnect any devices from your network that remain unknown even after investigation to reduce the threat of rogue or potentially malicious devices.

Access security recommendations from one of the following locations:

- The **Recommendations** page, which displays all current recommendations across all detected OT devices.

- The **Recommendations** tab on a device details page, which displays all current recommendations for the selected device.

From either location, select a recommendation to drill down further and view lists of all detected OT devices that are currently in a *healthy* or *unhealthy* state, according to the selected recommendation. From the **Unhealthy devices** or **Healthy devices** tab, select a device link to jump to the selected device details page. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/recommendations.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Review PLC operating mode recommendation page.":::

For more information, see [View the device inventory](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md#view-the-device-inventory) and [Enhance security posture with security recommendations](recommendations.md).

### Device vulnerabilities from the Azure portal (Public preview)

Defender for IoT now provides vulnerability data in the Azure portal for detected OT network devices. Vulnerability data is based on the repository of standards based vulnerability data documented at the [US government National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/national-vulnerability-database-nvd).

Access vulnerability data in the Azure portal from the following locations:

- On a device details page, select the **Vulnerabilities** tab to view current vulnerabilities on the selected device. For example, from the **Device inventory** page, select a specific device and then select **Vulnerabilities**.

    For more information, see [View the device inventory](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md#view-the-device-inventory).

- A new **Vulnerabilities** workbook displays vulnerability data across all monitored OT devices. Use the **Vulnerabilities** workbook to view data like CVE by severity or vendor, and full lists of detected vulnerabilities and vulnerable devices and components.

    Select an item in the **Device vulnerabilities**, **Vulnerable devices**, or **Vulnerable components** tables to view related information in the tables on the right.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/vulnerabilities-workbook.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Vulnerabilities workbook in Defender for IoT.":::

    For more information, see [Use Azure Monitor workbooks in Microsoft Defender for IoT](workbooks.md).

### Updates for Azure cloud connection firewall rules (Public preview)

OT network sensors connect to Azure to provide alert and device data and sensor health messages, access threat intelligence packages, and more. Connected Azure services include IoT Hub, Blob Storage, Event Hubs, and the Microsoft Download Center.

For OT sensors with software versions 22.x and higher, Defender for IoT now supports increased security when adding outbound allow rules for connections to Azure. Now you can define your outbound allow rules to connect to Azure without using wildcards.

When defining outbound allow rules to connect to Azure, you need to enable HTTPS traffic to each of the required endpoints on port 443. Outbound allow rules are defined once for all OT sensors onboarded to the same subscription.

For supported sensor versions, download the full list of required secure endpoints from the following locations in the Azure portal:

- **A successful sensor registration page**: After onboarding a new OT sensor, version 22.x, the successful registration page now provides instructions for next steps, including a link to the endpoints you'll need to add as secure outbound allow rules on your network. Select the **Download endpoint details** link to download the JSON file.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/download-endpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a successful OT sensor registration page with the download endpoints link.":::

- **The Sites and sensors page**: Select an OT sensor with software versions 22.x or higher, or a site with one or more supported sensor versions. Then, select **More actions** > **Download endpoint details** to download the JSON file. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/download-endpoints-sites-sensors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sites and sensors page with the download endpoint details link.":::

- [Manage sensors with Defender for IoT in the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md)
- [Networking requirements](networking-requirements.md#sensor-access-to-azure-portal)

### Investigation enhancements with IoT device entities in Microsoft Sentinel

Defender for IoT's integration with Microsoft Sentinel now supports an IoT device entity page. When investigating incidents and monitoring IoT security in Microsoft Sentinel, you can now identify your most sensitive devices and jump directly to more details on each device entity page.

The IoT device entity page provides contextual device information about an IoT device, with basic device details and device owner contact information. Device owners are defined by site in the **Sites and sensors** page in Defender for IoT.

The IoT device entity page can help prioritize remediation based on device importance and business impact, as per each alert's site, zone, and sensor. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/iot-device-entity-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the IoT device entity page in Microsoft Sentinel.":::

You can also now hunt for vulnerable devices on the Microsoft Sentinel **Entity behavior** page. For example, view the top five IoT devices with the highest number of alerts, or search for a device by IP address or device name:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/entity-behavior-iot-devices-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Entity behavior page in Microsoft Sentinel.":::

For more information, see [Investigate further with IoT device entities](../../sentinel/iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md#investigate-further-with-iot-device-entities) and [Site management options from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#site-management-options-from-the-azure-portal).

### Updates to the Microsoft Defender for IoT solution in Microsoft Sentinel's content hub

This month, we've released version 2.0 of the **Microsoft Defender for IoT** solution in Microsoft Sentinel's content hub, previously known as the **IoT/OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution.

Updates in this version of the solution include:

- **A name change**. If you'd previously installed the **IoT/OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, the solution is automatically renamed to **Microsoft Defender for IoT**, even if you don't update the solution.

- **Workbook improvements**: The **Defender for IoT** workbook now includes:

    - A new **Overview** dashboard with key metrics on the device inventory, threat detection, and security posture. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Overview tab in the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT workbook." lightbox="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-overview.png":::

    - A new **Vulnerabilities** dashboard with details about CVEs shown in your network and their related vulnerable devices. For example:

        :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-vulnerabilities.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Vulnerability tab in the IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT workbook." lightbox="media/release-notes/sentinel-workbook-vulnerabilities.png":::

    - Improvements on the **Device inventory** dashboard, including access to device recommendations, vulnerabilities, and direct links to the Defender for IoT device details pages. The **Device inventory** dashboard in the **IoT/OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** workbook is fully aligned with the Defender for IoT [device inventory data](how-to-manage-device-inventory-for-organizations.md).

- **Playbook updates**: The **Microsoft Defender for IoT** solution now supports the following SOC automation functionality with new playbooks:

  - **Automation with CVE details**: Use the *AD4IoT-CVEAutoWorkflow* playbook to enrich incident comments with CVEs of related devices based on Defender for IoT data. The incidents are triaged, and if the CVE is critical, the asset owner is notified about the incident by email.

  - **Automation for email notifications to device owners**. Use the *AD4IoT-SendEmailtoIoTOwner* playbook to have a notification email automatically sent to a device's owner about new incidents. Device owners can then reply to the email to update the incident as needed. Device owners are defined at the site level in Defender for IoT.

  - **Automation for incidents with sensitive devices**:  Use the *AD4IoT-AutoTriageIncident* playbook to automatically update an incident's severity based on the devices involved in the incident, and their sensitivity level or importance to your organization. For example, any incident involving a sensitive device can be automatically escalated to a higher severity level.

For more information, see [Investigate Microsoft Defender for IoT incidents with Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md?bc=%2fazure%2fdefender-for-iot%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fazure%2fdefender-for-iot%2forganizations%2ftoc.json).

### Enterprise IoT and Defender for Endpoint integration in GA

The Enterprise IoT integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is now in General Availability (GA). With this update, we've made the following updates and improvements:

- Onboard an Enterprise IoT plan directly in Defender for Endpoint. For more information, see [Manage your subscriptions](how-to-manage-subscriptions.md) and the [Defender for Endpoint documentation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration).

- Seamless integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to view detected Enterprise IoT devices, and their related alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations in the Microsoft 365 Security portal. For more information, see the [Enterprise IoT tutorial](tutorial-getting-started-eiot-sensor.md) and the [Defender for Endpoint documentation](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/enable-microsoft-defender-for-iot-integration). You can continue to view detected Enterprise IoT devices on the Defender for IoT **Device inventory** page in the Azure portal.

- All Enterprise IoT sensors are now automatically added to the same site in Defender for IoT, named **Enterprise network**. When onboarding a new Enterprise IoT device, you only need to define a sensor name and select your subscription, without defining a site or zone.

> [!NOTE]
> The Enterprise IoT network sensor and all detections remain in Public Preview.

### Same passwords for cyberx_host and cyberx users

During OT monitoring software installations and updates, the **cyberx** user is assigned a random password. When updating from version 10.x.x to version 22.1.7, the **cyberx_host** password is assigned with an identical password to the **cyberx** user.

For more information, see [Install OT agentless monitoring software](how-to-install-software.md) and [Update Defender for IoT OT monitoring software](update-ot-software.md).

### Device inventory enhancements

Starting in OT sensor versions 22.2.4, you can now take the following actions from the sensor console's **Device inventory** page:

- **Merge duplicate devices**. You may need to merge devices if the sensor has discovered separate network entities that are associated with a single, unique device. Examples of this scenario might include a PLC with four network cards, a laptop with both WiFi and a physical network card, or a single workstation with multiple network cards.

- **Delete single devices**. Now, you can delete a single device that hasn't communicated for at least 10 minutes.

- **Delete inactive devices by admin users**. Now, all admin users, in addition to the **cyberx** user, can delete inactive devices.

Also starting in version 22.2.4, in the sensor console's **Device inventory** page, the **Last seen** value in the device details pane is replaced by **Last activity**. For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/last-activity-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Last activity field showing in the sensor console's device details pane on the Device inventory page.":::

For more information, see [Manage your OT device inventory from a sensor console](how-to-investigate-sensor-detections-in-a-device-inventory.md).

### Enhancements for the ServiceNow integration API

OT sensor version 22.2.4 provides enhancements for the `devicecves` API, which gets details about the CVEs found for a given device.

Now you can add any of the following parameters to your query to fine tune your results:

- “**sensorId**” - Shows results from a specific sensor, as defined by the given sensor ID.
- “**score**” - Determines a minimum CVE score to be retrieved. All results have a CVE score equal to or higher than the given value. Default = **0**.
- “**deviceIds**” -  A comma-separated list of device IDs from which you want to show results. For example: **1232,34,2,456**

For more information, see [Integration API reference for on-premises management consoles (Public preview)](api/management-integration-apis.md).

### OT appliance hardware profile updates

We've refreshed the naming conventions for our OT appliance hardware profiles for greater transparency and clarity.

The new names reflect both the *type* of profile, including *Corporate*, *Enterprise*, and *Production line*, and also the related disk storage size.

Use the following table to understand the mapping between legacy hardware profile names and the current names used in the updated software installation:

|Legacy name  |New name  | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|**Corporate**     |    **C5600** | A *Corporate* environment, with: <br>16 Cores<br>32-GB RAM<br>5.6-TB disk storage |
|**Enterprise**     | **E1800** | An *Enterprise* environment, with: <br>Eight Cores<br>32-GB RAM<br>1.8-TB disk storage        |
|**SMB**    |    **L500**   | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>Four Cores<br>8-GB RAM<br>500-GB disk storage  |
|**Office**     | **L100**  | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>Four Cores<br>8-GB RAM<br>100-GB disk storage      |
|**Rugged**     |   **L64** | A *Production line* environment, with: <br>Four Cores<br>8-GB RAM<br>64-GB disk storage     |

We also now support new enterprise hardware profiles, for sensors supporting both 500 GB and 1-TB disk sizes.

For more information, see [Which appliances do I need?](ot-appliance-sizing.md)

### PCAP access from the Azure portal (Public preview)

Now you can access the raw traffic files, known as packet capture files or PCAP files, directly from the Azure portal. This feature supports SOC or OT security engineers who want to investigate alerts from Defender for IoT or Microsoft Sentinel, without having to access each sensor separately.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Download PCAP button." lightbox="media/release-notes/pcap-request.png":::

PCAP files are downloaded to your Azure storage.

For more information, see [View and manage alerts from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md).

### Bi-directional alert synch between sensors and the Azure portal (Public preview)

For sensors updated to version 22.2.1, alert statuses and learn statuses are now fully synchronized between the sensor console and the Azure portal. For example, this means that you can close an alert on the Azure portal or the sensor console, and the alert status is updated in both locations.

*Learn* an alert from either the Azure portal or the sensor console to ensure that it's not triggered again the next time the same network traffic is detected.

The sensor console is also synchronized with an on-premises management console, so that alert statuses and learn statuses remain up-to-date across your management interfaces.

For more information, see:

- [View and manage alerts from the Azure portal](how-to-manage-cloud-alerts.md)
- [View and manage alerts on your sensor](how-to-view-alerts.md)
- [Work with alerts on the on-premises management console](how-to-work-with-alerts-on-premises-management-console.md)

### Sensor connections restored after certificate rotation

Starting in version 22.2.3, after rotating your certificates, your sensor connections are automatically restored to your on-premises management console, and you don't need to reconnect them manually.

For more information, see [Create SSL/TLS certificates for OT appliances](ot-deploy/create-ssl-certificates.md) and [Manage SSL/TLS certificates](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#manage-ssltls-certificates).

### Support diagnostic log enhancements (Public preview)

Starting in sensor version [22.1.1](#new-support-diagnostics-log), you've been able to download a diagnostic log from the sensor console to send to support when you open a ticket.

Now, for locally managed sensors, you can upload that diagnostic log directly on the Azure portal.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Send diagnostic files to support option." lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/upload-diagnostics-log.png":::

### Improved security for uploading protocol plugins

This version of the sensor provides an improved security for uploading proprietary plugins you've created using the Horizon SDK.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/horizon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Protocols DPI (Horizon Plugins) page." lightbox="media/release-notes/horizon.png":::

For more information, see [Manage proprietary protocols with Horizon plugins](resources-manage-proprietary-protocols.md).

### Sensor names shown in browser tabs

Starting in sensor version 22.2.3, your sensor's name is displayed in the browser tab, making it easier for you to identify the sensors you're working with.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/sensor-name-in-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor name shown in the browser tab.":::

For more information, see [Manage individual sensors](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md).

### Microsoft Sentinel incident synch with Defender for IoT alerts

The **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution now ensures that alerts in Defender for IoT are updated with any related incident **Status** changes from Microsoft Sentinel.

This synchronization overrides any status defined in Defender for IoT, in the Azure portal or the sensor console, so that the alert statuses match that of the related incident.

Update your **IoT OT Threat Monitoring with Defender for IoT** solution to use the latest synchronization support, including the new **AD4IoT-AutoAlertStatusSync** playbook. After updating the solution, make sure that you also take the [required steps](../../sentinel/iot-advanced-threat-monitoring.md?#update-alert-statuses-in-defender-for-iot) to ensure that the new playbook works as expected.

Now, when installing a new sensor or a new sensor version, our installation wizard provides a streamlined interface to do all these tasks from a single location.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md).

### Sensor redesign and unified Microsoft product experience

The Defender for IoT sensor console has been redesigned to create a unified Microsoft Azure experience and enhance and simplify workflows.

These features are now Generally Available (GA). Updates include the general look and feel, drill-down panes, search and action options, and more. For example:

**Simplified workflows include**:

- The **Device inventory** page now includes detailed device pages. Select a device in the table and then select **View full details** on the right.

    :::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/device-inventory-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the View full details button." lightbox="media/release-notes/device-inventory-details.png":::

- Properties updated from the sensor's inventory are now automatically updated in the cloud device inventory.

- The device details pages, accessed either from the **Device map** or **Device inventory** pages, is shown as read only. To modify device properties, select **Edit properties** on the bottom-left.

- The **Data mining** page now includes reporting functionality. While the **Reports** page was removed, users with read-only access can view updates on the **Data mining page** without the ability to modify reports or settings.

    For admin users creating new reports, you can now toggle on a **Send to CM** option to send the report to a central management console as well. For more information, see [Create a report](how-to-create-data-mining-queries.md#create-an-ot-sensor-custom-data-mining-report)

- The **System settings** area has been reorganized in to sections for *Basic* settings, settings for *Network monitoring*, *Sensor management*, *Integrations*, and *Import settings*.

- The sensor online help now links to key articles in the Microsoft Defender for IoT documentation.

**Defender for IoT maps now include**:

- A new **Map View** is now shown for alerts and on the device details pages, showing where in your environment the alert or device is found.

- Right-click a device on the map to view contextual information about the device, including related alerts, event timeline data, and connected devices.

- Select **Disable Display IT Networks Groups** to prevent the ability to collapse IT networks in the map. This option is turned on by default.

- The **Simplified Map View** option has been removed.

We've also implemented global readiness and accessibility features to comply with Microsoft standards. In the on-premises sensor console, these updates include both high contrast and regular screen display themes and localization for over 15 languages.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/dark-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sensor console in dark mode." lightbox="media/release-notes/dark-mode.png":::

Access global readiness and accessibility options from the **Settings** icon at the top-right corner of your screen:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/settings-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows localization options." lightbox="media/release-notes/settings-icon.png":::

### Enhanced sensor Overview page

The Defender for IoT sensor portal's **Dashboard** page has been renamed as **Overview**, and now includes data that better highlights system deployment details, critical network monitoring health, top alerts, and important trends and statistics.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/new-interface.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the updated interface." lightbox="media/release-notes/new-interface.png":::

The Overview page also now serves as a *black box* to view your overall sensor status in case your outbound connections, such as to the Azure portal, go down.

Create more dashboards using the **Trends & Statistics** page, located under the **Analyze** menu on the left.

### New support diagnostics log

Now you can get a summary of the log and system information that gets added to your support tickets. In the **Backup and Restore** dialog, select **Support Ticket Diagnostics**.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/support-ticket-diagnostics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Backup and Restore dialog showing the Support Ticket Diagnostics option." lightbox="media/release-notes/support-ticket-diagnostics.png":::

For more information, see [Download a diagnostics log for support](how-to-troubleshoot-sensor.md#download-a-diagnostics-log-for-support)

### Alert updates

**In the Azure portal**:

Alerts are now available in Defender for IoT in the Azure portal. Work with alerts to enhance the security and operation of your IoT/OT network.

The new **Alerts** page is currently in Public Preview, and provides:

- An aggregated, real-time view of threats detected by network sensors.
- Remediation steps for devices and network processes.
- Streaming alerts to Microsoft Sentinel and empower your SOC team.
- Alert storage for 90 days from the time they're first detected.
- Tools to investigate source and destination activity, alert severity and status, MITRE ATT&CK information, and contextual information about the alert.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/mitre.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Alerts page showing MITRE information." lightbox="media/release-notes/mitre.png":::

**On the sensor console**:

On the sensor console, the **Alerts** page now shows details for alerts detected by sensors that are configured with a cloud-connection to Defender for IoT on Azure. Users working with alerts in both Azure and on-premises should understand how alerts are managed between the Azure portal and the on-premises components.

:::image type="content" source="media/release-notes/alerts-in-console.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new Alerts page on the sensor console." lightbox="media/release-notes/alerts-in-console.png":::

Other alert updates include:

- **Access contextual data** for each alert, such as events that occurred around the same time, or a map of connected devices. Maps of connected devices are available for sensor console alerts only.

- **Alert statuses** are updated, and, for example,  now include a *Closed* status instead of *Acknowledged*.

- **Alert storage** for 90 days from the time that they're first detected.

- The **Backup Activity with Antivirus Signatures Alert**. This new alert warning is triggered for traffic detected between a source device and destination backup server, which is often legitimate backup activity. Critical or major malware alerts are no longer triggered for such activity.

- **During upgrades**, sensor console alerts that are currently archived are deleted. Pinned alerts are no longer supported, so pins are removed for sensor console alerts as relevant.

For more information, see [View alerts on your sensor](how-to-view-alerts.md).

### Custom alert updates

The sensor console's **Custom alert rules** page now provides:

- Hit count information in the **Custom alert rules** table, with at-a-glance details about the number of alerts triggered in the last week for each rule you've created.

- The ability to schedule custom alert rules to run outside of regular working hours.

- The ability to alert on any field that can be extracted from a protocol using the DPI engine.

- Complete protocol support when creating custom rules, and support for an extensive range of related protocol variables.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/protocol-support-custom-alerts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the updated Custom alerts dialog. "lightbox="media/how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud/protocol-support-custom-alerts.png":::

For more information, see [Create custom alert rules on an OT sensor](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#create-custom-alert-rules-on-an-ot-sensor).

### CLI command updates

The Defender for Iot sensor software installation is now containerized. With the now-containerized sensor, you can use the *cyberx_host* user to investigate issues with other containers or the operating system, or to send files via FTP.

This *cyberx_host* user is available by default and connects to the host machine. If you need to, recover the password for the *cyberx_host* user from the **Sites and sensors** page in Defender for IoT.

As part of the containerized sensor, the following CLI commands have been modified:

|Legacy name  |Replacement  |
|---------|---------|
|`cyberx-xsense-reconfigure-interfaces`    |`sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`         |
|`cyberx-xsense-reload-interfaces`     |  `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`      |
|`cyberx-xsense-reconfigure-hostname`     | `sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor`       |
| `cyberx-xsense-system-remount-disks` |`sudo dpkg-reconfigure iot-sensor` |

The `sudo cyberx-xsense-limit-interface-I eth0 -l value` CLI command was removed. This command was used to limit the interface bandwidth that the sensor uses for day-to-day procedures, and is no longer supported.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md), [Work with Defender for IoT CLI commands](references-work-with-defender-for-iot-cli-commands.md), and [CLI command reference from OT network sensors](cli-ot-sensor.md).

### Update to version 22.1.x

To use all of Defender for IoT's latest features, make sure to update your sensor software versions to 22.1.x.

If you're on a legacy version, you may need to run a series of updates in order to get to the latest version. You'll also need to update your firewall rules and reactivate your sensor with a new activation file.

After you've upgraded to version 22.1.x, the new upgrade log can be found at the following path, accessed via SSH and the *cyberx_host* user: `/opt/sensor/logs/legacy-upgrade.log`.

For more information, see [Update OT system software](update-ot-software.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading to version 22.1.x is a large update, and you should expect the update process to require more time than previous updates.
>

### New connectivity model and firewall requirements

Defender for IoT version 22.1.x supports a new set of sensor connection methods that provide simplified deployment, improved security, scalability, and flexible connectivity.

In addition to [migration steps](update-legacy-ot-software.md#migrate-a-cloud-connection-from-the-legacy-method), this new connectivity model requires that you open a new firewall rule. For more information, see:

- **New firewall requirements**: [Sensor access to Azure portal](networking-requirements.md#sensor-access-to-azure-portal).
- **Architecture**: [Sensor connection methods](architecture-connections.md)
- **Connection procedures**: [Connect your sensors to Microsoft Defender for IoT](connect-sensors.md)

### Protocol improvements

This version of Defender for IoT provides improved support for:

- Profinet DCP
- Honeywell
- Windows endpoint detection

For more information, see [Microsoft Defender for IoT - supported IoT, OT, ICS, and SCADA protocols](concept-supported-protocols.md).

### Modified, replaced, or removed options and configurations

The following Defender for IoT options and configurations have been moved, removed, and/or replaced:

- Reports previously found on the **Reports** page are now shown on the **Data Mining** page instead. You can also continue to view data mining information directly from the on-premises management console.

- Changing a locally managed sensor name is now supported only by onboarding the sensor to the Azure portal again with the new name. Sensor names can no longer be changed directly from the sensor. For more information, see [Upload a new activation file](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#upload-a-new-activation-file).
