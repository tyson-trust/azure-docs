# Forward on-premises OT alert information

Microsoft Defender for IoT alerts enhance your network security and operations with real-time details about events logged in your network. OT alerts are triggered when OT network sensors detect changes or suspicious activity in network traffic that needs your attention.

This article describes how to configure your OT sensor or on-premises management console to forward alerts to partner services, syslog servers, email addresses, and more. Forwarded alert information includes details like:

:::row:::
    :::column:::
    - Date and time of the alert
    - Engine that detected the event
    - Alert title and descriptive message
    - Alert severity
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    - Source and destination name and IP address
    - Suspicious traffic detected
    - Disconnected sensors
    - Remote backup failures
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

> [!NOTE]
> Forwarding alert rules run only on alerts triggered after the forwarding rule is created. Alerts already in the system from before the forwarding rule was created are not affected by the rule.

## Prerequisites

- Depending on where you want to create your forwarding alert rules, you'll need to have either an [OT network sensor or on-premises management console installed](how-to-install-software.md), with access as an **Admin** user.

    For more information, see [Install OT agentless monitoring software](how-to-install-software.md) and [On-premises users and roles for OT monitoring with Defender for IoT](roles-on-premises.md).

- You'll also need to define SMTP settings on the OT sensor or on-premises management console.

    For more information, see [Configure SMTP mail server settings on an OT sensor](how-to-manage-individual-sensors.md#configure-smtp-mail-server-settings) and [Configure SMTP mail server settings on the on-premises management console](how-to-manage-the-on-premises-management-console.md#configure-smtp-mail-server-settings).

## Create forwarding rules on an OT sensor

1. Sign into the OT sensor and select **Forwarding** on the left-hand menu > **+ Create new rule**.

1. In the **Add forwarding rule** pane, enter a meaningful rule name, and then define rule conditions and actions as follows:

    |Name  |Description  |
    |---------|---------|
    |**Minimal alert level**     | Select the minimum [alert severity level](alert-engine-messages.md#alert-severities) you want to forward. <br><br>  For example, if you select **Minor**, minor alerts and any alert above this severity level will be forwarded.     |
    |**Any protocol detected**     | Toggle on to forward alerts from all protocol traffic or toggle off and select the specific protocols you want to include.        |
    |**Traffic detected by any engine**     |  Toggle on to forward alerts from all [analytics engines](architecture.md#defender-for-iot-analytics-engines), or toggle off and select the specific engines you want to include.             |
    |**Actions**     | Select the type of server you want to forward alerts to, and then define any other required information for that server type. <br><br>To add multiple servers to the same rule, select **+ Add server** and add more details. <br><br>For more information, see [Configure alert forwarding rule actions](#configure-alert-forwarding-rule-actions).   |

1. When you're done configuring the rule, select **Save**. The rule is listed on the **Forwarding** page.

### Webhook server action

**Supported from the on-premises management console only**

Configure a **Webhook** action to configure an integration that subscribes to Defender for IoT alert events. For example, send alert data to a webhook server to update an external SIEM system, SOAR system, or incident management system.

When you've configured alerts to be forwarded to a webhook server and an alert event is triggered, the on-premises management console sends an HTTP POST payload to the configured webhook URL.

In the **Actions** area, enter the following details:

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Server**     | Select **Webhook**.        |
|**URL**     | Enter the webhook server URL.        |
|**Key / Value**    | Enter key/value pairs to customize the HTTP header as needed. Supported characters include: <br>- **Keys** can contain only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. <br>- **Values** can contain only one leading and/or trailing space.  |

### Webhook extended

**Supported from the on-premises management console only**

Configure a **Webhook extended** action to send the following extra data to your webhook server:

- sensorID
- sensorName
- zoneID
- zoneName
- siteID
- siteName
- sourceDeviceAddress
- destinationDeviceAddress
- remediationSteps
- handled
- additionalInformation

In the **Actions** area, enter the following details:

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Server**     | Select **Webhook extended**.        |
|**URL**     | Enter the endpoint data URL.        |
|**Key / Value**    | Enter key/value pairs to customize the HTTP header as needed. Supported characters include: <br>- **Keys** can contain only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. <br>- **Values** can contain only one leading and/or trailing space.  |

### NetWitness action

Configure a **NetWitness** action to send alert information to a NetWitness server.

In the **Actions** area, enter the following details:

|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Server**     | Select **NetWitness**.        |
|**Hostname / Port**     | Enter the NetWitness server's hostname and port. |
|**Time zone**    | Enter the time zone you want to use in the time stamp for the alert detection at the SIEM. |

### Other partner server integrations

You may be integrating Defender for IoT with a partner service to send alert or device inventory information to another security or device management system, or to communicate with partner-side firewalls.

[Partner integrations](integrate-overview.md) can help to bridge previously siloed security solutions, enhance device visibility, and accelerate system-wide response to more rapidly mitigate risks.

In such cases, use the **Actions** area to enter credentials and other information required to communicate with integrated partner services.

## Configure alert groups in partner services

When you configure forwarding rules to send alert data to Syslog servers, QRadar, and ArcSight, *alert groups* are automatically applied and are available in those partner servers.

*Alert groups* help SOC teams using those partner solutions to manage alerts based on enterprise security policies and business priorities. For example, alerts about new detections are organized into a *discovery* group, and will include any alerts about new devices, VLANs, user accounts, MAC addresses, and more.

Alert groups appear in partner services with the following prefixes:

|Prefix  |Partner service  |
|---------|---------|
|`cat`     |  [QRadar](tutorial-qradar.md), [ArcSight](integrations/arcsight.md), [Syslog CEF](#syslog-cef-output-fields), [Syslog LEEF](#syslog-leef-output-fields)       |
|`Alert Group`     |   [Syslog text messages](#syslog-text-message-output-fields)      |
|`alert_group`     | [Syslog objects](#syslog-object-output-fields)        |

To use alert groups in your integration, make sure to configure your partner services to display the alert group name.

By default, alerts are grouped as follows:

:::row:::
    :::column:::
    - Abnormal communication behavior
    - Custom alerts
    - Remote access
    - Abnormal HTTP communication behavior
    - Discovery
    - Restart and stop commands
    - Authentication
    - Firmware change
    - Scan
    - Unauthorized communication behavior
    - Illegal commands
    :::column-end:::
    :::column:::
    - Sensor traffic
    - Bandwidth anomalies
    - Internet access
    - Suspicion of malware
    - Buffer overflow
    - Operation failures
    - Suspicion of malicious activity
    - Command failures
    - Operational issues
    - Configuration changes
    - Programming
    :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

For more information and to create custom alert groups, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/productselection?sapId=82c8f35-1b8e-f274-ec11-c6efdd6dd099).

## Troubleshoot forwarding rules

If your forwarding alert rules aren't working as expected, check the following details:

- **Certificate validation**. Forwarding rules for [Syslog CEF](#syslog-server-actions), [Microsoft Sentinel](integrate-overview.md#microsoft-sentinel), and [QRadar](tutorial-qradar.md) support encryption and certificate validation.

    If your OT sensors or on-premises management console are configured to [validate certificates](ot-deploy/create-ssl-certificates.md#verify-crl-server-access) and the certificate can't be verified, the alerts aren't forwarded.

    In these cases, the sensor or on-premises management console is the session's client and initiator. Certificates are typically received from the server or use asymmetric encryption, where a specific certificate is provided to set up the integration.

- **Alert exclusion rules**. If you have exclusion rules configured on your on-premises management console, your sensors might be ignoring the alerts you're trying to forward. For more information, see [Create alert exclusion rules on an on-premises management console](how-to-accelerate-alert-incident-response.md#create-alert-exclusion-rules-on-an-on-premises-management-console).
