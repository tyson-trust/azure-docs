# Create OT sites and zones on an on-premises management console

This article is one in a series of articles describing the [deployment path](air-gapped-deploy.md) for a Microsoft Defender for IoT on-premises management console for air-gapped OT sensors.

This article describes how to create sites and zones on an on-premises management console, based on the network segments you've identified across your OT environments.

Segmenting your network by sites and zones is an integral part of implementing a [Zero Trust security strategy](../concept-zero-trust.md), and assigning sensors to specific sites and zones helps you monitor for unauthorized traffic crossing segments.

Data ingested from sensors in the same site or zone can be viewed together, segmented out from other data in your system.

If there's sensor data that you want to view grouped together in the same site or zone, make sure to assign sensor sites and zones accordingly.

An on-premises management console adds the extra layers of *business units* and *regions* to your network segmentation, and also provides an interactive, global map to view all business units, regions, sites, and zones across your network.

> [!NOTE]
> Sites and zones created in on an on-premises management console aren't synchronized with sites and zones created in the Azure portal when [onboarding OT sensors](../onboard-sensors.md#onboard-an-ot-sensor).

## Prerequisites

- A clear understanding of where your OT network sensors are placed in your network, and how you want to [segment your network into sites and zones](../concept-zero-trust.md).

- An on-premises management console [installed](install-software-on-premises-management-console.md) and [activated](activate-deploy-management.md)

- OT sensors [connected to your on-premises management console](connect-sensors-to-management.md)

## Customize your global map (optional)

By default, the on-premises management console shows a blank world map for you to build and monitor your business units, regions, sites, and zones.

For example, you may want to highlight specific countries/regions or cities in more detail so that you can zoom in farther.

**To change the default map to one of your own**:

1. Sign into the on-premises management console and select **System Settings** > **Change Site Map**.

1. Select **UPLOAD SITE MAP** and then browse to and select the image you want to use instead.

## Create business units

Defender for IoT business units represent the business units in your organization. For example, if your company manufactures both clothing and luggage, you might create two business units: **Clothing** and **Luggage**.

1. Sign into your on-premises management console, and select **Enterprise View**.

1. From the toolbar, select **All Sites** > **Manage Business Units**.

1. In the **Manage Business Units** dialog, enter the name of a new business unit and then select **Add**. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/manage-business-units.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage Business Units dialog." lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/manage-business-units.png":::

    Repeat this step for any extra business units you want to create.

1. When you're finished, select **CLOSE** to save your changes.

## Create regions

Defender for IoT regions represent the global regions where your organization has offices, factories, or other sites connected to the network.

1. Sign into your on-premises management console, and select **Enterprise View**.

1. From the toolbar, select **All Regions** > **Manage Regions**.

1. In the **Manage Regions** dialog, enter the name of a new region then select **Add**. For example, if your company has offices all around the world, you might create a region to represent each global region.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/manage-regions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Manage Regions dialog."  lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/manage-regions.png":::

    Repeat this step for any extra sites you want to create.

1. When you're finished, select **CLOSE** to save your changes.

## Create sites

Each Defender for IoT site represents a physical location where your organization has an office, factory, or other building or area connected to your network.

For example, if you have multiple offices in the same city, you'd create a separate site for each office.

1. Sign into your on-premises management console, and select **Enterprise View**.

1. At the top right, select **+ New Site**, and then select a location in the map where you want to define your new site.

1. In the **Create New Site** dialog, enter and select the following values:

    - **Site Name**: Enter a meaningful name for your site.
    - **Site Physical Address**: Enter the physical address of your site's location.
    - **Business Units**: Select one or more Defender for IoT business units represented at the site you're creating.
    - **Region**: Select the region where your site is located.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/new-site.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create New Site dialog." lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/new-site.png":::

    Select **Save** to save your changes.

1. Repeat the previous two steps for each of the sites you want to create, populating the map to cover your entire network. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/enterprise-map-sample.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a populated Enterprise View map." lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/enterprise-map-sample.png":::

## Create zones

Each Defender for IoT zone represents a logical entity in a specific site. For example, you might want to create separate zones for production lines, substations, or device types.

**Prerequisites**: At least one or more [Defender for IoT sites](#create-sites) configured on your on-premises management console.

1. Sign into your on-premises management console, and select **Site Management**.

1. For each site, select **+ Add zone** in the upper-right corner. For example:

    :::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/add-zone-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Add zone button on the Site Management page." lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/add-zone-button.png":::

1. In the **Create New Zone** dialog, enter a meaningful name and description for your zone and select **Save**.

Repeat this procedure to create all of your zones across all of your sites.

## Assign your OT sensor to a site and zone

After you've connected your OT sensors to your on-premises management console, you'll see those sensors listed on the on-premises management console's **Site Management** page as **Unassigned sensors**.

For example:

:::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/unassigned-sensors.png" alt-text="Screenshot of unassigned sensors listed at the top of the Site Management page." lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/unassigned-sensors.png":::

If you've also configured sites and zones on your on-premises management, assign your sensors to a site and zone in order to [monitor detected data segmented separately](../monitor-zero-trust.md).

**To assign an OT sensor to a site and zone**:

1. Sign into your on-premises management console and select **Site Management**.

1. In the **Connectivity** column, verify that the sensor is currently connected to the on-premises management console.

1. Select **+ ASSIGN** for the sensor you want to assign to a zone. Then, in the **Assign Sensor** dialog, select the business unit, region, site, and zone where you want to assign the sensor.

1. Select **ASSIGN** to complete the assignment.

The page takes a few moments to refresh with the updated sensor assignments.

**To delete a sensor's zone assignment**:

1. Sign into your on-premises management console and select **Site Management**.

1. Locate the sensor who's sensor assignment you want to remove. At the far right of the sensor row, select the **Unassign** :::image type="icon" source="../media/how-to-activate-and-set-up-your-on-premises-management-console/unassign-sensor-icon.png" border="false"::: button.

1. In the confirmation message dialog, select **CONFIRM**.

The page takes a few moments to refresh with the updated sensor assignments.

## Manage sites and zones

As your network grows, you may need to have your OT sensors monitor different sites and zones. We recommend reviewing your network periodically and editing your sensors' site and zone assignments as needed.

After you've created sites and zones, you can view, edit, or delete them from both the **Enterprise View** and the **Site Management** pages on the on-premises management console.

- On the **Enterprise View** map, select a site to view all of its zones
- On the **Site Management** page, expand or collapse each site to its zones

For each site or zone, select the options menu to make changes, or to delete a site or zone. For example:

:::image type="content" source="../media/sites-and-zones/edit-delete-site-zone.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the options menu for editing or deleting a site or zone." lightbox="../media/sites-and-zones/edit-delete-site-zone.png":::
