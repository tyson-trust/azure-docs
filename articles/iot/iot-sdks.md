# Azure IoT SDKs

The following tables list the various SDKs you can use to build IoT solutions.

## Device SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-sdks-device](../../includes/iot-hub-sdks-device.md)]

Use the device SDKs to develop code to run on IoT devices that connect to IoT Hub or IoT Central.

To learn more about how to use the device SDKs, see [What is Azure IoT device and application development?](../iot-develop/about-iot-develop.md).

### Embedded device SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-sdks-embedded](../../includes/iot-hub-sdks-embedded.md)]

Use the embedded device SDKs to develop code to run on IoT devices that connect to IoT Hub or IoT Central.

To learn more about when to use the embedded device SDKs, see [C SDK and Embedded C SDK usage scenarios](../iot-develop/concepts-using-c-sdk-and-embedded-c-sdk.md).

## IoT Hub service SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-sdks-service](../../includes/iot-hub-sdks-service.md)]

To learn more about using the service SDKs to interact with devices through an IoT hub, see [IoT Plug and Play service developer guide](../iot-develop/concepts-developer-guide-service.md).

## IoT Hub management SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-sdks-management](../../includes/iot-hub-sdks-management.md)]

Alternatives to the management SDKs include the [Azure CLI](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-cli.md), [PowerShell](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-using-powershell.md), and [REST API](../iot-hub/iot-hub-rm-rest.md).

## DPS device SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-sdks-device](../../includes/iot-dps-sdks-device.md)]

### DPS embedded device SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-sdks-embedded](../../includes/iot-dps-sdks-embedded.md)]

## DPS service SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-sdks-service](../../includes/iot-dps-sdks-service.md)]

## DPS management SDKs

[!INCLUDE [iot-dps-sdks-management](../../includes/iot-dps-sdks-management.md)]

## Azure Digital Twins control plane APIs

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-sdks-control-plane](../../includes/digital-twins-sdks-control-plane.md)]

## Azure Digital Twins data plane APIs

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-sdks-data-plane](../../includes/digital-twins-sdks-data-plane.md)]
