## SAP HANA System Replication database backup support is now generally available

Azure Backup now supports backup of HANA database with HANA System Replication. Now, the log backups from the new primary node are accepted immediately; thus provides continuous database automatic protection,

This eliminates the need of manual intervention to continue backups on the new primary node during a failover. With the elimination of the need to trigger full backups for every failover, you can save costs and reduce time for continue protection.

For more information, see [Back up a HANA system with replication enabled](sap-hana-database-about.md#back-up-a-hana-system-with-replication-enabled).

## Cross Region Restore for PostgreSQL (preview)

Azure Backup allows you to replicate your backups to an additional Azure paired region by using Geo-redundant Storage (GRS) to protect your backups from regional outages. When you enable the backups with GRS, the backups in the secondary region become accessible only when Microsoft declares an outage in the primary region.

For more information, see [Cross Region Restore support for PostgreSQL using Azure Backup](backup-vault-overview.md#cross-region-restore-support-for-postgresql-using-azure-backup-preview).

## Microsoft Azure Backup Server v4 is now generally available

Azure Backup now provides Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS) v4, the latest edition of on-premises backup solution.

- It can *protect* and *run on* Windows Server 2022, Azure Stack HCI 22H2, vSphere 8.0, and SQL Server 2022.
- It contains stability improvements and bug fixes on *MABS v3 UR2*. 

For more information, see [What's new in MABS](backup-mabs-whats-new-mabs.md).
## Multiple backups per day for Azure VMs is now generally available

Azure Backup now enables you to create a backup policy to take multiple backups a day. With this capability, you can also define the duration in which your backup jobs would trigger and align your backup schedule with the working hours when there are frequent updates to Azure Virtual Machines.

For more information, see [Back up an Azure VM using Enhanced policy](backup-azure-vms-enhanced-policy.md).

## Immutable vault for Azure Backup is now generally available

Azure Backup now supports immutable vaults that help you ensure that recovery points once created can't be deleted before their expiry as per the backup policy (expiry at the time at which the recovery point was created). You can also choose to make the immutability irreversible to offer maximum protection to your backup data, thus helping you protect your data better against various threats, including ransomware attacks and malicious actors.

For more information, see the [concept of Immutable vault for Azure Backup](backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept.md).

## Support for selective disk backup with enhanced policy for Azure VM (preview)

Azure Backup now provides *Selective Disk backup and restore* capability to Enhanced policy. Using this capability, you can selectively back up a subset of the data disks that are attached to your VM, and then restore a subset of the disks that are available in a recovery point, both from instant restore and vault tier.

This is useful when you:

- Manage critical data in a subset of the VM disks.
- Use database backup solutions and want to back up only their OS disk to reduce cost. 

For more information, see [Selective disk backup and restore](selective-disk-backup-restore.md).

## Azure Kubernetes Service backup (preview)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) backup is a simple, cloud-native process to back up and restore the containerized applications and data running in AKS clusters. You can configure scheduled backup for both cluster state and application data (persistent volumes - CSI driver based Azure Disks). 

The solution provides granular control to choose a specific namespace or an entire cluster to back up or restore with the ability to store backups locally in a blob container and as disk snapshots. With AKS backup, you can unlock end-to-end scenarios - operational recovery, cloning test or developer environments, or cluster upgrade scenarios. 

AKS backup integrates with [Backup center](backup-center-overview.md) (with other backup management capabilities) to provide a single pane of glass that helps you govern, monitor, operate, and analyze backups at scale.

For more information, see [Overview of AKS backup (preview)](azure-kubernetes-service-backup-overview.md).

## Azure Blob vaulted backups (preview)

Azure Backup now enables you to perform a vaulted backup of block blob data in *general-purpose v2 storage accounts* to protect data against ransomware attacks or source data loss due to malicious or rogue admin. You can define the backup schedule to create recovery points and the retention settings that determine how long backups will be retained in the vault. You can configure and manage the vaulted and operational backups using a single backup policy. 

Under vaulted backups, the data is copied and stored in the Backup vault. So, you get an offsite copy of data that can be retained for up to *10 years*. If any data loss happens on the source account, you can trigger a restore to an alternate account and get access to your data. The vaulted backups can be managed at scale via the Backup center, and monitored via the rich alerting and reporting capabilities offered by the Azure Backup service.

If you're currently using operational backups, we recommend you to switch to vaulted backups for complete protection against different data loss scenarios.

For more information, see [Azure Blob backup overview](blob-backup-overview.md).

## Multi-user authorization using Resource Guard for Backup vault (in preview)

Azure Backup now supports multi-user authorization (MUA) that allows you to add an additional layer of protection to critical operations on your Backup vaults. For MUA, Azure Backup uses the Azure resource, Resource Guard, to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization.

For more information, see [MUA for Backup vault](multi-user-authorization-concept.md?tabs=backup-vault).

## Enhanced soft delete for Azure Backup (preview)

Enhanced soft delete provides improvements to the existing [soft delete](backup-azure-security-feature-cloud.md) feature. With enhanced soft delete, you can now make soft delete irreversible to prevent malicious actors from disabling it and deleting backups.

You can also customize soft delete retention period (for which soft deleted data must be retained). Enhanced soft delete is available for Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults.

For more information, see [Enhanced soft delete for Azure Backup](backup-azure-enhanced-soft-delete-about.md).

## Immutable vault for Azure Backup (in preview)

Azure Backup now supports immutable vaults that help you ensure that recovery points once created can't be deleted before their expiry as per the backup policy (expiry at the time at which the recovery point was created). You can also choose to make the immutability irreversible to offer maximum protection to your backup data, thus helping you protect your data better against various threats, including ransomware attacks and malicious actors.

For more information, see the [concept of Immutable vault for Azure Backup (preview)](backup-azure-immutable-vault-concept.md).

## SAP HANA instance snapshot backup support (preview)

Azure Backup now supports SAP HANA instance snapshot backup that provides a cost-effective backup solution using Managed disk incremental snapshots. Because instant backup uses snapshot, the effect on the database is minimum. 

You can now take an instant snapshot of the entire HANA instance and backup logs for all databases, with a single solution. It also enables you to instantly restore the entire instance with point-in-time recovery using logs over the snapshot.

For more information, see [Back up databases' instance snapshots (preview)](sap-hana-database-about.md#back-up-database-instance-snapshots-preview).

## SAP HANA System Replication database backup support (preview)

Azure Backup now supports backup of HANA database with HANA System Replication. Now, the log backups from the new primary node are accepted immediately; thus provides continuous database automatic protection,

This eliminates the need of manual intervention to continue backups on the new primary node during a failover. With the elimination of the need to trigger full backups for every failover, you can save costs and reduce time for continue protection.

For more information, see [Back up a HANA system with replication enabled (preview)](sap-hana-database-about.md#back-up-a-hana-system-with-replication-enabled).

## Built-in Azure Monitor alerting for Azure Backup is now generally available

Azure Backup now offers a new and improved alerting solution via Azure Monitor. This solution provides multiple benefits, such as:

- Ability to configure notifications to a wide range of notification channels.
- Ability to select specific scenarios to get notified.
- Ability to manage alerts and notifications programmatically.
- Ability to have a consistent alert management experience for multiple Azure services, including Azure Backup.

If you're currently using the [classic alerts solution](backup-azure-monitoring-built-in-monitor.md?tabs=recovery-services-vaults#backup-alerts-in-recovery-services-vault), we recommend you to switch to Azure Monitor alerts. Now, Azure Backup provides a guided experience via Backup center that allows you to switch to built-in Azure Monitor alerts and notifications with a few clicks.

For more information, see [Switch to Azure Monitor based alerts for Azure Backup](move-to-azure-monitor-alerts.md).

## Multi-user authorization using Resource Guard for Recovery Services vault is now generally available
 
Azure Backup now supports multi-user authorization (MUA) that allows you to add an additional layer of protection to critical operations on your Recovery Services vaults. For MUA, Azure Backup uses the Azure resource, Resource Guard, to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization.

For more information, see [how to protect Recovery Services vault and manage critical operations with MUA](multi-user-authorization.md).

## Archive tier support for Azure Virtual Machines is now generally available

Azure Backup now supports the movement of recovery points to the Vault-archive tier for Azure Virtual Machines from the Azure portal. This allows you to move the archivable/recommended recovery points (corresponding to a backup item) to the Vault-archive tier at one go.

Azure Backup also supports Vault-archive tier for SQL Server in Azure VM and SAP HANA in Azure VM. The support has been extended via Azure portal.
 
For more information, see [Archive tier support in Azure Backup](archive-tier-support.md).

## Multiple backups per day for Azure Files is now generally available

Low RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is a key requirement for Azure Files that contains the frequently updated, business-critical data. To ensure minimal data loss if a disaster or unwanted changes to file share content, you may prefer to take backups more frequently than once a day.

Using Azure Backup, you can create a backup policy or modify an existing backup policy to take multiple snapshots in a  day. This capability allows you to define the duration in which your backup jobs will run. Therefore, you can align your backup schedule with the working hours when there are frequent updates to Azure Files content. With this release, you can also configure policy for multiple backups per day using Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI.

For more information, see [how to configure multiple backups per day via backup policy](./manage-afs-backup.md#create-a-new-policy).

## Back up Azure Database for PostgreSQL is now generally available

Azure Backup and Azure Database services together help you to build an enterprise-class backup solution for Azure PostgreSQL (is now generally available). You can meet your data protection and compliance needs with a customer-controlled backup policy that enables retention of backups for up to 10 years.

With this, you've granular control to manage the backup and restore operations at the individual database level. Likewise, you can restore across PostgreSQL versions or to blob storage with ease. Besides using the Azure portal to perform the PostgreSQL database protection operations, you can also use the PowerShell, CLI, and REST API clients.

For more information, see [Azure Database for PostgreSQL backup](backup-azure-database-postgresql-overview.md).

## Archive Tier support for SQL Server/ SAP HANA in Azure VM from Azure portal

Azure Backup now supports the movement of recovery points to the Vault-archive tier for SQL Server and SAP HANA in Azure Virtual Machines from the Azure portal. This allows you to move the archivable recovery points corresponding to a particular database to the Vault-archive tier at one go.

Also, the support is extended via Azure CLI for the above workloads, along with Azure Virtual Machines (in preview).

For more information, see [Archive Tier support in Azure Backup](archive-tier-support.md).

## Multi-user authorization using Resource Guard for Recovery Services vault (in preview)

Azure Backup now supports multi-user authorization (MUA) that allows you to add an additional layer of protection to critical operations on your Recovery Services vaults. For MUA, Azure Backup uses the Azure resource, Resource Guard, to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization.

For more information, see [how to protect Recovery Services vault and manage critical operations with MUA](./multi-user-authorization.md).

## Multiple backups per day for Azure Files (in preview)

Low RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is a key requirement for Azure Files that contains the frequently updated, business-critical data. To ensure minimal data loss if a disaster or unwanted changes to file share content, you may prefer to take backups more frequently than once a day.

Using Azure Backup, you can now  create a backup policy or modify an existing backup policy to take multiple snapshots in a  day. With this capability, you can also define the duration in which your backup jobs would trigger. This capability empowers you to align your backup schedule with the working hours when there are frequent updates to Azure Files content.

For more information, see [how to configure multiple backups per day via backup policy](./manage-afs-backup.md#create-a-new-policy).

## Azure Backup metrics and metrics alerts (in preview)

Azure Backup now provides a set of built-in metrics via [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics.md) that allows you to monitor the health of your backups. You can also configure alert rules that trigger alerts when metrics exceed the defined thresholds.

Azure Backup offers the following key capabilities:
 
- Ability to view out-of-the-box metrics related to the backup and restore health of your backup items along with associated trends.
- Ability to write custom alert rules on these metrics to efficiently monitor the health of your backup items.
- Ability to route fired metric alerts to various notification channels that Azure Monitor supports, such as email, ITSM, webhook, logic apps, and so on.
 
Currently, Azure Backup supports built-in metrics for the following workload types:

- Azure VM
- SQL databases in Azure VM

In addition to the capability to move the recovery points:

- Azure Backup provides recommendations to move a specific set of recovery points for Azure Virtual Machine backups that will ensure cost savings.
- You have the capability to move all their recovery points for a particular backup item at one go using sample scripts.
- You can view Archive storage usage on the Vault dashboard.

For more information, see [Archive Tier support](./archive-tier-support.md).

## Backup for Azure Blobs is now generally available

Operational backup for Azure Blobs is a managed-data protection solution that lets you protect your block blob data from various data loss scenarios, such as blob corruptions, blob deletions, and accidental deletion of storage accounts.

Being an operational backup solution, the backup data is stored locally in the source storage account, and can be recovered from a selected point-in-time, giving you a simple and cost-effective means to protect your blob data. To do this, the solution uses the blob point-in-time restore capability available from blob storage.

Operational backup for blobs integrates with the Azure Backup management tools, including Backup Center, to help you manage the protection of your blob data effectively and at-scale. In addition to previously available capabilities, you can now configure and manage operational backup for blobs using the **Data protection** view of the storage accounts, also  [through PowerShell](backup-blobs-storage-account-ps.md). Also, Backup now gives you an enhanced experience for managing role assignments required for configuring operational backup.

For more information, see [Overview of operational backup for Azure Blobs](blob-backup-overview.md).

## Enhancements to encryption using customer-managed keys for Azure Backup (in preview)

Azure Backup now provides enhanced capabilities (in preview) to manage encryption with customer-managed keys. Azure Backup allows you to bring in your own keys to encrypt the backup data in the Recovery Services vaults, thus providing you with better control.

- Supports user-assigned managed identities to grant permissions to the keys to manage data encryption in the Recovery Services vault.
- Enables encryption with customer-managed keys while creating a Recovery Services vault.
