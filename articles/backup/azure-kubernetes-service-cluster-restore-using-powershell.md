# Restore Azure Kubernetes Service using PowerShell (preview) 

This article describes how to restore Azure Kubernetes cluster from a restore point created by Azure Backup using Azure PowerShell.

Azure Backup now allows you to back up AKS clusters (cluster resources and persistent volumes attached to the cluster) using a backup extension, which must be installed in the cluster. Backup vault communicates with the cluster via this Backup Extension to perform backup and restore operations. 

You can perform both *Original-Location Recovery (OLR)* (restoring in the AKS cluster that was backed up) and *Alternate-Location Recovery (ALR)* (restoring in a different AKS cluster). You can also select the items to be restored from the backup that is Item-Level Recovery (ILR).

>[!Note]
>Before you initiate a restore operation, the target cluster should have Backup Extension installed and Trusted Access enabled for the Backup vault. [Learn more](azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup-using-powershell.md#prepare-aks-cluster-for-backup).

Here, we've used an existing Backup vault *TestBkpVault*, under the resource group *testBkpVaultRG*, in the examples.

```azurepowershell
$TestBkpVault = Get-AzDataProtectionBackupVault -VaultName TestBkpVault -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG"
```

## Before you start

- AKS backup allows you to restore to original AKS cluster (that was backed up) and to an alternate AKS cluster. AKS backup allows you to perform a full restore and item-level restore. You can utilize [restore configurations](#restore-to-an-aks-cluster) to define parameters based on the cluster resources that will be picked up during the restore.

- You must [install the Backup Extension](azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-manage-backups.md#install-backup-extension) in the target AKS cluster. Also, you must [enable Trusted Access](azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-manage-backups.md#register-the-trusted-access) between the Backup vault and the AKS cluster.

For more information on the limitations and supported scenarios, see the [support matrix](azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-backup-support-matrix.md).

## Restore to an AKS cluster 

### Fetch the relevant recovery point

Fetch all instances using the `Get-AzDataProtectionBackupInstance` cmdlet and identify the relevant instance.

```azurepowershell
$AllInstances = Get-AzDataProtectionBackupInstance -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name
```

You can also use `Az.Resourcegraph` and `Search-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceInAzGraph` cmdlets to search across instances in multiple vaults and subscriptions.

```azurepowershell
$AllInstances = Search-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceInAzGraph -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name -DatasourceType AzureKubernetesService  -ProtectionStatus ProtectionConfigured
```

Once the instance is identified, fetch the relevant recovery point.

```azurepowershell
$rp = Get-AzDataProtectionRecoveryPoint -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -VaultName $TestBkpVault.Name -BackupInstanceName $AllInstances[2].BackupInstanceName
```

### Prepare the restore request

Get the Azure Resource Manager ID of the AKS cluster where you want to perform the restore operation.

```azurepowershell
$targetAKSClusterd = /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/resourceGroups/targetrg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/PSAKSCluster2
```

Use the `New-AzDataProtectionRestoreConfigurationClientObject` cmdlet to prepare the restore configuration and defining the items to be restored to the target AKS cluster.

```azurepowershell
$aksRestoreCriteria = New-AzDataProtectionRestoreConfigurationClientObject -DatasourceType AzureKubernetesService  -PersistentVolumeRestoreMode RestoreWithVolumeData  -IncludeClusterScopeResource $true -NamespaceMapping  @{"sourceNamespace"="targetNamespace"}
```

Then, use the `Initialize-AzDataProtectionRestoreRequest` cmdlet to prepare the restore request with all relevant details.

```azurepowershell
$aksRestoreRequest = Initialize-AzDataProtectionRestoreRequest -DatasourceType AzureKubernetesService  -SourceDataStore OperationalStore -RestoreLocation $dataSourceLocation -RestoreType OriginalLocation -RecoveryPoint $rps[0].Property.RecoveryPointId -RestoreConfiguration $aksRestoreCriteria -BackupInstance $backupInstance
```

## Trigger the restore

Before you trigger the restore operation, validate the restore request created earlier.

```azurepowershell
$validateRestore = Test-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceRestore -SubscriptionId $sub -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VaultName $vaultName -RestoreRequest $aksRestoreRequest -Name $backupInstance.BackupInstanceName
```

>[!Note]
>During the restore operation, the Backup vault and the AKS cluster need to have certain roles assigned to perform the restore:

1. *Target AKS* cluster should have *Contributor* role on the *Snapshot Resource Group*.
2. The *User Identity* attached with the Backup Extension should have *Storage Account Contributor* roles on the *storage account* where backups are stored. 
3. The *Backup vault* should have a *Reader* role on the *Target AKS cluster* and *Snapshot Resource Group*.

Now, use the `Start-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceRestore` cmdlet to trigger the restore operation with the request prepared above.

```azurepowershell
$restoreJob = Start-AzDataProtectionBackupInstanceRestore -SubscriptionId $sub -ResourceGroupName $rgName -VaultName $vaultName -BackupInstanceName $backupInstance.BackupInstanceName -Parameter $aksRestoreRequest
```

## Tracking job

Track all the jobs using the `Get-AzDataProtectionJob` cmdlet. You can list all jobs and fetch a particular job detail. You can also use `Az.ResourceGraph` to track all jobs across all Backup vaults.

Use the `Search-AzDataProtectionJobInAzGraph` cmdlet to get the relevant job, which can be across any Backup vault.

```azurepowershell
$job = Search-AzDataProtectionJobInAzGraph -Subscription $sub -ResourceGroupName "testBkpVaultRG" -Vault $TestBkpVault.Name -DatasourceType AzureDisk -Operation OnDemandBackup
```
