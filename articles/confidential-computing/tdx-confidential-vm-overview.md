# Preview of DCesv5 & ECesv5 confidential VMs 

Starting with the 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, Azure has begun supporting VMs backed by an all-new hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment called [Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html#inpage-nav-2). Organizations can use these VMs to seamlessly bring confidential workloads to the cloud without any code changes to their applications.

Intel TDX helps harden the virtualized environment to deny the hypervisor and other host management code access to VM memory and state, including the cloud operator. Intel TDX helps assure workload integrity and confidentiality by mitigating a wide range of software and hardware attacks, including intrusion or inspection by software running in other VMs.
