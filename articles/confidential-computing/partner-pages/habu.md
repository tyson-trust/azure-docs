# Habu


## Overview

Data clean rooms allow organizations to share data and collaborate on analytics without compromising privacy and security. Habu is a pioneer in data clean rooms, offering a fully interoperable cloud solution that allows multiple organizations to collaborate without moving data. They now provide clean rooms that support [Azure confidential computing](../overview.md) on [AMD powered confidential VMs](../confidential-vm-overview.md) to increase data privacy protection.

Collaboration partners can now participate in cross-cloud, cross-region data sharing - with protections against unauthorized access to data across partners, cloud providers, and even Habu. You can hear more from Habuâ€™s Chief Product Officer, Matthew Karasick, on their [partnership with Azure here](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/4cdcea58-d6fa-43f9-a1ea-27a8983e3f57?source=partnerdetail).

You can also get started on their [Azure Marketplace solution](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/habuinc1663874067667.habu?tab=Overview), today.
