# Opaque Systems, Inc.


## Overview

Opaque makes confidential data useful by enabling secure analytics and machine learning on encrypted data. With Opaque Systems, you can analyze encrypted data in the cloud using popular tools like Apache Spark, while ensuring that your data is never exposed unencrypted to anybody else — not the cloud provider, not system administrators with root access, not even to Opaque! Analyze encrypted, structured data securely using Spark SQL. Run arbitrary SQL queries, complex analytics, and ETL pipelines on encrypted data loaded from multiple sources.

You can learn more about Opaque in [our partner webinar here](https://vshow.on24.com/vshow/Azure_Confidential/exhibits/Opaque).

## Opaque analytics

By combining encrypted data from several sources and training models on the joint dataset, you can generate insights that would otherwise be impossible. This product enables secure collaboration with partners, data providers, data processors, different business units, and 3rd parties. The data remains encrypted from your storage system all the way to the cloud platform’s CPU run-time memory.
