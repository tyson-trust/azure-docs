## Terms of Use

Your use of the Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access preview experiences and features is governed by the preview online service terms and conditions of the agreement(s) under which you obtained the services.  

Previews are provided “as-is,” “with all faults,” and “as available,” and are excluded from the service level agreements and limited warranty. Previews may not be covered by customer support. We may change or discontinue previews at any time without notice. We intend on adding additional capabilities incrementally. We recommend piloting these features with a subset of users.

Previews may be subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments, as further explained in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839), [Microsoft Trust Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2179910), the [Product Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2173816), the [Microsoft Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2153219), and any other notices provided with the Preview.
