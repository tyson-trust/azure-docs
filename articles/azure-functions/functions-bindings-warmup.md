# Azure Functions warmup trigger

This article explains how to work with the warmup trigger in Azure Functions. A warmup trigger is invoked when an instance is added to scale a running function app. The warmup trigger lets you define a function that's run when a new instance of your function app is started. You can use a warmup trigger to pre-load custom dependencies during the pre-warming process so your functions are ready to start processing requests immediately. Some actions for a warmup trigger might include opening connections, loading dependencies, or running any other custom logic before your app begins receiving traffic.

The following considerations apply when using a warmup trigger:

* The warmup trigger isn't available to apps running on the [Consumption plan](./consumption-plan.md).
* The warmup trigger isn't supported on version 1.x of the Functions runtime.  
* Support for the warmup trigger is provided by default in all development environments. You don't have to manually install the package or register the extension.
* There can be only one warmup trigger function per function app, and it can't be invoked after the instance is already running.
* The warmup trigger is only called during scale-out operations, not during restarts or other non-scale startups. Make sure your logic can load all required dependencies without relying on the warmup trigger. Lazy loading is a good pattern to achieve this goal.
* Dependencies created by warmup trigger should be shared with other functions in your app. To learn more, see [Static clients](manage-connections.md#static-clients).
* If the [built-in authentication](../app-service/overview-authentication-authorization.md) (aka Easy Auth) is used, [HTTPS Only](../app-service/configure-ssl-bindings.md#enforce-https) should be enabled for the warmup trigger to get invoked.

{

    //Declare shared dependencies here

    public static class Warmup
    {
        [FunctionName("Warmup")]
        public static void Run([WarmupTrigger()] WarmupContext context,
            ILogger log)
        {
            //Initialize shared dependencies here
            
            log.LogInformation("Function App instance is warm ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž");
        }
    }

# [C# Script](#tab/csharp-script)

The following example shows a warmup trigger in a *function.json* file and a [C# script function](functions-reference-csharp.md) that runs on each new instance when it's added to your app.

Here's the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "warmupTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "warmupContext"
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information, see [Attributes](#attributes).

```cs
public static void Run(WarmupContext warmupContext, ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("Function App instance is warm ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž");  
}
```

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"

The following example shows a warmup trigger that runs when each new instance is added to your app.

```java
@FunctionName("Warmup")
public void warmup( @WarmupTrigger Object warmupContext, ExecutionContext context) {
    context.getLogger().info("Function App instance is warm ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž");
}
```

::: zone pivot="programming-language-javascript"  

The following example shows a warmup trigger in a *function.json* file and a [JavaScript function](functions-reference-node.md) that runs on each new instance when it's added to your app.

Here's the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "warmupTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "warmupContext"
        }
    ]
}
```

The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

Here's the JavaScript code:

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, warmupContext) {
    context.log('Function App instance is warm ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž');
};
```

Here's the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "warmupTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "warmupContext"
        }
    ]
}

::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"  

The following example shows a warmup trigger in a *function.json* file and a [Python function](functions-reference-python.md) that runs on each new instance when it'is added to your app.

Your function must be named `warmup` (case-insensitive) and there may only be one warmup function per app.

Here's the *function.json* file:

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "type": "warmupTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "name": "warmupContext"
        }
    ]
}
```

For more information, see [Configuration](#configuration).

Here's the Python code:

```python
import logging
import azure.functions as func


def main(warmupContext: func.Context) -> None:
    logging.info('Function App instance is warm ðŸŒžðŸŒžðŸŒž')
```

## Attributes

Both [in-process](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) and [isolated worker process](dotnet-isolated-process-guide.md) C# libraries use the `WarmupTrigger` attribute to define the function. C# script instead uses a *function.json* configuration file.

# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

Use the `WarmupTrigger` attribute to define the function. This attribute has no parameters.   

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

Use the `WarmupTrigger` attribute to define the function. This attribute has no parameters.

# [C# script](#tab/csharp-script)

C# script uses a function.json file for configuration instead of attributes.

The following table explains the binding configuration properties for C# script that you set in the *function.json* file. 

|function.json property |Description |
|---------|----------------------|
| **type** | Required - must be set to `warmupTrigger`. |
| **direction** | Required - must be set to `in`. |
| **name** | Required - the name of the binding parameter, which is usually `warmupContext`. |

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"  
## Annotations

Annotations aren't required by a warmup trigger. Just use a name of `warmup` (case-insensitive) for the `FunctionName` annotation.

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the *function.json* file. 

|function.json property |Description|
|---------|----------------------|
| **type** | Required - must be set to `warmupTrigger`. |
| **direction** | Required - must be set to `in`. |
| **name** | Required - the variable name used in function code. A `name` of `warmupContext` is recommended for the binding parameter.|

## Usage

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"  
The following considerations apply to using a warmup function in C#:

# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

- Your function must be named `warmup` (case-insensitive) using the `FunctionName` attribute.
- A return value attribute isn't required.
- You must be using version `3.0.5` of the `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions` package, or a later version. 
- You can pass a `WarmupContext` instance to the function.

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

- Your function must be named `warmup` (case-insensitive) using the `Function` attribute.
- A return value attribute isn't required.
- You can pass an object instance to the function.

# [C# script](#tab/csharp-script)

Not supported for version 1.x of the Functions runtime.
