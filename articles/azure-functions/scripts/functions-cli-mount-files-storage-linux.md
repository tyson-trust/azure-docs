# Mount a file share to a Python function app using Azure CLI

This Azure Functions sample script creates a function app using the [Consumption plan](../consumption-plan.md) and creates a share in Azure Files. It then mounts the share so that the data can be accessed by your functions.  

>[!NOTE]
>The function app created runs on Python version 3.9. Azure Functions also [supports Python versions 3.7 and 3.8](../functions-reference-python.md#python-version).

| [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#az-functionapp-create) | Creates a function app. |
| [az storage share create](/cli/azure/storage/share#az-storage-share-create) | Creates an Azure Files share in storage account. | 
| [az storage directory create](/cli/azure/storage/directory#az-storage-directory-create) | Creates a directory in the share. |
| [az webapp config storage-account add](/cli/azure/webapp/config/storage-account#az-webapp-config-storage-account-add) | Mounts the share to the function app. |
