# Azure SQL trigger for Functions (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure SQL trigger for Functions is currently in preview and requires that a preview extension library or extension bundle is used. In consumption plan functions, automatic scaling is not available for SQL trigger. Use premium or dedicated plans for [scaling benefits](functions-scale.md) with SQL trigger.

The Azure SQL trigger uses [SQL change tracking](/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-tracking-sql-server) functionality to monitor a SQL table for changes and trigger a function when a row is created, updated, or deleted. For configuration details for change tracking for use with the Azure SQL trigger, see [Set up change tracking](#set-up-change-tracking-required). For information on setup details of the Azure SQL extension for Azure Functions, see the [SQL binding overview](./functions-bindings-azure-sql.md).

The Azure SQL trigger scaling decisions for the Consumption and Premium plans are done via target-based scaling. For more information, see [Target-based scaling](functions-target-based-scaling.md).

## Functionality Overview

The Azure SQL trigger binding uses a polling loop to check for changes, triggering the user function when changes are detected. At a high level, the loop looks like this:

```
while (true) {
    1. Get list of changes on table - up to a maximum number controlled by the Sql_Trigger_MaxBatchSize setting
    2. Trigger function with list of changes
    3. Wait for delay controlled by Sql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs setting
}
```

Changes are processed in the order that their changes were made, with the oldest changes being processed first. A couple notes about change processing:

1. If changes to multiple rows are made at once the exact order that they are sent to the function is based on the order returned by the CHANGETABLE function
2. Changes are "batched" together for a row. If multiple changes are made to a row between each iteration of the loop then only a single change entry exists for that row which will show the difference between the last processed state and the current state
3. If changes are made to a set of rows, and then another set of changes are made to half of those same rows, then the half of the rows that weren't changed a second time are processed first. This processing logic is due to the above note with the changes being batched - the trigger will only see the "last" change made and use that for the order it processes them in

For more information on change tracking and how it's used by applications such as Azure SQL triggers, see [work with change tracking](/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/work-with-change-tracking-sql-server) .

## Example usage
<a id="example"></a>


# [In-process](#tab/in-process)

More samples for the Azure SQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/tree/release/trigger/samples/samples-csharp).


The example refers to a `ToDoItem` class and a corresponding database table:

:::code language="csharp" source="~/functions-sql-todo-sample/ToDoModel.cs" range="6-16":::

:::code language="sql" source="~/functions-sql-todo-sample/sql/create.sql" range="1-7":::

[Change tracking](#set-up-change-tracking-required) is enabled on the database and on the table:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [SampleDatabase]
SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON
(CHANGE_RETENTION = 2 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[ToDo]
ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING;
```

The SQL trigger binds to a `IReadOnlyList<SqlChange<T>>`, a list of `SqlChange` objects each with two properties:
- **Item:** the item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema as seen in the `ToDoItem` class.
- **Operation:** a value from `SqlChangeOperation` enum. The possible values are `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete`.

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) that is invoked when there are changes to the `ToDo` table:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Sql;

namespace AzureSQL.ToDo
{
    public static class ToDoTrigger
    {
        [FunctionName("ToDoTrigger")]
        public static void Run(
            [SqlTrigger("[dbo].[ToDo]", "SqlConnectionString")]
            IReadOnlyList<SqlChange<ToDoItem>> changes,
            ILogger logger)
        {
            foreach (SqlChange<ToDoItem> change in changes)
            {
                ToDoItem toDoItem = change.Item;
                logger.LogInformation($"Change operation: {change.Operation}");
                logger.LogInformation($"Id: {toDoItem.Id}, Title: {toDoItem.title}, Url: {toDoItem.url}, Completed: {toDoItem.completed}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# [Isolated process](#tab/isolated-process)

More samples for the Azure SQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/tree/release/trigger/samples/samples-outofproc).


The example refers to a `ToDoItem` class and a corresponding database table:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [SampleDatabase]
SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON
(CHANGE_RETENTION = 2 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[ToDo]
ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING;
```

The SQL trigger binds to a `IReadOnlyList<SqlChange<T>>`, a list of `SqlChange` objects each with two properties:
- **Item:** the item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema as seen in the `ToDoItem` class.
- **Operation:** a value from `SqlChangeOperation` enum. The possible values are `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete`.

The following example shows a [C# function](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) that is invoked when there are changes to the `ToDo` table:

        {
            var logger = context.GetLogger("ToDoTrigger");
            foreach (SqlChange<ToDoItem> change in changes)
            {
                ToDoItem toDoItem = change.Item;

            }
        }
    }
}
```

using System.Net;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public static void Run(IReadOnlyList<SqlChange<ToDoItem>> todoChanges, ILogger log)

## Example usage
<a id="example"></a>

More samples for the Azure SQL trigger are available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/tree/release/trigger/samples/samples-java).


The example refers to a `ToDoItem` class, a `SqlChangeToDoItem` class, a `SqlChangeOperation` enum, and a corresponding database table:

In a separate file `ToDoItem.java`:

```java
package com.function;
import java.util.UUID;

public class ToDoItem {
    public UUID Id;
    public int order;
    public String title;
    public String url;
    public boolean completed;

    public ToDoItem() {
    }

    public ToDoItem(UUID Id, int order, String title, String url, boolean completed) {
        this.Id = Id;
        this.order = order;
        this.title = title;
        this.url = url;
        this.completed = completed;
    }
}
```

In a separate file `SqlChangeToDoItem.java`:
```java
package com.function;

public class SqlChangeToDoItem {
    public ToDoItem item;
    public SqlChangeOperation operation;

    public SqlChangeToDoItem() {
    }

    public SqlChangeToDoItem(ToDoItem item, SqlChangeOperation operation) {
        this.item = item;
        this.operation = operation;
    }
}
```

In a separate file `SqlChangeOperation.java`:
```java
package com.function;

import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName;

public enum SqlChangeOperation {
    @SerializedName("0")
    Insert,
    @SerializedName("1")
    Update,
    @SerializedName("2")
    Delete;
}
```

:::code language="sql" source="~/functions-sql-todo-sample/sql/create.sql" range="1-7":::

[Change tracking](#set-up-change-tracking-required) is enabled on the database and on the table:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE [SampleDatabase]
SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON
(CHANGE_RETENTION = 2 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON);

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[ToDo]
ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING;
```

The SQL trigger binds to a `SqlChangeToDoItem[]`, an array of `SqlChangeToDoItem` objects each with two properties:
- **item:** the item that was changed. The type of the item should follow the table schema as seen in the `ToDoItem` class.
- **operation:** a value from `SqlChangeOperation` enum. The possible values are `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete`.


The following example shows a Java function that is invoked when there are changes to the `ToDo` table:

```java
package com.function;

import com.microsoft.azure.functions.ExecutionContext;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.annotation.FunctionName;
import com.microsoft.azure.functions.sql.annotation.SQLTrigger;
import com.function.Common.SqlChangeToDoItem;
import com.google.gson.Gson;

import java.util.logging.Level;

public class ProductsTrigger {
    @FunctionName("ToDoTrigger")

}
```


The [configuration](#configuration) section explains these properties.

The following is sample PowerShell code for the function in the `run.ps1` file:

```powershell
using namespace System.Net

param($todoChanges)
# The output is used to inspect the trigger binding parameter in test methods.
# Use -Compress to remove new lines and spaces for testing purposes.
$changesJson = $todoChanges | ConvertTo-Json -Compress

## Attributes

The [C# library](functions-dotnet-class-library.md) uses the [SqlTrigger](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/release/trigger/src/TriggerBinding/SqlTriggerAttribute.cs) attribute to declare the SQL trigger on the function, which has the following properties:

| Attribute property |Description|
|---------|---------|
| **TableName** | Required. The name of the table monitored by the trigger.  |
| **ConnectionStringSetting** | Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database containing the table monitored for changes. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting (in `local.settings.json` for local development) that contains the [connection string](/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-5.&preserve-view=true#Microsoft_Data_SqlClient_SqlConnection_ConnectionString) to the Azure SQL or SQL Server instance.|
| **LeasesTableName** | Optional. Name of the table used to store leases. If not specified, the leases table name will be Leases_{FunctionId}_{TableId}. More information on how this is generated can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/release/trigger/docs/TriggerBinding.md#az_funcleasestablename).

::: zone pivot="programming-language-java"  
## Annotations

In the [Java functions runtime library](/java/api/overview/azure/functions/runtime), use the `@SQLTrigger` annotation (`com.microsoft.azure.functions.sql.annotation.SQLTrigger`) on parameters whose value would come from Azure SQL. This annotation supports the following elements:

| Element |Description|
|---------|---------|
| **name** | Required. The name of the parameter that the trigger binds to. |
| **tableName** | Required. The name of the table monitored by the trigger.  |
| **connectionStringSetting** | Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database containing the table monitored for changes. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting (in `local.settings.json` for local development) that contains the [connection string](/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-5.&preserve-view=true#Microsoft_Data_SqlClient_SqlConnection_ConnectionString) to the Azure SQL or SQL Server instance.|
| **LeasesTableName** | Optional. Name of the table used to store leases. If not specified, the leases table name will be Leases_{FunctionId}_{TableId}. More information on how this is generated can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/release/trigger/docs/TriggerBinding.md#az_funcleasestablename).

## Configuration

The following table explains the binding configuration properties that you set in the function.json file.

|function.json property | Description|
|---------|----------------------|
| **name** | Required. The name of the parameter that the trigger binds to. |
| **type** | Required. Must be set to `sqlTrigger`. |
| **direction** | Required. Must be set to `in`. |
| **tableName** | Required. The name of the table monitored by the trigger.  |
| **connectionStringSetting** | Required. The name of an app setting that contains the connection string for the database containing the table monitored for changes. The connection string setting name corresponds to the application setting (in `local.settings.json` for local development) that contains the [connection string](/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-5.&preserve-view=true#Microsoft_Data_SqlClient_SqlConnection_ConnectionString) to the Azure SQL or SQL Server instance.|
| **LeasesTableName** | Optional. Name of the table used to store leases. If not specified, the leases table name will be Leases_{FunctionId}_{TableId}.

## Optional Configuration

In addition to the required ConnectionStringSetting [application setting](./functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md#settings), the following optional settings can be configured for the SQL trigger:

| App Setting | Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Sql_Trigger_BatchSize** |The maximum number of changes processed with each iteration of the trigger loop before being sent to the triggered function. The default value is 100.|
|**Sql_Trigger_PollingIntervalMs**|The delay in milliseconds between processing each batch of changes. The default value is 1000 (1 second).|
|**Sql_Trigger_MaxChangesPerWorker**|The upper limit on the number of pending changes in the user table that are allowed per application-worker. If the count of changes exceeds this limit, it may result in a scale-out. The setting only applies for Azure Function Apps with [runtime driven scaling enabled](#enable-runtime-driven-scaling). The default value is 1000.|


[!INCLUDE [app settings to local.settings.json](../../includes/functions-app-settings-local.md)]

## Set up change tracking (required)

Setting up change tracking for use with the Azure SQL trigger requires two steps.  These steps can be completed from any SQL tool that supports running queries, including [Visual Studio Code](/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/mssql-extensions), [Azure Data Studio](/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) or [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

1. Enable change tracking on the SQL database, substituting `your database name` with the name of the database where the table to be monitored is located:

    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE [your database name]
    SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON
    (CHANGE_RETENTION = 2 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON);
    ```

    The `CHANGE_RETENTION` option specifies the time period for which change tracking information (change history) is kept.  The retention of change history by the SQL database may affect the trigger functionality. For example, if the Azure Function is turned off for several days and then resumed, the database will contain the changes that occurred in past two days in the above setup example.

    The `AUTO_CLEANUP` option is used to enable or disable the clean-up task that removes old change tracking information. If a temporary problem that prevents the trigger from running, turning off auto cleanup can be useful to pause the removal of information older than the retention period until the problem is resolved.

    More information on change tracking options is available in the [SQL documentation](/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-tracking-sql-server).

2. Enable change tracking on the table, substituting `your table name` with the name of the table to be monitored (changing the schema if appropriate):

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [dbo].[your table name]
    ENABLE CHANGE_TRACKING;
    ```

    The trigger needs to have read access on the table being monitored for changes and to the change tracking system tables. Each function trigger has an associated change tracking table and leases table in a schema `az_func`. These tables are created by the trigger if they don't yet exist.  More information on these data structures is available in the Azure SQL binding library [documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/main/docs/BindingsOverview.md#internal-state-tables).


## Enable runtime-driven scaling

Optionally, your functions can scale automatically based on the number of changes that are pending to be processed in the user table. To allow your functions to scale properly on the Premium plan when using SQL triggers, you need to enable runtime scale monitoring.

[!INCLUDE [functions-runtime-scaling](../../includes/functions-runtime-scaling.md)]

## Retry support

Further information on the SQL trigger [retry support](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/release/trigger/docs/BindingsOverview.md#retry-support-for-trigger-bindings) and [leases tables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/release/trigger/docs/TriggerBinding.md#internal-state-tables) is available in the GitHub repository.

### Startup retries
If an exception occurs during startup then the host runtime automatically attempts to restart the trigger listener with an exponential backoff strategy. These retries continue until either the listener is successfully started or the startup is canceled.

### Broken connection retries
If the function successfully starts but then an error causes the connection to break (such as the server going offline) then the function continues to try and reopen the connection until the function is either stopped or the connection succeeds. If the connection is successfully re-established then it picks up processing changes where it left off.

Note that these retries are outside the built-in idle connection retry logic that SqlClient has which can be configured with the `ConnectRetryCount` and `ConnectRetryInterval` [connection string options](/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-5.0&preserve-view=true#Microsoft_Data_SqlClient_SqlConnection_ConnectionString). The built-in idle connection retries are attempted first and if those fail to reconnect then the trigger binding attempts to re-establish the connection itself.

### Function exception retries
If an exception occurs in the user function when processing changes then the batch of rows currently being processed are retried again in 60 seconds. Other changes are processed as normal during this time, but the rows in the batch that caused the exception are ignored until the timeout period has elapsed.

If the function execution fails five times in a row for a given row then that row is completely ignored for all future changes. Because the rows in a batch are not deterministic, rows in a failed batch may end up in different batches in subsequent invocations. This means that not all rows in the failed batch will necessarily be ignored. If other rows in the batch were the ones causing the exception, the "good" rows may end up in a different batch that doesn't fail in future invocations.
