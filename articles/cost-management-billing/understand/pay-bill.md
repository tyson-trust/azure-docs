# Pay your Microsoft Customer Agreement Azure or Microsoft Online Subscription Program Azure bill

This article applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) and to customers who signed up for Azure through the Azure website, Azure.com (for a Microsoft Online Services Program (MOSP) account also called pay-as-you-go account).

[Check your access to a Microsoft Customer Agreement](#check-access-to-a-microsoft-customer-agreement).

There are two ways to pay for your bill for Azure. You can pay with the default payment method of your billing profile or you can make a one-time payment with **Pay now**.

If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method will always be set to *wire transfer*. Automatic credit card payment isn't an option if you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative. Instead, you can [pay with a credit card for individual invoices](#pay-now-in-the-azure-portal).

[!INCLUDE [Pay by check](../../../includes/cost-management-pay-check.md)]

If you have a Microsoft Online Services Program account, your default payment method is credit card. Payments are normally automatically deducted from your credit card, but you can also make one-time payments manually by credit card.

If you have Azure credits, they automatically apply to your invoice each billing period.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of the payment method selected to complete your payment, you must specify the invoice number in the payment details.

Here's a table summarizing payment methods for different agreement types

|Agreement type| Credit card | Wire transfer¹ |
| --- | ---- | --- | 
| Microsoft Customer Agreement<br>purchased through a Microsoft representative | ✔ (with a $50,000.00 USD limit) | ✔ |
| Enterprise Agreement | ✘ | ✔ |
| MOSP | ✔ | ✔ if approved to pay by invoice |

¹ If supported by your bank, an ACH credit transaction can be made automatically.

## Reserve Bank of India 

**The Reserve Bank of India has issued new directives.**

On 1 October 2021, automatic payments in India may block some credit card transactions, especially transactions exceeding 5,000 INR. Because of this situation, you may need to make payments manually in the Azure portal. This directive won't affect the total amount you'll be charged for your Azure usage.

On 8 June 2022, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the limit of e-mandates on cards for recurring payments from INR 5,000 to INR 15,000.

[Learn more about the Reserve Bank of India directive; Processing of e-mandate on cards for recurring transactions](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11668&Mode=0)

On 30 September 2022, Microsoft and other online merchants will no longer be storing credit card information. To comply with this regulation Microsoft will be removing all stored card details from Microsoft Azure. To avoid service interruption, you'll need to add and verify your payment method to make a payment in the Azure portal for all invoices.

### UPI and NetBanking payment options

Azure supports two alternate payment options for customers in India:

- UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payment is a real-time payment method.
- NetBanking (Internet Banking) facilitates customers with access to banking services on an online platform.

#### How do I make a payment with UPI or NetBanking?

UPI and NetBanking are only supported for one-time transactions.

To make a payment with UPI or NetBanking:

1. Select Add a new payment method when you’re making a payment.
2. Select UPI / NetBanking.
3. You're redirected to a payment partner, like Billdesk, where you can choose your payment method.
4. You’re redirected to your bank's website where you can process the payment.

After you submit the payment, allow time for the payment to appear in the Azure portal.

#### How am I refunded if I made a payment with UPI or NetBanking?

Refunds are treated as a regular charge. They’re refunded to your bank account.

## Pay by default payment method

The default payment method of your billing profile can either be a credit card, debit card, or wire transfer.

### Credit or debit card

If the default payment method for your billing profile is a credit or debit card, it's automatically charged each billing period.

If your automatic credit or debit card charge gets declined for any reason, you can make a one-time payment with a credit or debit card in the Azure portal using **Pay now**.

If you have a Microsoft Online Services Program (pay-as-you-go) account and you have a bill due, you'll see the **Pay now** banner on your subscription property page. 

If you want to learn how to change your default payment method to wire transfer, see [How to pay by invoice](../manage/pay-by-invoice.md).

There are a few countries/regions that don't allow the use of debit cards, however in general, you can use them to pay your Azure bill. Virtual and prepaid debit cards can't be used to pay your Azure bill. 

- Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Brazil only support credit cards.
- India supports debit and credit cards through Visa and Mastercard.

### Wire transfer

If the default payment method of your billing profile is wire transfer, follow the payment instructions shown on your invoice PDF file.

Alternatively, if your invoice is under the threshold amount for your currency, you can make a one-time payment in the Azure portal with a credit or debit card using **Pay now**. If your invoice amount exceeds the threshold, you can't pay your invoice with a credit or debit card. You'll find the threshold amount for your currency in the Azure portal after selecting **Pay now**.

> [!NOTE]
> When multiple invoices are remitted in a single wire transfer, you must specify the invoice numbers for all of the invoices.

#### Bank details used to send wire transfer payments

## Pay now in the Azure portal

To pay invoices in the Azure portal, you must have the correct [MCA permissions](../manage/understand-mca-roles.md) or be the Billing Account admin. The Billing Account admin is the user who originally signed up for the MCA account.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search on **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu, select **Invoices** under **Billing**.
1. If any of your eligible invoices are due or past due, you'll see a blue **Pay now** link for that invoice. Select **Pay now**.
1. In the Pay now window, select or tap **Select a payment method** to choose an existing credit card or add a new one.
1. After you select a payment method, select **Pay now**.

The invoice status shows *paid* within 24 hours.

## Pay now might be unavailable

If you have a Microsoft Online Services Program account (pay-as-you-go account), the **Pay now** option might be unavailable. Instead, you might see a **Settle balance** banner. If so, see [Resolve past due balance](../manage/resolve-past-due-balance.md#resolve-past-due-balance-in-the-azure-portal).

Based on the default payment method and invoice amount, the **Pay now** option might be unavailable. Check your invoice for payment instructions.
