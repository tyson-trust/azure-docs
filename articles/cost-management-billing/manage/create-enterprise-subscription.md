# Create an Enterprise Agreement subscription

This article helps you create an [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/) subscription for yourself or for someone else in your current Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directory/tenant. You may want another subscription to avoid hitting subscription quota limits, to create separate environments for security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.

If you want to create subscriptions for Microsoft Customer Agreements, see [Create a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription](create-subscription.md). If you're a Microsoft Partner and you want to create a subscription for a customer, see [Create a subscription for a partner's customer](create-customer-subscription.md). Or, if you have a Microsoft Online Service Program (MOSP) billing account, also called pay-as-you-go, you can create subscriptions starting in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) and then you complete the process at https://signup.azure.com/.
