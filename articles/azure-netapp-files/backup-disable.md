# Disable backup functionality for a volume 

You can disable the backup functionality for a volume if you no longer need the backup protection. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disabling backups for a volume will delete all the backups stored in the Azure storage for that volume.

If a volume is deleted but the backup policy wasnâ€™t disabled before the volume deletion, all the backups related to the volume are retained in the Azure storage and will be listed under the associated NetApp account. 

## Steps

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Existing backups not assigned to a backup vault must be migrated. You cannot perform any operations on a backup until it has been migrated to a backup vault. To learn how to migrate, see [Manage backup vaults](backup-vault-manage.md#migrate-backups-to-a-backup-vault).

1. Select **Volumes**.
2. Select the specific volume whose backup functionality you want to disable.
3. Select **Configure**.
4. In the Configure Backups page, toggle the **Enabled** setting to **Off**. Enter the volume name to confirm, and click **OK**.
