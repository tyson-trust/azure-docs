## Determine if a directory is approaching the limit size <a name="directory-limit"></a>  

You can use the `stat` command from a client to see whether a directory is approaching the maximum size limit for directory metadata (320 MB). If you reach the maximum size limit for a single directory for Azure NetApp Files, the error `No space left on device` occurs.   

For a 320-MB directory, the number of blocks is 655360, with each block size being 512 bytes.  (That is, 320x1024x1024/512.)  This number translates to approximately 4 million files maximum for a 320-MB directory. However, the actual number of maximum files might be lower, depending on factors such as the number of files with non-ASCII characters in the directory. As such, you should use the `stat` command as follows to determine whether your directory is approaching its limit.  

Examples:

```console
[makam@cycrh6rtp07 ~]$ stat bin
File: 'bin'
Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 65536  directory

[makam@cycrh6rtp07 ~]$ stat tmp
File: 'tmp'
Size: 12288           Blocks: 24         IO Block: 65536  directory
 
[makam@cycrh6rtp07 ~]$ stat tmp1
File: 'tmp1'
Size: 4096            Blocks: 8          IO Block: 65536  directory
```

## `Maxfiles` limits <a name="maxfiles"></a> 

Azure NetApp Files volumes have a limit called *`maxfiles`*. The `maxfiles` limit is the number of files a volume can contain. Linux file systems refer to the limit as *inodes*. The `maxfiles` limit for an Azure NetApp Files volume is indexed based on the size (quota) of the volume. The `maxfiles` limit for a volume increases or decreases at the rate of 21,251,126 files per TiB of provisioned volume size. 

The service dynamically adjusts the `maxfiles` limit for a volume based on its provisioned size. For example, a volume configured initially with a size of 1 TiB would have a `maxfiles` limit of 21,251,126. Subsequent changes to the size of the volume would result in an automatic readjustment of the `maxfiles` limit based on the following rules: 

**For volumes up to 100 TiB in size:**

|    Volume size (quota)     |  Automatic readjustment of the `maxfiles` limit    |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
|    <= 1 TiB                |    21,251,126     |
|    > 1 TiB but <= 2 TiB    |    42,502,252     |
|    > 2 TiB but <= 3 TiB    |    63,753,378     |
|    > 3 TiB but <= 4 TiB    |    85,004,504     |
|    > 4 TiB but <= 100 TiB  |    106,255,630    |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If your volume has a volume size (quota) of more than 4 TiB and you want to increase the `maxfiles` limit, you must initiate [a support request](#request-limit-increase).

For volumes 100 TiB or under, if you've allocated at least 5 TiB of quota for a volume, you can initiate a support request to increase the `maxfiles` (inodes) limit beyond 106,255,630. For every 106,255,630 files you increase (or a fraction thereof), you need to increase the corresponding volume quota by 5 TiB. For example, if you increase the `maxfiles` limit from 106,255,630 files to 212,511,260 files (or any number in between), you need to increase the volume quota from 5 TiB to 10 TiB. 

For volumes 100 TiB or under, you can increase the `maxfiles` limit up to 531,278,150 if your volume quota is at least 25 TiB.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Once a volume has exceeded a `maxfiles` limit, you cannot reduce volume size below the quota corresponding to that `maxfiles` limit even if you have reduced the actual used file count. For example, if you have crossed the 63,753,378 `maxfiles` limit, the volume quota cannot be reduced below its corresponding index of 2 TiB.

**For [large volumes](azure-netapp-files-understand-storage-hierarchy.md#large-volumes):**

| Volume size (quota) | Automatic readjustment of the `maxfiles` limit |
| - | - |
|   > 100 TiB    | 2,550,135,120                  |
             
You can increase the `maxfiles` limit beyond 2,550,135,120 using a support request. For every 2,550,135,120 files you increase (or a fraction thereof), you need to increase the corresponding volume quota by 120 TiB. For example, if you increase `maxfiles` limit from 2,550,135,120 to 5,100,270,240 files (or any number in between), you need to increase the volume quota to at least 240 TiB.
 
The maximum `maxfiles` value for a 500 TiB volume is 10,625,563,000 files.

You cannot set `maxfiles` limits for data protection volumes via a quota request.  Azure NetApp Files automatically increases the `maxfiles` limit of a data protection volume to accommodate the number of files replicated to the volume.  When a failover happens to a data protection volume, the `maxfiles` limit remains the last value before the failover.  In this situation, you can submit a `maxfiles` [quota request](#request-limit-increase) for the volume.

## Request limit increase

You can create an Azure support request to increase the adjustable limits from the [Resource Limits](#resource-limits) table. 

>[!NOTE]
> Depending on available resources in the region and the limit increase requested, Azure support may require additional information in order to determine the feasibility of the request.

1. Go to **New Support Request** under **Support + troubleshooting**.   

2. Under the **Problem description** tab, provide the required information:
    1. For **Issue Type**, select **Service and Subscription Limits (Quotas)**.
    2. For **Subscription**, select your subscription. 
    3. For **Quota Type**, select **Storage: Azure NetApp Files limits**.  

    ![Screenshot that shows the Problem Description tab.](../media/azure-netapp-files/support-problem-descriptions.png)

3. Under the **Additional details** tab, select **Enter details** in the Request Details field.  

    ![Screenshot that shows the Details tab and the Enter Details field.](../media/azure-netapp-files/quota-additional-details.png)

4. To request limit increase, provide the following information in the Quota Details window that appears:
    1. In **Quota Type**, select the type of resource you want to increase.  
        For example:   
        * *Regional Capacity Quota per Subscription (TiB)*
        * *Number of NetApp accounts per Azure region per subscription*
        * *Number of volumes per subscription*

    2. In **Region Requested**, select your region.   
        The current and default sizes are displayed under Quota State.
    
    3. Enter a value to request an increase for the quota type you specified.
    
    ![Screenshot that shows how to display and request increase for regional quota.](../media/azure-netapp-files/quota-details-regional-request.png)

5. Select **Save and continue**. Select **Review + create** to create the request.
