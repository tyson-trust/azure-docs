# Enable Continuous Availability on existing SMB volumes

You can enable the SMB Continuous Availability (CA) feature when you [create a new SMB volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md#continuous-availability). You can also enable SMB CA on an existing SMB volume; this article shows you how to do so.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Custom applications are not supported with SMB Continuous Availability.
> 
> See the [**Enable Continuous Availability**](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes-smb.md#continuous-availability) option for additional details and considerations. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You should enable Continuous Availability for [Citrix App Layering](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-app-layering/4.html), SQL Server, and [FSLogix user profile containers](../virtual-desktop/create-fslogix-profile-container.md). Using SMB Continuous Availability shares for any other workload is not supported. This feature is currently supported on Windows SQL Server. Linux SQL Server is not currently supported.   
> If you are using a non-administrator (domain) account to install SQL Server, ensure that the account has the required security privilege assigned. If the domain account does not have the required security privilege (`SeSecurityPrivilege`), and the privilege cannot be set at the domain level, you can grant the privilege to the account by using the **Security privilege users** field of Active Directory connections. See [Create an Active Directory connection](create-active-directory-connections.md#create-an-active-directory-connection).
 
## Steps
       
1. Select the SMB volume that you want to have SMB CA enabled. Then select **Edit**.  
1. On the Edit window that appears, select the **Enable Continuous Availability** checkbox.

1. Reboot the Windows systems connecting to the existing SMB share.   

    > [!NOTE]
    > Selecting the **Enable Continuous Availability** option alone does not automatically make the existing SMB sessions continuously available. After selecting the option, be sure to reboot the server for the change to take effect.  

1. Use the following command to verify that CA is enabled and used on the system thatâ€™s mounting the volume:

    ```powershell-interactive
    get-smbconnection | select -Property servername,ContinuouslyAvailable
    ```
 
    You might need to install a newer PowerShell version. 

    If you know the server name, you can use the `-ServerName` parameter with the command. See the [Get-SmbConnection](/powershell/module/smbshare/get-smbconnection?view=windowsserver2019-ps&preserve-view=true) PowerShell command details.
