# Create an SMB volume for Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files supports creating volumes using NFS (NFSv3 or NFSv4.1), SMB3, or dual protocol (NFSv3 and SMB, or NFSv4.1 and SMB). A volume's capacity consumption counts against its pool's provisioned capacity. 

This article shows you how to create an SMB3 volume. For NFS volumes, see [Create an NFS volume](azure-netapp-files-create-volumes.md). For dual-protocol volumes, see [Create a dual-protocol volume](create-volumes-dual-protocol.md).

## Before you begin 

* You must have already set up a capacity pool. See [Create a capacity pool](azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool.md).     
* A subnet must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files. See [Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files](azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet.md).
* The [non-browsable shares](#non-browsable-share) and [access-based enumeration](#access-based-enumeration) features are currently in preview. You must register each feature before you can use it:

1. Register the feature: 

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSmbNonBrowsable
    Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSMBAccessBasedEnumeration
    ```

2. Check the status of the feature registration: 

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **RegistrationState** may be in the `Registering` state for up to 60 minutes before changing to `Registered`. Wait until the status is **Registered** before continuing.

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSmbNonBrowsable
    Get-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.NetApp -FeatureName ANFSMBAccessBasedEnumeration   
    ```
You can also use [Azure CLI commands](/cli/azure/feature) `az feature register` and `az feature show` to register the feature and display the registration status. 

## Configure Active Directory connections 

Before creating an SMB volume, you need to create an Active Directory connection. If you haven't configured Active Directory connections for Azure NetApp files, follow instructions described in [Create and manage Active Directory connections](create-active-directory-connections.md).

## Add an SMB volume

1. Select the **Volumes** blade from the Capacity Pools blade. 

    ![Navigate to Volumes](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-navigate-to-volumes.png)

2. Select **+ Add volume** to create a volume.  
    The Create a Volume window appears.

3. In the Create a Volume window, select **Create** and provide information for the following fields under the Basics tab:   
    * **Volume name**      
        Specify the name for the volume that you are creating.   

        Refer to [Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules.md#microsoftnetapp) for naming conventions on volumes. Additionally, you cannot use `default` or `bin` as the volume name.

    * **Capacity pool**  
        Specify the capacity pool where you want the volume to be created.

    * **Quota**  
        Specify the amount of logical storage that is allocated to the volume.  

        The **Available quota** field shows the amount of unused space in the chosen capacity pool that you can use towards creating a new volume. The size of the new volume must not exceed the available quota.  

    * **Large Volume**
        If the quota of your volume is less than 100 TiB, select **No**. If the quota of your volume is greater than 100 TiB, select **Yes**.  
        [!INCLUDE [Large volumes warning](includes/large-volumes-notice.md)]

    * **Throughput (MiB/S)**   
        If the volume is created in a manual QoS capacity pool, specify the throughput you want for the volume.   

        If the volume is created in an auto QoS capacity pool, the value displayed in this field is (quota x service level throughput).   

    * **Virtual network**  
        Specify the Azure virtual network (VNet) from which you want to access the volume.  

        The VNet you specify must have a subnet delegated to Azure NetApp Files. The Azure NetApp Files service can be accessed only from the same VNet or from a VNet that is in the same region as the volume through VNet peering. You can also access the volume from  your on-premises network through Express Route.   

    * **Subnet**  
        Specify the subnet that you want to use for the volume.  
        The subnet you specify must be delegated to Azure NetApp Files. 
        
        If you haven't delegated a subnet, you can select **Create new** on the Create a Volume page. Then in the Create Subnet page, specify the subnet information, and select **Microsoft.NetApp/volumes** to delegate the subnet for Azure NetApp Files. In each VNet, only one subnet can be delegated to Azure NetApp Files.

        ![Create subnet](../media/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-subnet.png)

    * **Network features**  
        In supported regions, you can specify whether you want to use **Basic** or **Standard** network features for the volume. See [Configure network features for a volume](configure-network-features.md) and [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](azure-netapp-files-network-topologies.md) for details.

    * **Encryption key source** 
        You can select `Microsoft Managed Key` or `Customer Managed Key`.  See [Configure customer-managed keys for Azure NetApp Files volume encryption](configure-customer-managed-keys.md) and [Azure NetApp Files double encryption at rest](double-encryption-at-rest.md) about using this field. 

    * **Availability zone**   
        This option lets you deploy the new volume in the logical availability zone that you specify. Select an availability zone where Azure NetApp Files resources are present. For details, see [Manage availability zone volume placement](manage-availability-zone-volume-placement.md).

    * If you want to apply an existing snapshot policy to the volume, select **Show advanced section** to expand it, specify whether you want to hide the snapshot path, and select a snapshot policy in the pull-down menu. 

        For information about creating a snapshot policy, see [Manage snapshot policies](snapshots-manage-policy.md).

        ![Show advanced selection](../media/azure-netapp-files/volume-create-advanced-selection.png)

4. Select **Protocol** and complete the following information:  
    * Select **SMB** as the protocol type for the volume.  

    * Select your **Active Directory** connection from the drop-down list.  
    
    * Specify a unique **share name** for the volume. This share name is used when you create mount targets. The requirements for the share name are as follows:   
        - It must be unique within each subnet in the region. 
        - It must start with an alphabetical character.
        - It can contain only letters, numbers, or dashes (`-`). 
        - The length must not exceed 80 characters.   

    * <a name="smb3-encryption"></a>If you want to enable encryption for SMB3, select **Enable SMB3 Protocol Encryption**.   

        This feature enables encryption for in-flight SMB3 data. SMB clients not using SMB3 encryption will not be able to access this volume.  Data at rest is encrypted regardless of this setting.   
        See [SMB encryption](azure-netapp-files-smb-performance.md#smb-encryption) for additional information.

    * <a name="access-based-enumeration"></a> If you want to enable access-based enumeration, select **Enable Access Based Enumeration**.

        This feature will hide directories and files created under a share from users who do not have access permissions to the files or folders under the share. Users will still be able to view the share.

    * <a name="non-browsable-share"></a> You can enable the **non-browsable-share feature.**

        This feature prevents the Windows client from browsing the share. The share does not show up in the Windows File Browser or in the list of shares when you run the `net view \\server /all` command.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Both the access-based enumeration and non-browsable shares features are currently in preview. If this is your first time using either, refer to the steps in [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) to register either feature.

    * <a name="continuous-availability"></a>If you want to enable Continuous Availability for the SMB volume, select **Enable Continuous Availability**.    
      
        >[!IMPORTANT]
        >You should enable Continuous Availability for Citrix App Layering, SQL Server, and [FSLogix user profile containers](../virtual-desktop/create-fslogix-profile-container.md). Using SMB Continuous Availability shares for workloads other than Citrix App Layering, SQL Server, and FSLogix user profile containers is *not* supported. This feature is currently supported on Windows SQL Server. Linux SQL Server is not currently supported. If you are using a non-administrator (domain) account to install SQL Server, ensure that the account has the required security privilege assigned. If the domain account does not have the required security privilege (`SeSecurityPrivilege`), and the privilege cannot be set at the domain level, you can grant the privilege to the account by using the **Security privilege users** field of Active Directory connections. See [Create an Active Directory connection](create-active-directory-connections.md#create-an-active-directory-connection).

        **Custom applications are not supported with SMB Continuous Availability.**

5. Select **Review + Create** to review the volume details. Then select **Create** to create the SMB volume.

    The volume you created appears in the Volumes page. 
 
    A volume inherits subscription, resource group, location attributes from its capacity pool. To monitor the volume deployment status, you can use the Notifications tab.

## Control access to an SMB volume  

Access to an SMB volume is managed through permissions. 

### NTFS file and folder permissions  

You can set permissions for a file or folder by using the **Security** tab of the object's properties in the Windows SMB client.
 
![Set file and folder permissions](../media/azure-netapp-files/set-file-folder-permissions.png) 

### Modify SMB share permissions

You can modify SMB share permissions using Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Modifying SMB share permissions poses a risk. If the users or groups assigned to the share properties are removed from the Active Directory, or if the permissions for the share become unusable, then the entire share will become inaccessible.

1. To open Computer Management MMC on any Windows server, in the Control Panel, select **Administrative Tools > Computer Management**.
1. Select **Action > Connect to another computer**.
1. In the **Select Computer** dialog box, enter the name of the Azure NetApp Files FQDN or IP address or select **Browse** to locate the storage system.
1. Select **OK** to connect the MMC to the remote server.
1. When the MMC connects to the remote server, in the navigation pane, select **Shared Folders > Shares**.
1. In the display pane that lists the shares, double-click a share to display its properties. In the **Properties** dialog box, modify the properties as needed.
