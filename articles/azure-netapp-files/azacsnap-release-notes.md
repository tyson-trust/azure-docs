## Jun-2023

### AzAcSnap 8b (Build: 1AD3679)

AzAcSnap 8b is being released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Fixes and Improvements:
  - General improvement to `azacsnap` command exit codes.
    - `azacsnap` should return an exit code of 0 (zero) when it has run as expected, otherwise it should return an exit code of non-zero.  For example, running `azacsnap` will return non-zero as it has not done anything and will show usage information whereas `azacsnap -h` will return exit-code of zero as it's expected to return usage information.
    - Any failure in `--runbefore` exits before any backup activity and returns the `--runbefore` exit code.
    - Any failure in `--runafter` returns the `--runafter` exit code.
  - Backup (`-c backup`) changes:
    - Change in the Db2 workflow to move the protected-paths query outside the WRITE SUSPEND, Storage Snapshot, WRITE RESUME workflow to improve resilience. (Preview)
    - Fix for missing snapshot name (`azSnapshotName`)  in `--runafter` command environment.

## May-2023

### AzAcSnap 8a (Build: 1AC55A6)

AzAcSnap 8a is being released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Fixes and Improvements:
  - Configure (`-c configure`) changes:
    - Fix for `-c configure` related changes in AzAcSnap 8.
    - Improved workflow guidance for better customer experience.

Download the [AzAcSnap 8a](https://aka.ms/azacsnap-8a) installer.

### AzAcSnap 8 (Build: 1AC279E)

AzAcSnap 8 is being released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Fixes and Improvements:
  - Restore (`-c restore`) changes:
    - New ability to use `-c restore` to `--restore revertvolume` for Azure NetApp Files.
  - Backup (`-c backup`) changes:
    - Fix for incorrect error output when using `-c backup` and the database has ‘backint’ configured.
    - Remove lower-case conversion for anfBackup rename-only option using `-c backup` so the snapshot name maintains case of Volume name.
    - Fix for when a snapshot is created even though SAP HANA wasn't put into backup-mode.  Now if SAP HANA cannot be put into backup-mode, AzAcSnap immediately exits with an error.
  - Details (`-c details`) changes:
    - Fix for listing snapshot details with `-c details` when using Azure Large Instance storage.
  - Logging enhancements:
    - Extra logging output to syslog (for example, `/var/log/messages`) on failure.
    - New “mainlog” (`azacsnap.log`) to provide a more parse-able high-level log of commands run with success or failure result.
  - New global settings file (`.azacsnaprc`) to control behavior of azacsnap, including location of “mainlog” file.

Download the [AzAcSnap 8](https://aka.ms/azacsnap-8) installer.

## Feb-2023

### AzAcSnap 7a (Build: 1AA8343)

AzAcSnap 7a is being released with the following fixes:

- Fixes for `-c restore` commands:
  - Enable mounting volumes on HLI (BareMetal) where the volumes have been reverted to a prior state when using `-c restore --restore revertvolume`.
  - Correctly set ThroughputMiBps on volume clones for Azure NetApp Files volumes in an Auto QoS Capacity Pool when using `-c restore --restore snaptovol`.

Download the [AzAcSnap 7a](https://aka.ms/azacsnap-7a) installer.

## Dec-2022

### AzAcSnap 7 (Build: 1A8FDFF)

AzAcSnap 7 is being released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Fixes and Improvements:
  - Backup (`-c backup`) changes:
    - Shorten suffix added to the snapshot name.  The previous 26 character suffix of "YYYY-MM-DDThhhhss-nnnnnnnZ" was too long.  The suffix is now an 11 character hex-decimal based on the ten-thousandths of a second since the Unix epoch to avoid naming collisions for example, F2D212540D5.
    - Increased validation when creating snapshots to avoid failures on snapshot creation retry.
    - Time out when executing AzAcSnap mechanism to disable/enable backint (`autoDisableEnableBackint=true`) now aligns with other SAP HANA related operation timeout values.
    - Azure Backup now allows third party snapshot-based backups without impact to streaming backups (also known as 'backint'). Therefore, AzAcSnap 'backint' detection logic has been reordered to allow for future deprecation of this feature.  By default this setting is disabled (`autoDisableEnableBackint=false`). For customers who have relied on this feature to take snapshots with AzAcSnap and use Azure Backup, keeping this value as true means AzAcSnap 7 continues to disable/enable backint.  As this setting is no longer necessary for Azure Backup, we recommend testing AzAcSnap backups with the value of `autoDisableEnableBackint=false`, and then if successful make the same change in your production deployment.
  - Restore (`-c restore`) changes:
    - Ability to create a custom suffix for Volume clones created when using `-c restore --restore snaptovol` either:
      - via the command-line with `--clonesuffix <custom suffix>`.
      - interactively when running the command without the `--force` option.
    - When doing a `--restore snaptovol` on ANF, then Volume Clone inherits the new 'NetworkFeatures' setting from the Source Volume.
    - Can now do a restore if there are no Data Volumes configured.  It will only restore the Other Volumes using the Other Volumes latest snapshot (the `--snapshotfilter` option only applies to Data Volumes).
    - Extra logging for `-c restore` command to help with user debugging.
  - Test (`-c test`) changes:
    - Now tests managing snapshots for all otherVolume(s) and all dataVolume(s).
- Features moved to GA (generally available):
  - None.
- Features added to [Preview](azacsnap-preview.md):
  - Preliminary support for Azure NetApp Files Backup.
  - Db2 database support adding options to configure, test, and snapshot backup IBM Db2 in an application consistent manner.

## Jul-2022

### AzAcSnap 6 (Build: 1A5F0B8)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AzAcSnap 6 brings a new release model for AzAcSnap and includes fully supported GA features and Preview features in a single release.  

Since AzAcSnap v5.0 was released as GA in April 2021, there have been eight releases of AzAcSnap across two branches. Our goal with the new release model is to align with how Azure components are released.  This change allows moving features from Preview to GA (without having to move an entire branch), and introduce new Preview features (without having to create a new branch). From AzAcSnap 6, we have a single branch with fully supported GA features and Preview features (which are subject to Microsoft's Preview Ts&Cs). It’s important to note customers can't accidentally use Preview features, and must enable them with the `--preview` command line option.  Therefore the next release will be AzAcSnap 7, which could include; patches (if necessary) for GA features, current Preview features moving to GA, or new Preview features.

AzAcSnap 6 is being released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Features moved to GA (generally available):
  - Oracle Database support.
  - Backint integration to work with Azure Backup.
  - RunBefore/RunAfter command line options to execute custom shell scripts and commands before or after taking storage snapshots.
- Features in Preview:
  - Azure Key Vault to store Service Principal content.
  - Azure Managed Disk as an alternate storage back-end.
- ANF Client API Version updated to 2021-10-01.
- Change to workflow for handling Backint to re-enable backint configuration should there be a failure when putting SAP HANA in a consistent state for snapshot.

## May-2022

### AzAcSnap v5.0.3 (Build: 20220524.14204) - Patch update to v5.0.2

AzAcSnap v5.0.3 (Build: 20220524.14204) is provided as a patch update to the v5.0 branch with the following fix:

- Fix for handling delimited identifiers when querying SAP HANA.  This issue only impacted SAP HANA in HSR-HA node when there's a Secondary node configured with 'logreplay_readaccss' and has been resolved.

### AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220524.15550)

AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220524.15550) is an updated build to extend the preview expiry date for 90 days.  This update contains the fix for handling delimited identifiers when querying SAP HANA as provided in v5.0.3.

## Mar-2022

### AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220302.81795)

AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220302.81795) has been released with the following new features:

- Azure Key Vault support for securely storing the Service Principal.
- A new option for `-c backup --volume`, which has the `all` parameter value.

## Feb-2022

### AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220220.55340)

AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220220.55340) has been released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Resolved failure in matching `--dbsid` command line option with `sid` entry in the JSON configuration file for Oracle databases when using the `-c restore` command.

### AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220203.77807)

AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220203.77807) has been released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Minor update to resolve STDOUT buffer limitations.  Now the list of Oracle table files put into archive-mode is sent to an external file rather than output in the main AzAcSnap log file.  The external file is in the same location and basename as the log file, but with a ".protected-tables" extension (output filename detailed in the AzAcSnap log file).  It's overwritten each time `azacsnap` runs.

## Jan-2022

### AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220125.85030)

AzAcSnap v5.1 Preview (Build: 20220125.85030) has been released with the following new features:

- Oracle Database support
- Backint Co-existence
- Azure Managed Disk
- RunBefore and RunAfter capability

## Aug-2021

### AzAcSnap v5.0.2 (Build: 20210827.19086) - Patch update to v5.0.1

AzAcSnap v5.0.2 (Build: 20210827.19086) is provided as a patch update to the v5.0 branch with the following fixes and improvements:

- Ignore `ssh` 255 exit codes.  In some cases the `ssh` command, which is used to communicate with storage on Azure Large Instance, would emit an exit code of 255 when there were no errors or execution failures  (refer `man ssh` "EXIT STATUS") - then AzAcSnap would trap this exit code as a failure and abort.  With this update extra verification is done to validate correct execution, this includes parsing `ssh` STDOUT and STDERR for errors in addition to traditional exit code checks.
- Fix the installer's check for the location of the hdbuserstore.  The installer would search the filesystem for an incorrect source directory for the hdbuserstore location for the user running the install - the installer now searches for `~/.hdb`.  This fix is applicable to systems (for example, Azure Large Instance) where the hdbuserstore was pre-configured for the `root` user before installing `azacsnap`.
- Installer now shows the version it will install/extract (if the installer is run without any arguments).

## May-2021

### AzAcSnap v5.0.1 (Build: 20210524.14837) - Patch update to v5.0

AzAcSnap v5.0.1 (Build: 20210524.14837) is provided as a patch update to the v5.0 branch with the following fixes and improvements:

- Improved exit code handling.  In some cases AzAcSnap would emit an exit code of 0 (zero), even after an execution failure when the exit code should have been non-zero.  Exit codes should now only be zero on successfully running `azacsnap` to completion and non-zero if there's any failure.  
- AzAcSnap's internal error handling has been extended to capture and emit the exit code of the external commands run by AzAcSnap.

## April-2021

### AzAcSnap v5.0 (Build: 20210421.6349) - GA Released (21-April-2021)

AzAcSnap v5.0 (Build: 20210421.6349) has been made Generally Available and for this build had the following fixes and improvements:

- The hdbsql retry timeout (to wait for a response from SAP HANA) is automatically set to half of the "savePointAbortWaitSeconds" to avoid race conditions.  The setting for "savePointAbortWaitSeconds" can be modified directly in the JSON configuration file and must be a minimum of 600 seconds.

## March-2021

### AzAcSnap v5.0 Preview (Build: 20210318.30771)

AzAcSnap v5.0 Preview (Build: 20210318.30771) has been released with the following fixes and improvements:

- Removed the need to add the AZACSNAP user into the SAP HANA Tenant DBs, see the [Enable communication with database](azacsnap-installation.md#enable-communication-with-database) section.
- Fix to allow a [restore](azacsnap-cmd-ref-restore.md) with volumes configured with Manual QOS.
- Added mutex control to throttle SSH connections for Azure Large Instance.
- Fix installer for handling path names with spaces and other related issues.
