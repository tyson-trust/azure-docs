# Metrics for Azure NetApp Files

Azure NetApp Files provides metrics on allocated storage, actual storage usage, volume IOPS, and latency. By analyzing these metrics, you can gain a better understanding on the usage pattern and volume performance of your NetApp accounts.  

## Ways to access metrics 

Azure NetApp Files metrics are natively integrated into Azure monitor. From within the Azure portal, you can find metrics for Azure NetApp Files capacity pools and volumes from two locations:

- From Azure monitor, select **Metrics**, select a capacity pool or volume. Then select **Metric** to view the available metrics:

- From the Azure NetApp Files capacity pool or volume, select **Metrics**. Then select **Metric** to view the available metrics:

## <a name="capacity_pools"></a>Usage metrics for capacity pools

- *Pool Allocated Size*   
    The provisioned size of the pool.

- *Pool Allocated to Volume Size*  
    The total of volume quota (GiB) in a given capacity pool (that is, the total of the volumes' provisioned sizes in the capacity pool).  
    This size is the size you selected during volume creation.  

- *Pool Consumed Size*  
    The total of logical space (GiB) used across volumes in a capacity pool.  

- *Total Snapshot Size for the Pool*    
    The sum of snapshot size from all volumes in the pool.

## <a name="volumes"></a>Usage metrics for volumes

- *Percentage Volume Consumed Size*    
    The percentage of the volume consumed, including snapshots.  
    Aggregation metrics (for example, min, max) are not supported for percentage volume consumed size.
- *Volume Allocated Size*   
    The provisioned size of a volume
- *Volume Quota Size*    
    The quota size (GiB) the volume is provisioned with.   
- *Volume Consumed Size*   
    Logical size of the volume (used bytes).  
    This size includes logical space used by active file systems and snapshots.  
- *Volume Snapshot Size*   
   The size of all snapshots in a volume.  

## Performance metrics for volumes

> [!NOTE] 
> Volume latency for *Average Read Latency* and *Average Write Latency* is measured within the storage service and does not include network latency.

- *Average Read Latency*   
    The average time for reads from the volume in milliseconds.
- *Average Write Latency*   
    The average time for writes from the volume in milliseconds.
- *Read IOPS*   
    The number of reads to the volume per second.
- *Write IOPS*   
    The number of writes to the volume per second.

## <a name="replication"></a>Volume replication metrics

> [!NOTE] 
> * Network transfer size (for example, the *Volume replication total transfer* metrics) might differ from the source or destination volumes of a cross-region replication. This behavior is a result of efficient replication engine being used to minimize the network transfer cost.
> * Volume replication metrics are currently populated for replication destination volumes and not the source of the replication relationship.

- *Is volume replication status healthy*   
    The condition of the replication relationship. A healthy state is denoted by `1`. An unhealthy state is denoted by `0`.

- *Is volume replication transferring*    
    Whether the status of the volume replication is ‘transferring’. 

- *Volume replication lag time* <br>
    Lag time is the actual amount of time the replication lags behind the source. It indicates the age of the replicated data in the destination volume relative to the source volume.

> [!NOTE]
> When assessing the health status of the volume replication, consider the volume replication lag time. If the lag time is greater than the replication schedule, the replication volume will not catch up to the source. To resolve this issue, adjust the replication speed or the replication schedule. 

- *Volume replication last transfer duration*   
    The amount of time in seconds it took for the last transfer to complete. 

- *Volume replication last transfer size*    
    The total number of bytes transferred as part of the last transfer. 

- *Volume replication progress*    
    The total amount of data transferred for the current transfer operation. 

- *Volume replication total transfer*   
    The cumulative bytes transferred for the relationship. 

## Throughput metrics for capacity pools   

* *Pool allocated throughput*    
    Sum of the throughput of all the volumes belonging to the pool.
    
* *Provisioned throughput for the pool*   
    Provisioned throughput of this pool.


## Throughput metrics for volumes   

* *Read throughput*   
    Read throughput in bytes per second.
    
* *Total throughput*   
    Sum of all throughput in bytes per second.

* *Write throughput*    
    Write throughput in bytes per second.

* *Other throughput*   
    Other throughput (that isn't read or write) in bytes per second.

## Volume backup metrics  

* *Is Volume Backup Enabled*   
    Shows whether backup is enabled for the volume. `1` is enabled. `0` is disabled.

* *Is Volume Backup Operation Complete*   
    Shows whether the last volume backup or restore operation is successfully completed.  `1` is successful. `0` is unsuccessful.

* *Is Volume Backup Suspended*   
    Shows whether the backup policy is suspended for the volume.  `1` isn't suspended. `0` is suspended.

* *Volume Backup Bytes*   
    The total bytes backed up for this volume.

* *Volume Backup Last Transferred Bytes*   
    The total bytes transferred for the last backup or restore operation.
