# Tutorial: Use dynamic configuration using push refresh in a Java Spring app

The App Configuration Java Spring client library supports updating configuration on demand without causing an application to restart. An application can be configured to detect changes in App Configuration using one or both of the following two approaches.

- Poll Model: This is the default behavior that uses polling to detect changes in configuration. Once the cached value of a setting expires, the next call to `AppConfigurationRefresh`'s `refreshConfigurations` sends a request to the server to check if the configuration has changed, and pulls the updated configuration if needed.

- Push Model: This uses [App Configuration events](./concept-app-configuration-event.md) to detect changes in configuration. Once App Configuration is set up to send key value change events with Event Grid, with a [Web Hook](../event-grid/handler-event-hubs.md), the application can use these events to optimize the total number of requests needed to keep the configuration updated.

This tutorial shows how you can implement dynamic configuration updates in your code using push refresh. It builds on the app introduced in the quickstarts. Before you continue, finish [Create a Java Spring app with App Configuration](./quickstart-java-spring-app.md) first.

You can use any code editor to do the steps in this tutorial. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an excellent option that's available on the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Set up a subscription to send configuration change events from App Configuration to a Web Hook
> * Deploy a Spring Boot application to App Service
> * Set up your Java Spring app to update its configuration in response to changes in App Configuration.
> * Consume the latest configuration in your application.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription - [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- A supported [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk) with version 11.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) version 3.0 or above.
- An existing Azure App Configuration Store.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Setup Push Refresh

1. Open *pom.xml* and update the file with the following dependencies.

    ### [Spring Boot 3](#tab/spring-boot-3)

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-appconfiguration-config-web</artifactId>
        <version>5.4.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Adds the Ability to Push Refresh -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    ### [Spring Boot 2](#tab/spring-boot-2)

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-appconfiguration-config-web</artifactId>
        <version>4.10.0</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Adds the Ability to Push Refresh -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```

    ---


1. Set up [Maven App Service Deployment](../app-service/quickstart-java.md?tabs=javase) so the application can be deployed to Azure App Service via Maven.

   ```console
   mvn com.microsoft.azure:azure-webapp-maven-plugin:2.5.0:config
   ```

1. Open bootstrap.properties and configure Azure App Configuration Push Refresh and Azure Service Bus

   ```properties
   # Azure App Configuration Properties
   spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].connection-string= ${AppConfigurationConnectionString}
   spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].monitoring.enabled= true
   spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].monitoring.refresh-interval= 30d
   spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].monitoring.triggers[0].key= sentinel
   spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].monitoring.push-notification.primary-token.name= myToken
   spring.cloud.azure.appconfiguration.stores[0].monitoring.push-notification.primary-token.secret= myTokenSecret
   
   management.endpoints.web.exposure.include= appconfiguration-refresh
   ```

A random delay is added before the cached value is marked as dirty to reduce potential throttling. The default maximum delay before the cached value is marked as dirty is 30 seconds.

> [!NOTE]
> The Primary token name should be stored in App Configuration as a key, and then the Primary token secret should be stores as an App Configuration Key Vault Reference for added security.

## Build and run the app in app service

Event Grid Web Hooks require validation on creation. You can validate by following this [guide](../event-grid/webhook-event-delivery.md) or by starting your application with Azure App Configuration Spring Web Library already configured, which will register your application for you. To use an event subscription, follow the steps in the next two sections.

1. Set the environment variable to your App Configuration instance's connection string:

    #### [Windows command prompt](#tab/cmd)

    ```cmd
    setx AppConfigurationConnectionString <connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store>
    ```

    #### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

    ```PowerShell
    $Env:AppConfigurationConnectionString = <connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store>
    ```

    #### [Bash](#tab/bash)

    ```bash
    export AppConfigurationConnectionString = <connection-string-of-your-app-configuration-store>
    ```

1. Update your `pom.xml` under the `azure-webapp-maven-plugin`'s `configuration` add

   ```xml
   <appSettings>
     <AppConfigurationConnectionString>${AppConfigurationConnectionString}</AppConfigurationConnectionString>
   </appSettings>
   ```

1. Run the following command to build the console app:

   ```shell
    mvn package
   ```

1. After the build successfully completes, run the following command to run the app locally:

    ```shell
    mvn azure-webapp:deploy
    ```

## Set up an event subscription

1. Open the App Configuration resource in the Azure portal, then click on `+ Event Subscription` in the `Events` pane.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/events-pane.png" alt-text="The events pane has an option to create new Subscriptions." :::

1. Enter a name for the `Event Subscription` and the `System Topic`. By default the Event Types Key-Value modified and Key-Value deleted are set, this can be changed along with using the Filters tab to choose the exact reasons a Push Event will be sent.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/create-event-subscription.png" alt-text="Events require a name, topic, and filters." :::

1. Select the `Endpoint Type` as `Web Hook`, select `Select an endpoint`.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/event-subscription-webhook-endpoint.png" alt-text="Selecting Endpoint creates a new blade to enter the endpoint URI." :::

1. The endpoint is the URI of the application + "/actuator/appconfiguration-refresh?{your-token-name}={your-token-secret}". For example `https://my-azure-webapp.azurewebsites.net/actuator/appconfiguration-refresh?myToken=myTokenSecret`

1. Click on `Create` to create the event subscription. When `Create` is selected a registration request for the Web Hook will be sent to your application. This is received by the Azure App Configuration client library, verified, and returns a valid response.

1. Click on `Event Subscriptions` in the `Events` pane to validate that the subscription was created successfully.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/event-subscription-view-webhook.png" alt-text="Web Hook shows up in a table on the bottom of the page." :::

> [!NOTE]
> When subscribing for configuration changes, one or more filters can be used to reduce the number of events sent to your application. These can be configured either as [Event Grid subscription filters](../event-grid/event-filtering.md) or [Service Bus subscription filters](../service-bus-messaging/topic-filters.md). For example, a subscription filter can be used to only subscribe to events for changes in a key that starts with a specific string.

## Verify and test application

1. After your application is running, use *curl* to test your application, for example:

   ```cmd
   curl -X GET https://my-azure-webapp.azurewebsites.net
   ```

1. Open the **Azure Portal** and navigate to your App Configuration resource associated with your application. Select **Configuration Explorer** under **Operations** and update the values of the following keys:

    | Key | Value |
    |---|---|
    | application/config.message | Hello - Updated |

1. Refresh the browser page to see the new message displayed.
