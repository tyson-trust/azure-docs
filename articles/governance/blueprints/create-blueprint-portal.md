# Quickstart: Define and assign a blueprint in the portal

In this tutorial, you learn to use Azure Blueprints to do some of the common tasks related to creating, publishing, and assigning a blueprint within your organization. This skill helps you define common patterns to develop reusable and rapidly deployable configurations, based on Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, policy, and security.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
before you begin.
- To create blueprints, your account needs the following permissions:
   - Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/write - Create a blueprint definition
   - Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/artifacts/write - Create artifacts on a blueprint definition
   - Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/versions/write - Publish a blueprint

## Create a blueprint

The first step in defining a standard pattern for compliance is to compose a blueprint from the
available resources. Let's create a blueprint named *MyBlueprint* to configure role and policy
assignments for the subscription. Then you add a resource group, an ARM template, and a role
assignment on the resource group.

1. Select **All services** in the left pane. Search for and select **Blueprints**.

1. Select **Blueprint definitions**, and then select **+ Create blueprint**.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/create-blueprint-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Create blueprint button on the Blueprint definitions page." border="false":::

   Or, select **Getting started** > **Create** to go straight to creating a blueprint.

1. Select **Start with blank blueprint** from the card at the top of the built-in blueprints list.

1. Provide a blueprint name, such as *MyBlueprint*. (You can use up to 48 letters and numbers,
   but no spaces or special characters.) Leave **Blueprint description** blank
   for now.

1. In the **Definition location** box, select the ellipsis on the right. Then select the
   [management group](../management-groups/overview.md) or subscription where you want to save the blueprint, and choose **Select**.

1. Verify that the information is correct. The **Blueprint name** and **Definition location** fields can't be changed later. Then select **Next : Artifacts** at the bottom of the page, or the **Artifacts** tab at the top of the page.

1. Add a role assignment at the subscription level:

   1. Under **Subscription**, select **+ Add artifact**. The **Add artifact** window opens on
      the right side of the browser.

   1. For **Artifact type**, select **Role assignment**.

   1. For **Role**, select **Contributor**. Leave the **Add user, app or group** box with the
      check box that indicates a dynamic parameter.

   1. Select **Add** to add this artifact to the blueprint.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Role assignment artifact options for adding to a blueprint definition." border="false":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > Most artifacts support parameters. A parameter that's assigned a value during blueprint
   > creation is a _static parameter_. If the parameter is assigned during blueprint assignment, it's a _dynamic parameter_. For more information, see [Blueprint parameters](./concepts/parameters.md).

1. Add a policy assignment at the subscription level:

   1. Under the role assignment artifact, select **+ Add artifact**.

   1. For **Artifact type**, select **Policy assignment**.

   1. Change **Type** to **Built-in**. In **Search**, enter **tag**.

   1. Change focus out of **Search** for the filtering to occur. Select **Append tag and its
      value to resource groups**.

   1. Select **Add** to add this artifact to the blueprint.

1. Select the row of the policy assignment **Append tag and its value to resource groups**.

1. The window to provide parameters to the artifact as part of the blueprint definition opens. You can set the parameters for all assignments (static parameters) based on this blueprint, instead of during assignment (dynamic parameters). This example uses dynamic parameters during blueprint assignment, so leave the defaults and select **Cancel**.

1. Add a resource group at the subscription level:

   1. Under **Subscription**, select **+ Add artifact**.

   1. For **Artifact type**, select **Resource group**.

   1. Leave the **Artifact display name**, **Resource Group Name**, and **Location** boxes blank. Make sure that the check box is checked for each parameter property to make them dynamic parameters.

   1. Select **Add** to add this artifact to the blueprint.

1. Add a template under the resource group:

   1. Under **ResourceGroup**, select **+ Add artifact**.

   1. For **Artifact type**, select **Azure Resource Manager template**. Set **Artifact display
      name** to **StorageAccount**, and leave **Description** blank.

   1. On the **Template** tab in the editor box, paste the following ARM template. After you paste the template, select the **Parameters** tab, and note that the template parameters `storageAccountType` and `location` were detected. Each parameter was automatically  detected and populated, but configured as a dynamic parameter.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If you're importing the template, ensure that the file is only JSON and doesn't include
      > HTML. When you're pointing to a URL on GitHub, ensure that you have selected **RAW** to get the pure JSON file, and not the one wrapped with HTML for display on GitHub. An error occurs if the imported template is not purely JSON.

      ```json
      {
          "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
          "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
          "parameters": {
              "storageAccountType": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "defaultValue": "Standard_LRS",
                  "allowedValues": [
                      "Standard_LRS",
                      "Standard_GRS",
                      "Standard_ZRS",
                      "Premium_LRS"
                  ],
                  "metadata": {
                      "description": "Storage Account type"
                  }
              },
              "location": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "defaultValue": "[resourceGroup().location]",
                  "metadata": {
                      "description": "Location for all resources."
                  }
              }
          },
          "variables": {
              "storageAccountName": "[concat('store', uniquestring(resourceGroup().id))]"
          },
          "resources": [{
              "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
              "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
              "location": "[parameters('location')]",
              "apiVersion": "2018-07-01",
              "sku": {
                  "name": "[parameters('storageAccountType')]"
              },
              "kind": "StorageV2",
              "properties": {}
          }],
          "outputs": {
              "storageAccountName": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "value": "[variables('storageAccountName')]"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

   1. Clear the **storageAccountType** check box, and note that the dropdown list contains only
      values included in the ARM template under `allowedValues`. Select the box to set it back to a dynamic parameter.

   1. Select **Add** to add this artifact to the blueprint.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/add-resource-manager-template.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Resource Manager template artifact options for adding to a blueprint definition." border="false":::

1. Your completed blueprint should look similar to the following. In the **Parameters** column, notice that each artifact has **_x_ out of _y_ parameters populated**. The dynamic parameters are set during each assignment of the blueprint.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/completed-blueprint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a completed blueprint definition with each artifact type." border="false":::

1. Now that you've added all planned artifacts, select **Save Draft** at the bottom of the page.

## Edit a blueprint

In [Create a blueprint](#create-a-blueprint), you didn't provide a description or add the role
assignment to the new resource group. You can fix both by following these steps:

1. Select **Blueprint definitions** from the page on the left.

1. In the list of blueprints, select and hold (or right-click) the one that you previously created. Then select **Edit blueprint**.

1. In **Blueprint description**, provide some information about the blueprint and the artifacts that compose it. In this case, enter something like: *This blueprint sets tag policy and role assignment on the subscription, creates a ResourceGroup, and deploys a resource template and role assignment to that ResourceGroup.*

1. Select **Next : Artifacts** at the bottom of the page, or the **Artifacts** tab at the top of the page.

1. Add a role assignment under the resource group:

   1. Under **ResourceGroup**, select **+ Add artifact**.

   1. For **Artifact type**, select **Role assignment**.

   1. Under **Role**, select **Owner**, and clear the check box under the **Add user, app or group** box.

   1. Search for and select a user, app, or group to add. This artifact uses a static parameter set, the same in every assignment of this blueprint.

   1. Select **Add** to add this artifact to the blueprint.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/add-role-assignment-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the second role assignment artifact options for adding to a blueprint definition." border="false":::

1. Your completed blueprint should look similar to the following. Notice that the newly added role assignment shows **1 out of 1 parameters populated**. That means it's a static parameter.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/completed-blueprint-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the second completed blueprint definition with the additional role assignment artifact." border="false":::

1. Select **Save Draft** now that it has been updated.

## Publish a blueprint

Now that you've added all the planned artifacts to the blueprint, it's time to publish it. Publishing makes the blueprint available to be assigned to a subscription.

1. Select **Blueprint definitions** from the page on the left.

1. In the list of blueprints, select and hold (or right-click) the one you previously created. Then select **Publish blueprint**.

1. In the pane that opens, provide a **Version** (letters, numbers, and hyphens with a maximum
   length of 20 characters), such as **v1**. Optionally, enter text in **Change notes**, such as *First publish*.

1. Select **Publish** at the bottom of the page.

## Assign a blueprint

After you publish a blueprint, you can assign it to a subscription. Assign the blueprint
that you created to one of the subscriptions under your management group hierarchy. If the blueprint is saved to a subscription, it can only be assigned to that subscription.

1. Select **Blueprint definitions** from the page on the left.

1. In the list of blueprints, select and hold (or right-click) the one that you previously created (or select the ellipsis). Then select **Assign blueprint**.

1. On the **Assign blueprint** page, in the **Subscription** dropdown list, select the
   subscriptions to which you want to deploy this blueprint.

   If there are supported Enterprise offerings available from
   [Azure Billing](../../cost-management-billing/index.yml), a **Create new** link is activated
   under the **Subscription** box. Follow these steps:

   1. Select the **Create new** link to create a new subscription instead of selecting existing
      ones.

   1. For **Display name**, enter a name for the new subscription.

   1. For **Offer**, select the available offer from the dropdown list.

   1. For **Management group**, select the ellipsis to choose the [management group](../management-groups/overview.md) that the subscription will be a child of.

   1. Select **Create** at the bottom of the page.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/assignment-create-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create a subscription window and options for the new subscription." border="false":::

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > The new subscription is created immediately after you select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > An assignment is created for each subscription that you select. You can make changes to a single subscription assignment at a later time, without forcing changes on the remainder of the selected subscriptions.

1. For **Assignment name**, provide a unique name for this assignment.

1. In **Location**, select a region for the managed identity and subscription deployment object to be created in. Azure Blueprints uses this managed identity to deploy all artifacts in the assigned blueprint. To learn more, see [Managed identities for Azure resources](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

1. For the **Blueprint definition version** dropdown list selection of **Published** versions, leave the **v1** entry as it is. (The default is the most recently published version.)

1. For **Lock Assignment**, leave the default of **Don't Lock**. For more information, see
   [Blueprints resource locking](./concepts/resource-locking.md).

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/assignment-locking-mi.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the locking assignment and managed identity options for the blueprint assignment." border="false":::

1. Under **Managed Identity**, leave the default of **System assigned**.

1. For the subscription-level role assignment **[User group or application name] : Contributor**, search for and select a user, app, or group.

1. For the subscription-level policy assignment, set **Tag Name** to **CostCenter**, and set **Tag Value** to **ContosoIT**.

1. For **ResourceGroup**, provide a name of **StorageAccount** and a location of **East US   2** from the dropdown list.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For each artifact that you added under the resource group during blueprint definition, that artifact is indented to align with the resource group or object that you'll deploy it with. Artifacts that either don't take parameters, or have no parameters to be defined at assignment, are listed only for contextual information.

1. On the ARM template **StorageAccount**, select **Standard_GRS** for the **storageAccountType** parameter.

1. Read the information box at the bottom of the page, and then select **Assign**.

## Track deployment of a blueprint

When you assign a blueprint to one or more subscriptions, two things happen:

- The blueprint is added to the **Assigned blueprints** page for each subscription.
- The process of deploying all the artifacts defined by the blueprint begins.

Now that you've assigned the blueprint to a subscription, verify the progress of the deployment:

1. Select **Assigned blueprints** from the page on the left.

1. In the list of blueprints, select and hold (or right-click) the one that you previously assigned. Then select **View assignment details**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/create-blueprint-portal/view-assignment-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the blueprint assignment context menu with the View assignment details option selected." border="false":::

1. On the **Blueprint assignment** page, validate that all artifacts were successfully deployed, and that there were no errors during the deployment. If errors occurred, see [Troubleshooting blueprints](./troubleshoot/general.md) for steps to determine what went wrong.

## Clean up resources

### Unassign a blueprint

If you no longer need a blueprint assignment, remove it from a subscription. The blueprint might have been replaced by a newer blueprint with updated patterns, policies, and designs. When a blueprint is removed, the artifacts assigned as part of that blueprint are left behind. To remove a blueprint assignment, follow these steps:

1. Select **Assigned blueprints** from the page on the left.

1. In the list of blueprints, select the blueprint that you want to unassign. Then select    **Unassign blueprint** at the top of the page.

1. Read the confirmation message, and then select **OK**.

### Delete a blueprint

1. Select **Blueprint definitions** from the page on the left.

1. Right-click the blueprint that you want to delete, and select **Delete blueprint**. Then select **Yes** in the confirmation dialog box.

> [!NOTE]
> Deleting a blueprint in this method also deletes all published versions of the selected blueprint. To delete a single version, open the blueprint, and select the **Published versions** tab. Then select the version that you want to delete, and then select **Delete This Version**. Also, you can't delete a blueprint until you've deleted all blueprint assignments of that blueprint definition.
