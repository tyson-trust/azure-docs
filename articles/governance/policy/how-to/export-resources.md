# Export Azure Policy resources

This article provides information on how to export your existing Azure Policy resources. Exporting
your resources is useful and recommended for backup, but is also an important step in your journey
with Cloud Governance and treating your [policy-as-code](../concepts/policy-as-code.md). Azure
Policy resources can be exported through [REST API](/rest/api/policy), [Azure CLI](#export-with-azure-cli), and [Azure PowerShell](#export-with-azure-powershell).

> [!NOTE]
> The portal experience for exporting definitions to GitHub was deprecated in April 2023. 

## Export with Azure CLI

Azure Policy definitions, initiatives, and assignments can each be exported as JSON with
[Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Each of these commands uses a **name** parameter to
specify which object to get the JSON for. The **name** property is often a _GUID_ and isn't the
**displayName** of the object.

- Definition - [az policy definition show](/cli/azure/policy/definition#az-policy-definition-show)
- Initiative - [az policy set-definition show](/cli/azure/policy/set-definition#az-policy-set-definition-show)
- Assignment - [az policy assignment show](/cli/azure/policy/assignment#az-policy-assignment-show)

Here is an example of getting the JSON for a policy definition with **name** of
_VirtualMachineStorage_:

```azurecli-interactive
az policy definition show --name 'VirtualMachineStorage'
```

## Export with Azure PowerShell

Azure Policy definitions, initiatives, and assignments can each be exported as JSON with [Azure
PowerShell](/powershell/azure/). Each of these cmdlets uses a **Name** parameter to specify which
object to get the JSON for. The **Name** property is often a _GUID_ (Globally Unique Identifier) and isn't the **displayName** of
the object.

- Definition - [Get-AzPolicyDefinition](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azpolicydefinition)
- Initiative - [Get-AzPolicySetDefinition](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azpolicysetdefinition)
- Assignment - [Get-AzPolicyAssignment](/powershell/module/az.resources/get-azpolicyassignment)

Here is an example of getting the JSON for a policy definition with **Name** (as mentioned previously, GUID) of
_d7fff7ea-9d47-4952-b854-b7da261e48f2_:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzPolicyDefinition -Name 'd7fff7ea-9d47-4952-b854-b7da261e48f2' | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```
