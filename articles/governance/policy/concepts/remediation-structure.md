# Azure Policy remediation task structure

The Azure Policy remediation task feature is used to bring resources into compliance established from a definition and assignment. Resources that are non-compliant to a [modify](./effects.md#modify) or [deployIfNotExist](./effects.md#deployifnotexists) definition assignment, can be brought into compliance using a remediation task. Remediation task deploys the deployIFNotExist template or the modify operations to the selected non-compliant resources using the identity specified in the assignment. See  [policy assignment structure](./assignment-structure.md#identity). to understand how the identity is define and [remediate non-compliant resources tutorial](../how-to/remediate-resources.md#configure-the-managed-identity) to configure the identity.

> [!NOTE]
> Remediation tasks remediate exisiting resources that are not compliant. Resources that are newly created or updated that are applicable to a deployIfNotExist or modify definition assignment are automatically remediated. 

You use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to create a policy remediation task. The policy remediation task contains elements for:

- [display name](#display-name-and-description)
- [description](#display-name-and-description)
- [policy assignment](#policy-assignment-id)
- [policy definitions within an initiative](#policy-definition-id)
- [resource count and parallel deployments](#resource-count-and-parallel-deployments)
- [failure threshold](#failure-threshold)
- [remediation filters](#remediation-filters)
- [resource discovery mode](#resource-discovery-mode)
- [provisioning state and deployment summary](#provisioning-state-and-deployment-summary)


For example, the following JSON shows a policy remediation task for policy definition named `requiredTags` a part of
an initiative assignment named `resourceShouldBeCompliantInit` with all default settings. 

```json
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/ExemptRG/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations/remediateNotCompliant",
    "apiVersion": "2021-10-01",
    "name": "remediateNotCompliant",
    "type": "Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations",
    "properties": {
        "policyAssignmentId": "/subscriptions/{mySubscriptionID}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/resourceShouldBeCompliantInit",
        "policyDefinitionReferenceIds":  "requiredTags",
        "resourceCount": 42,
        "parallelDeployments": 6,
        "failureThreshold": {
            "percentage": 0.1
        }
    }
}
```

## Display name and description

You use **displayName** and **description** to identify the policy remediation task and provide context for
its use. **displayName** has a maximum length of _128_ characters and
**description** a maximum length of _512_ characters. 

## Policy assignment ID

This field must be the full path name of either a policy assignment or an initiative assignment.
`policyAssignmentId` is a string and not an array. This property defines which assignment the parent
resource hierarchy or individual resource to remediate.

## Policy definition ID

If the `policyAssignmentId` is for an initiative assignment, the **policyDefinitionReferenceId** property must be used to specify which policy definition(s) in the initiative the subject resource(s) are to be remediated. As a remediation can only remediation in a scope of one definition,
this property is a _string_. The value must match the value in the initiative definition in the
`policyDefinitions.policyDefinitionReferenceId` field.

## Resource count and parallel deployments

Use **resource count** to  determine how many non-compliant resources to remediate in a given remediation task. The default value is 500, with the maximum number being 50,000. **Parallel deployments**  determines how many of those resources to remediate at the same time. The allowed range is between 1 to 30 with the default value being 10.  

> [!NOTE]
> Parallel deployments are the number of deployments within a singular remediation task with a maxmimum of 30. 100 remediation tasks can be ran simultaneously in the tenant.   

## Failure threshold

An optional property used to specify whether the remediation task should fail if the percentage of failures exceeds the given threshold. The **failure threshold** is represented as a percentage number from 0 to 100. By default, the failure threshold is 100%, meaning that the remediation task will continue to remediate other resources even if resources fail to remediate. 

## Remediation filters 

An optional property refines what resources are applicable to the remediation task. The allowed filter is resource location. Unless specified, resources from any region can be remediated. 

## Resource discovery mode

This property decides how to discover resources that are eligible for remediation. For a resource to be eligible, it must be non-compliant. By default, this property is set to `ExistingNonCompliant`. It could also be set to `ReEvaluateCompliance`, which will trigger a new compliance scan for that assignment and remediate any resources that are found non-compliant.  

## Provisioning state and deployment summary

Once a remediation task is created, **provisioning state** and **deployment summary** properties are populated. **Provisioning state** indicates the status of the remediation task. Allow values are `Running`, `Canceled`, `Cancelling`, `Failed`, `Complete`, or `Succeeded`. **Deployment summary** is an array property indicating the number of deployments along with number of successful and failed deployments. 

Sample of remediation task that completed successfully: 

```json
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/{subId}/resourceGroups/ExemptRG/providers/Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations/remediateNotCompliant",
    "Type":  "Microsoft.PolicyInsights/remediations",
    "Name":  "remediateNotCompliant",
    "PolicyAssignmentId":  "/subscriptions/{mySubscriptionID}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/resourceShouldBeCompliantInit",
    "policyDefinitionReferenceIds":  "requiredTags",
    "resourceCount": 42,
    "parallelDeployments": 6,
    "failureThreshold": {
        "percentage": 0.1
    },
    "ProvisioningState":  "Succeeded",
    "DeploymentSummary":  {
        "TotalDeployments":  42,
        "SuccessfulDeployments":  42,
        "FailedDeployments":  0
    },
}
```
