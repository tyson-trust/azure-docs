# Resize a lab VM in Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs supports changing the size of a lab virtual machine (VM), based on changing needs for CPU, network, or disk performance. This article describes how to resize a lab VM.

> [!NOTE]
> The resize feature complies with lab policy for [allowed VM sizes](devtest-lab-set-lab-policy.md#set-allowed-virtual-machine-sizes). You can resize a VM only to sizes that lab policy allows.

## Stop the VM

To avoid losing work, disconnect from and stop the VM before resizing it.

1. If you're connected to the VM through secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop session (RDP), save your work and disconnect from the VM.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040), on your lab's **Overview** page, select the VM you want to resize from the list under **My virtual machines**.

1. On the VM's **Overview** page, select **Stop** on the toolbar.

Once the VM stops, or if the VM is already stopped, **Stop** is grayed out.

## Resize the VM

1. On the VM's **Overview** page, select **Size** under **Settings** in the left navigation.

   You can check the status of the resize operation in the **Notifications** window.

1. When the resize finishes, start the VM by selecting **Start** from the VM's **Overview** page toolbar.
