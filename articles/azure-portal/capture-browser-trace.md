# Capture a browser trace for troubleshooting

If you're troubleshooting an issue with the Azure portal, and you need to contact Microsoft support, you may want to first capture some additional information. For example, it can be helpful to share a browser trace, a step recording, and console output. This information can provide important details about what exactly is happening in the portal when your issue occurs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft support uses these traces for troubleshooting purposes only. Please be mindful who you share your traces with, as they may contain sensitive information about your environment.

You can capture this information any [supported browser](azure-portal-supported-browsers-devices.md): Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Safari (on Mac), or Firefox. Steps for each browser are shown below.

## Microsoft Edge

The following steps show how to use the developer tools in Microsoft Edge. For more information, see [Microsoft Edge DevTools](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium).

> [!NOTE]
> The screenshots below show the DevTools in Focus Mode with a vertical **Activity Bar**. Depending on your settings, your configuration may look different. For more information, see [Simplify DevTools using Focus Mode](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/experimental-features/focus-mode).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). It's important to sign in _before_ you start the trace so that the trace doesn't contain sensitive information related to your account.

1. Start recording the steps you take in the portal, using [Steps Recorder](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/record-steps-to-reproduce-a-problem-46582a9b-620f-2e36-00c9-04e25d784e47).

1. In the portal, navigate to the step prior to where the issue occurs.

1. Press F12 to launch Microsoft Edge DevTools. You can also launch the tools from the toolbar menu under **More tools** > **Developer tools**.

1. By default, the browser keeps trace information only for the page that's currently loaded. Set the following options so the browser keeps all trace information, even if your repro steps require going to more than one page.

    1. Select the **Console** tab, select **Console settings**, then select **Preserve Log**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/edge-console-preserve-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the Preserve log option on the Console tab in Edge.":::

    1. Select the **Network** tab. If that tab isn't visible, click the **More tools** (+) button and select **Network**. Then, from the **Network** tab, select **Preserve log**.

       :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/edge-network-preserve-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the Preserve log option on the Network tab in Edge.":::

1. On the **Network** tab, select **Stop recording network log** and **Clear**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/edge-start-session.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to record the network log in Edge.":::

   You'll see session output similar to the following image.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/edge-browser-trace-results.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing session output in Edge.":::

1. After you have reproduced the unexpected portal behavior, select **Stop recording network log**, then select **Export HAR** and save the file.

   :::image type="content" source="media/capture-browser-trace/edge-network-export-har.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to Export HAR on the Network tab in Edge.":::
