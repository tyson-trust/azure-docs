## Get started

Azure Quickstart Center has two options in the **Get started** tab:

* **Start a project**: If you're ready to create a resource, this section lets you learn more about your choices before you commit to a service option. You'll discover more about the service and why you should use it, explore costs, and identify prerequisites. After making your choice, you can go directly to create.

* **Setup guides**: Designed for the IT admin and cloud architect, our guides introduce key concepts for Azure adoption. Structured steps help you take action as you learn, applying Microsoft's recommended best practices. The migration guide helps you assess readiness and plan as you prepare to shift to Azure.
