# Discover Azure resources to manage in Privileged Identity Management

You can use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra, to improve the protection of your Azure resources. This helps:

- Organizations that already use Privileged Identity Management to protect Azure AD roles
- Management group and subscription owners who are trying to secure production resources

When you first set up Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources, you need to discover and select the resources you want to protect with Privileged Identity Management. When you discover resources through Privileged Identity Management, PIM creates the PIM service principal (MS-PIM) assigned as User Access Administrator on the resource. There's no limit to the number of resources that you can manage with Privileged Identity Management. However, we recommend starting with your most critical production resources.

## Required permissions

You can view and manage the management groups or subscriptions to which you have Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permissions, such as User Access Administrator or Owner roles. If you are not a subscription owner, but are a Global Administrator and don't see any Azure subscriptions or management groups to manage, then you can [elevate access to manage your resources](../../role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin.md).

## Discover resources

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

    If this is your first time using Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources, you'll see a **Discover resources** page.

    If another administrator in your organization is already managing Azure resources in Privileged Identity Management, you'll see a list of the resources that are currently being managed.

    ![Discover resources pane listing resources that are currently being managed](./media/pim-resource-roles-discover-resources/discover-resources.png)

1. Select **Discover resources** to launch the discovery experience.

1. On the **Discovery** page, use **Resource state filter** and **Select resource type** to filter the management groups or subscriptions you have write permission to. It's probably easiest to start with **All** initially.

   You can search for and select management group or subscription resources to manage in Privileged Identity Management. When you manage a management group or a subscription in Privileged Identity Management, you can also manage its child resources.

   > [!Note]
   > When you add a new child Azure resource to a PIM-managed management group, you can bring the child resource under management by searching for it in PIM.

1. Select any unmanaged resources that you want to manage.

1. Select **Manage resource** to start managing the selected resources. The PIM service principal (MS-PIM) is 
assigned as User Access Administrator on the resource.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Once a management group or subscription is managed, it can't be unmanaged. This prevents another resource administrator from removing Privileged Identity Management settings.

1. If you see a message to confirm the onboarding of the selected resource for management, select **Yes**. PIM will then be configured to manage all the new and existing child objects under the resource(s).
