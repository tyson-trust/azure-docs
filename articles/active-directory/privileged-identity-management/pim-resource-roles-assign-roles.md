# Assign Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management

With Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (Azure AD PIM), part of Microsoft Entra, you can manage the built-in Azure resource roles, and custom roles, including (but not limited to):

- Owner
- User Access Administrator
- Contributor
- Security Admin
- Security Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Users or members of a group assigned to the Owner or User Access Administrator subscription roles, and Azure AD Global administrators that enable subscription management in Azure AD have Resource administrator permissions by default. These administrators can assign roles, configure role settings, and review access using Privileged Identity Management for Azure resources. A user can't manage Privileged Identity Management for Resources without Resource administrator permissions. View the list of [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

Privileged Identity Management support both built-in and custom Azure roles. For more information on Azure custom roles, see [Azure custom roles](../../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md).

## Role assignment conditions

You can use the Azure attribute-based access control (Azure ABAC) to add conditions on eligible role assignments using Azure AD PIM for Azure resources. With Azure AD PIM, your end users must activate an eligible role assignment to get permission to perform certain actions. Using conditions in Azure AD PIM enables you not only to limit a user's role permissions to a resource using fine-grained conditions, but also to use Azure AD PIM to secure the role assignment with a time-bound setting, approval workflow, audit trail, and so on.

>[!Note]
>When a role is assigned, the assignment:
>- Can't be assigned for a duration of less than five minutes
>- Can't be removed within five minutes of it being assigned

Currently, the following built-in roles can have conditions added:

- [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-contributor)
- [Storage Blob Data Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-owner)
- [Storage Blob Data Reader](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader)

For more information, see [What is Azure attribute-based access control (Azure ABAC)](../../role-based-access-control/conditions-overview.md).

## Assign a role

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

Follow these steps to make a user eligible for an Azure resource role.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with Owner or User Access Administrator role permissions.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

1. Select the **Resource type** you want to manage. For example, such as **Resource**, or **Resource group**.  Then select the resource you want to manage to open its overview page.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to select Azure resources.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-list.png)

1. Under **Manage**, select **Roles** to see the list of roles for Azure resources.

1. Select **Add assignments** to open the **Add assignments** pane.

    ![Screenshot of Azure resources roles.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-roles.png)

1. Select a **Role** you want to assign.
1. Select **No member selected** link to open the **Select a member or group** pane.

    ![Screenshot of the new assignment pane.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-select-role.png)

1. Select a member or group you want to assign to the role and then choose **Select**.

    ![Screenshots that demonstrates how to select a member or group pane](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-select-member-or-group.png)

1. On the **Settings** tab, in the **Assignment type** list, select **Eligible** or **Active**.

    ![Screenshot of add assignments settings pane.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-membership-settings-type.png)

    Azure AD PIM for Azure resources provides two distinct assignment types:

    - **Eligible** assignments require the member to activate the role before using it. Administrator may require role member to perform certain actions before role activation which might include performing a multi-factor authentication (MFA) check, providing a business justification, or requesting approval from designated approvers.

    - **Active** assignments don't require the member to activate the role before usage. Members assigned as active have the privileges assigned ready to use. This type of assignment is also available to customers that don't use Azure AD PIM.

1. To specify a specific assignment duration, change the start and end dates and times.

1. If the role has been defined with actions that permit assignments to that role with conditions, then you can select **Add condition** to add a condition based on the principal user and resource attributes that are part of the assignment.

    ![Screenshot of the new assignment conditions pane.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/new-assignment-conditions.png)
    
    Conditions can be entered in the expression builder. 

    ![Screenshot of the new assignment condition built from an expression.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/new-assignment-condition-expression.png)

1. When finished, select **Assign**.

1. After the new role assignment is created, a status notification is displayed.

    ![Screenshot of a new assignment notification.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-new-assignment-notification.png)

## Assign a role using ARM API

Privileged Identity Management supports Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API commands to manage Azure resource roles, as documented in the [PIM ARM API reference](/rest/api/authorization/roleeligibilityschedulerequests). For the permissions required to use the PIM API, see [Understand the Privileged Identity Management APIs](pim-apis.md).

The following example is a sample HTTP request to create an eligible assignment for an Azure role.

## Update or remove an existing role assignment

Follow these steps to update or remove an existing role assignment.

1. Open **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Select **Azure resources**.

1. Select the **Resource type** you want to manage. For example, such as **Resource**, or **Resource group**.  Then select the resource you want to manage to open its overview page.

    ![Screenshot that shows how to select Azure resources to update.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-list.png)

1. Under **Manage**, select **Roles** to list the roles for Azure resources. The following screenshot lists the roles of an Azure Storage account. Select the role that you want to update or remove.

    ![Screenshot that shows the roles of an Azure Storage account.](./media/pim-resource-roles-assign-roles/resources-update-select-role.png)

1. Find the role assignment on the **Eligible roles** or **Active roles** tabs.

1. To add or update a condition to refine Azure resource access, select **Add** or **View/Edit** in the **Condition** column for the role assignment. Currently, the Storage Blob Data Owner, Storage Blob Data Reader, and Storage Blob Data Contributor roles in Azure AD PIM are the only roles that can have conditions added.

1. Select **Add expression** or **Delete** to update the expression. You can also select **Add condition** to add a new condition to your role.
