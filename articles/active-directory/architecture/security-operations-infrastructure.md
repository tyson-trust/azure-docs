# Security operations for infrastructure

Infrastructure has many components where vulnerabilities can occur if not properly configured. As part of your monitoring and alerting strategy for infrastructure, monitor and alert events in the following areas:

* Authentication and Authorization

* Hybrid Authentication components incl. Federation Servers

* Policies

* Subscriptions

Monitoring and alerting the components of your authentication infrastructure is critical. Any compromise can lead to a full compromise of the whole environment. Many enterprises that use Azure AD operate in a hybrid authentication environment. Cloud and on-premises components should be included in your monitoring and alerting strategy. Having a hybrid authentication environment also introduces another attack vector to your environment.

We recommend all the components be considered Control Plane / Tier 0 assets, and the accounts used to manage them. Refer to [Securing privileged assets](/security/compass/overview) (SPA) for guidance on designing and implementing your environment. This guidance includes recommendations for each of the hybrid authentication components that could potentially be used for an Azure AD tenant.

A first step in being able to detect unexpected events and potential attacks is to establish a baseline. For all on-premises components listed in this article, see [Privileged access deployment](/security/compass/privileged-access-deployment), which is part of the Securing privileged assets (SPA) guide.

## Where to look

The log files you use for investigation and monitoring are:

* [Azure AD Audit logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md)

* [Sign-in logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins.md)

* [Microsoft 365 Audit logs](/microsoft-365/compliance/auditing-solutions-overview)

* [Azure Key Vault logs](../../key-vault/general/logging.md?tabs=Vault)

From the Azure portal, you can view the Azure AD Audit logs and download as comma separated value (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. The Azure portal has several ways to integrate Azure AD logs with other tools that allow for greater automation of monitoring and alerting:

* **[Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentinel/overview.md)** – Enables intelligent security analytics at the enterprise level by providing security information and event management (SIEM) capabilities.

* **[Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/cloud/azure)** - Sigma is an evolving open standard for writing rules and templates that automated management tools can use to parse log files. Where Sigma templates exist for our recommended search criteria, we've added a link to the Sigma repo. The Sigma templates aren't written, tested, and managed by Microsoft. Rather, the repo and templates are created and collected by the worldwide IT security community.

* **[Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md)** – Enables automated monitoring and alerting of various conditions. Can create or use workbooks to combine data from different sources.

* **[Azure Event Hubs](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md)** integrated with a SIEM - [Azure AD logs can be integrated to other SIEMs](../reports-monitoring/tutorial-azure-monitor-stream-logs-to-event-hub.md) such as Splunk, ArcSight, QRadar and Sumo Logic via the Azure Event Hubs integration.

* **[Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security)** – Enables you to discover and manage apps, govern across apps and resources, and check your cloud apps’ compliance.

* **[Securing workload identities with Identity Protection Preview](..//identity-protection/concept-workload-identity-risk.md)** - Used to detect risk on workload identities across sign-in behavior and offline indicators of compromise.

The remainder of this article describes what to monitor and alert on. It is organized by the type of threat. Where there are pre-built solutions, you'll find links to them, after the table. Otherwise, you can build alerts using the preceding tools.

## Authentication infrastructure

In hybrid environments that contain both on-premises and cloud-based resources and accounts, the Active Directory infrastructure is a key part of the authentication stack. The stack is also a target for attacks so must be configured to maintain a secure environment and must be monitored properly. Examples of current types of attacks used against your authentication infrastructure use Password Spray and Solorigate techniques. The following are links to articles we recommend:

* [Securing privileged access overview](/security/compass/overview) – This article provides an overview of current techniques using Zero Trust techniques to create and maintain secure privileged access.

* [Microsoft Defender for Identity monitored domain activities](/defender-for-identity/monitored-activities) - This article provides a comprehensive list of activities to monitor and set alerts for.

* [Microsoft Defender for Identity security alert tutorial](/defender-for-identity/understanding-security-alerts) - This article provides guidance on creating and implementing a security alert strategy.

The following are links to specific articles that focus on monitoring and alerting your authentication infrastructure:

* [Understand and use Lateral Movement Paths with Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/use-case-lateral-movement-path) - Detection techniques to help identify when non-sensitive accounts are used to gain access to sensitive network accounts.

* [Working with security alerts in Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/working-with-suspicious-activities) - This article describes how to review and manage alerts after they're logged.

 The following are specific things to look for:

### Pass-through authentication monitoring

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Pass-through Authentication signs users in by validating their passwords directly against on-premises Active Directory.

The following are specific things to look for:

| What to monitor| Risk level| Where| Filter/sub-filter| Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Azure AD pass-through authentication errors|Medium | Application and Service Logs\Microsoft\AzureAdConnect\AuthenticationAgent\Admin| AADSTS80001 – Unable to connect to Active Directory| Ensure that agent servers are members of the same AD forest as the users whose passwords need to be validated and they can connect to Active Directory. |
| Azure AD pass-through authentication errors| Medium| Application and Service Logs\Microsoft\AzureAdConnect\AuthenticationAgent\Admin| AADSTS8002 - A timeout occurred connecting to Active Directory| Check to ensure that Active Directory is available and is responding to requests from the agents. |

## Monitoring for creation of new Azure AD tenants

Organizations might need to monitor for and alert on the creation of new Azure AD tenants when the action is initiated by identities from their organizational tenant. Monitoring for this scenario provides visibility on how many tenants are being created and could be accessed by end users.

| What to monitor| Risk level| Where| Filter/sub-filter| Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Creation of a new Azure AD tenant, using an identity from your tenant. | Medium | Azure AD Audit logs | Category: Directory Management<br><br>Activity: Create Company | Target(s) shows the created TenantID |

### AppProxy Connector

Azure AD and Azure AD Application Proxy give remote users a single sign-on (SSO) experience. Users securely connect to on-premises apps without a virtual private network (VPN) or dual-homed servers and firewall rules. If your Azure AD Application Proxy connector server is compromised, attackers could alter the SSO experience or change access to published applications.

To configure monitoring for Application Proxy, see [Troubleshoot Application Proxy problems and error messages](../app-proxy/application-proxy-troubleshoot.md). The data file that logs information can be found in Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\AadApplicationProxy\Connector\Admin. For a complete reference guide to audit activity, see [Azure AD audit activity reference](../reports-monitoring/reference-audit-activities.md). Specific things to monitor:

| What to monitor| Risk level| Where| Filter/sub-filter| Notes |

| Pass-the-ticket like attacks| High| | | Follow guidance in:<br>[Security principal reconnaissance (LDAP) (external ID 2038)](/defender-for-identity/reconnaissance-alerts)<br>[Tutorial: Compromised credential alerts](/defender-for-identity/compromised-credentials-alerts)<br>[Understand and use Lateral Movement Paths with Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/use-case-lateral-movement-path)<br>[Understanding entity profiles](/defender-for-identity/entity-profiles) |

### Legacy authentication settings

For multifactor authentication (MFA) to be effective, you also need to block legacy authentication. You then need to monitor your environment and alert on any use of legacy authentication. Legacy authentication protocols like POP, SMTP, IMAP, and MAPI can’t enforce MFA. This makes these protocols the preferred entry points for attackers. For more information on tools that you can use to block legacy authentication, see [New tools to block legacy authentication in your organization](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/new-tools-to-block-legacy-authentication-in-your-organization/ba-p/1225302).

Legacy authentication is captured in the Azure AD Sign-ins log as part of the detail of the event. You can use the Azure Monitor workbook to help with identifying legacy authentication usage. For more information, see [Sign-ins using legacy authentication](../reports-monitoring/howto-use-azure-monitor-workbooks.md), which is part of [How to use Azure Monitor Workbooks for Azure Active Directory reports](../reports-monitoring/howto-use-azure-monitor-workbooks.md). You can also use the Insecure protocols workbook for Microsoft Sentinel. For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel Insecure Protocols Workbook Implementation Guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-sentinel/azure-sentinel-insecure-protocols-workbook-implementation-guide/ba-p/1197564). Specific activities to monitor include:

| What to monitor| Risk level| Where| Filter/sub-filter| Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Legacy authentications|High | Azure AD Sign-ins log| ClientApp : POP<br>ClientApp : IMAP<br>ClientApp : MAPI<br>ClientApp: SMTP<br>ClientApp : ActiveSync go to EXO<br>Other Clients = SharePoint and EWS| In federated domain environments, failed authentications aren't recorded and don't appear in the log. |

## Azure AD Connect

Azure AD Connect provides a centralized location that enables account and attribute synchronization between your on-premises and cloud-based Azure AD environment. Azure AD Connect is the Microsoft tool designed to meet and accomplish your hybrid identity goals. It provides the following features:

* [Password hash synchronization](../hybrid/connect/whatis-phs.md) - A sign-in method that synchronizes a hash of a user’s on-premises AD password with Azure AD.

* [Synchronization](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sync-whatis.md) - Responsible for creating users, groups, and other objects. And, making sure identity information for your on-premises users and groups matches the cloud. This synchronization also includes password hashes.

* [Health Monitoring](../hybrid/connect/whatis-azure-ad-connect.md) - Azure AD Connect Health can provide robust monitoring and provide a central location in the Azure portal to view this activity.

Synchronizing identity between your on-premises environment and your cloud environment introduces a new attack surface for your on-premises and cloud-based environment. We recommend:

* You treat your Azure AD Connect primary and staging servers as Tier 0 Systems in your control plane.

* You follow a standard set of policies that govern each type of account and its usage in your environment.

* You install Azure AD Connect and Connect Health. These primarily provide operational data for the environment.

Logging of Azure AD Connect operations occurs in different ways:

* The Azure AD Connect wizard logs data to \ProgramData\AADConnect . Each time the wizard is invoked, a timestamped trace log file is created. The trace log can be imported into Sentinel or other 3<sup data-htmlnode="">rd</sup> party security information and event management (SIEM) tools for analysis.

* Some operations initiate a PowerShell script to capture logging information. To collect this data, you must make sure script block logging in enabled.

### Monitoring configuration changes

Azure AD uses Microsoft SQL Server Data Engine or SQL to store Azure AD Connect configuration information. Therefore, monitoring and auditing of the log files associated with configuration should be included in your monitoring and auditing strategy. Specifically, include the following tables in your monitoring and alerting strategy.

| What to monitor| Where| Notes |
| - | - | - |
| mms_management_agent| SQL service audit records| See [SQL Server Audit Records](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records) |
| mms_partition| SQL service audit records| See [SQL Server Audit Records](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records) |
| mms_run_profile| SQL service audit records| See [SQL Server Audit Records](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records) |
| mms_server_configuration| SQL service audit records| See [SQL Server Audit Records](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records) |
| mms_synchronization_rule| SQL service audit records| See [SQL Server Audit Records](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records) |

For information on what and how to monitor configuration information refer to:

* For SQL server, see [SQL Server Audit Records](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records).

* For Microsoft Sentinel, see [Connect to Windows servers to collect security events](/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-records).

* For information on configuring and using Azure AD Connect, see [What is Azure AD Connect?](../hybrid/connect/whatis-azure-ad-connect.md)

### Monitoring and troubleshooting synchronization

 One function of Azure AD Connect is to synchronize hash synchronization between a user’s on-premises password and Azure AD. If passwords aren't synchronizing as expected, the synchronization might affect a subset of users or all users. Use the following to help verify proper operation or troubleshoot issues:

* Information for checking and troubleshooting hash synchronization, see [Troubleshoot password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](../hybrid/connect/tshoot-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md).

* Modifications to the connector spaces, see [Troubleshoot Azure AD Connect objects and attributes](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/troubleshoot-aad-connect-objects-attributes).

**Important resources on monitoring**

| What to monitor | Resources |
| - | - |
| Hash synchronization validation|See [Troubleshoot password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](../hybrid/connect/tshoot-connect-password-hash-synchronization.md) |
 Modifications to the connector spaces|see [Troubleshoot Azure AD Connect objects and attributes](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/troubleshoot-aad-connect-objects-attributes) |
| Modifications to rules you configured| Monitor changes to: filtering, domain and OU, attribute, and group-based changes |
| SQL and MSDE changes | Changes to logging parameters and addition of custom functions |

**Monitor the following**:

| What to monitor| Risk level| Where| Filter/sub-filter| Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Scheduler changes|High | PowerShell| Set-ADSyncScheduler| Look for modifications to schedule |
| Changes to scheduled tasks| High | Azure AD Audit logs| Activity = 4699(S): A scheduled task was deleted<br>-or-<br>Activity = 4701(s): A scheduled task was disabled<br>-or-<br>Activity = 4702(s): A scheduled task was updated| Monitor all |

### Monitoring seamless single sign-on

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Seamless Single Sign-On (Seamless SSO) automatically signs in users when they are on their corporate desktops that are connected to your corporate network. Seamless SSO provides your users with easy access to your cloud-based applications without other on-premises components. SSO uses the pass-through authentication and password hash synchronization capabilities provided by Azure AD Connect.

Monitoring single sign-on and Kerberos activity can help you detect general credential theft attack patterns. Monitor using the following information:

| What to monitor| Risk level| Where| Filter/sub-filter| Notes |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Errors associated with SSO and Kerberos validation failures|Medium | Azure AD Sign-ins log| | Single sign-on list of error codes at [Single sign-on](../hybrid/connect/tshoot-connect-sso.md). |
| Query for troubleshooting errors|Medium | PowerShell| See query following table. check in each forest with SSO enabled.| Check in each forest with SSO enabled. |

```

## Password protection policies

If you deploy Azure AD Password Protection, monitoring and reporting are essential tasks. The following links provide details to help you understand various monitoring techniques, including where each service logs information and how to report on the use of Azure AD Password Protection.

The domain controller (DC) agent and proxy services both log event log messages. All PowerShell cmdlets described below are only available on the proxy server (see the AzureADPasswordProtection PowerShell module). The DC agent software doesn't install a PowerShell module.

Detailed information for planning and implementing on-premises password protection is available at [Plan and deploy on-premises Azure Active Directory Password Protection](../authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-deploy.md). For monitoring details, see [Monitor on-premises Azure AD Password Protection](../authentication/howto-password-ban-bad-on-premises-monitor.md). On each domain controller, the DC agent service software writes the results of each individual password validation operation (and other status) to the following local event log:

* \Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\AzureADPasswordProtection\DCAgent\Admin

* \Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\AzureADPasswordProtection\DCAgent\Operational

* \Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\AzureADPasswordProtection\DCAgent\Trace

The DC agent Admin log is the primary source of information for how the software is behaving. By default, the Trace log is off and must be enabled before data is logged. To troubleshoot application proxy problems and error messages, detailed information is available at [Troubleshoot Azure Active Directory Application Proxy](../app-proxy/application-proxy-troubleshoot.md). Information for these events is logged in:

* Applications and Services Logs\Microsoft\AadApplicationProxy\Connector\Admin

* Azure AD Audit Log, Category Application Proxy

Complete reference for Azure AD audit activities is available at [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) audit activity reference](../reports-monitoring/reference-audit-activities.md).

## Conditional Access
In Azure AD, you can protect access to your resources by configuring Conditional Access policies. As an IT administrator, you want to ensure your Conditional Access policies work as expected to ensure that your resources are protected. Monitoring and alerting on changes to the Conditional Access service ensures policies defined by your organization for access to data are enforced. Azure AD logs when changes are made to Conditional Access and also provides workbooks to ensure your policies are providing the expected coverage.

**Workbook Links**

* [Conditional Access insights and reporting](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md)

* [Conditional Access gap analysis workbook](../reports-monitoring/workbook-conditional-access-gap-analyzer.md)
