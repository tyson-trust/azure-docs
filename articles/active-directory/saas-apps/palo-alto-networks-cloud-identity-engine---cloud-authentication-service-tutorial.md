# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service from the gallery

To configure the integration of Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service into Azure AD, you need to add Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service** in the search box.
1. Select **Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service SSO](#configure-palo-alto-networks-cloud-identity-engine---cloud-authentication-service-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service test user](#create-palo-alto-networks-cloud-identity-engine---cloud-authentication-service-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file**, perform the following steps:

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

    ![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** value gets auto populated in Basic SAML Configuration section.

	d. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<RegionUrl>.paloaltonetworks.com/sp/acs`

	> [!Note]
	> If the **Identifier** value does not get auto populated, then please fill in the value manually according to your requirement. The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service Client support team](mailto:support@paloaltonetworks.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, Palo Alto Networks Cloud Identity Engine - Cloud Authentication Service application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------- |
	| Group |  user.groups |
	| username | user.userprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.
