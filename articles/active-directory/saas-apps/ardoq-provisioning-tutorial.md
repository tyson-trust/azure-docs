# Tutorial: Configure Ardoq for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Ardoq and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users to [Ardoq](https://www.ardoq.com) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Supported capabilities
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Ardoq.
> * Remove users in Ardoq when they do not require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Ardoq.
> * [Single sign-on](ardoq-tutorial.md) to Ardoq (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator).
* An administrator account with Ardoq.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Ardoq](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md).

## Step 2. Configure Ardoq to support provisioning with Azure AD
* Provisioning is gated by a feature toggle in Ardoq.  If you intend to configure SSO or have already done so, Ardoq will automatically recognize that Azure AD is in use, and the provisioning feature will be automatically enabled.

* If you don't intend to use the provisioning features of Azure AD along with SSO, please reach out to Ardoq customer support and they'll manually enable support for provisioning.

Before we proceed we need to obtain a *Tenant Url* and a *Secret Token*, to configure secure communication between Azure AD and Ardoq.




1. Log in to Ardoq admin console. 
1. In the left menu click on profile logo and, navigate to **Organization Settings->Manage Organization->Manage SCIM Token**.
1. Click on **Generate new**.
1. Copy and save the **Token**.This value will be entered in the **Secret Token** field in the Provisioning tab of your Ardoq application in the Azure portal. 
1. To create your *tenant URL*, use this template: `https://<YOUR-SUBDOMAIN>.ardoq.com/api/scim/v2` by replacing the placeholder text `<YOUR-SUBDOMAIN>`.This value will be entered in the **Tenant Url** field in the Provisioning tab of your Ardoq application in the Azure portal.

	>[!NOTE]
	>`<YOUR-SUBDOMAIN>` is the subdomain your organization has chosen to access Ardoq. This is the same URL segment you use when you access the Ardoq app. For example, if your organization accesses Ardoq at `https://acme.ardoq.com` you'd fill in `acme`.  If you're in the US and access Ardoq at `https://piedpiper.us.ardoq.com`  then you'd fill in `piedpiper.us`.

## Step 3. Add Ardoq from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Ardoq from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Ardoq. If you have previously setup Ardoq for SSO you can use the same application. However it's recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users, you can control this by assigning one or two users to the app. When scope is set to all users, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need more roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Ardoq 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Ardoq in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Screenshot of Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Ardoq**.

	![Screenshot of the Ardoq link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Ardoq Tenant URL and Secret Token. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Ardoq. If the connection fails, ensure your Ardoq account has Admin permissions and try again.

 	![Screenshot of Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Ardoq**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Ardoq in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Ardoq for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you'll need to ensure that the Ardoq API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Ardoq|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean||&check;
   |displayName|String||&check;
   |roles[primary eq "True"].value|String||&check;
   
1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Ardoq, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to Ardoq by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application goes into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).
