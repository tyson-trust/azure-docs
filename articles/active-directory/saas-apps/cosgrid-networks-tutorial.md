# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Cosgrid Networks

In this article, you learn how to integrate Cosgrid Networks with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Cosgrid Networks offers secure and efficient enterprise connections through SD-WAN and SASE solutions. Our flexible architecture transforms your network infrastructure for seamless operations. When you integrate Cosgrid Networks with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Cosgrid Networks.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cosgrid Networks with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Cosgrid Networks in a test environment. Cosgrid Networks supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Cosgrid Networks, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cosgrid Networks single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Cosgrid Networks application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Cosgrid Networks from the Azure AD gallery

Add Cosgrid Networks from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Cosgrid Networks. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Cosgrid Networks** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://cosgridnetworks.in/api/v1/auth/acs/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://cosgridnetworks.in/api/v1/auth/acs/`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://www.cosgrid.net/auth/login`

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Cosgrid Networks SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cosgrid Networks** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Cosgrid Networks support team](mailto:contact@cosgrid.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cosgrid Networks test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Cosgrid Networks. Work with [Cosgrid Networks support team](mailto:contact@cosgrid.com) to add the users in the Cosgrid Networks platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Cosgrid Networks Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Cosgrid Networks Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Cosgrid Networks tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Cosgrid Networks Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

* [Plan a single sign-on deployment](../manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cosgrid Networks you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
