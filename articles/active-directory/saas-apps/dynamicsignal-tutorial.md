# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Dynamic Signal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Druva with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Druva with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Druva.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Druva with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Dynamic Signal, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Dynamic Signal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Dynamic Signal supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* Dynamic Signal supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

* Dynamic Signal supports [Automated user provisioning](dynamic-signal-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add Druva from the gallery

To configure the integration of Druva into Azure AD, you need to add Druva from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Druva** in the search box.
1. Select **Druva** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Druva

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Druva using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Druva.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Druva, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Dynamic SSO](#configure-dynamic-signal-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Dynamic Signal test user](#create-dynamic-signal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Dynamic Signal that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Dynamic Signal** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.voicestorm.com`

    b. In the **Identifier** box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.voicestorm.com`

    c. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.voicestorm.com/User/SsoResponse`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Dynamic Signal Client support team](mailto:support@dynamicsignal.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

6. On the **Set up Dynamic Signal** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Dynamic Signal.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Dynamic Signal**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Dynamic Signal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Dynamic Signal** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Dynamic Signal support team](mailto:support@dynamicsignal.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Dynamic Signal test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Dynamic Signal. Dynamic Signal supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Dynamic Signal, a new one is created after authentication.

Dynamic Signal also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./dynamic-signal-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

### Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal. This will redirect to Dynamic Signal Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to Dynamic Signal Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Dynamic Signal tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Dynamic Signal Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Dynamic Signal you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
