# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Envi MMIS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Envi MMIS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Envi MMIS with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Envi MMIS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Envi MMIS with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Envi MMIS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Envi MMIS supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Envi MMIS from the gallery

To configure the integration of Envi MMIS into Azure AD, you need to add Envi MMIS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Envi MMIS** in the search box.
1. Select **Envi MMIS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Envi MMIS

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Envi MMIS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Envi MMIS.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Envi MMIS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Envi MMIS SSO](#configure-envi-mmis-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Envi MMIS test user](#create-envi-mmis-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Envi MMIS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Envi MMIS** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.<CUSTOMER DOMAIN>.com/Account`

    1. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.<CUSTOMER DOMAIN>.com/Account/Acs`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.<CUSTOMER DOMAIN>.com/Account`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Envi MMIS Client support team](mailto:support@ioscorp.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set-up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

    1. Click **Save**.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Envi MMIS Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Envi MMIS Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Envi MMIS for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Envi MMIS tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Envi MMIS for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Envi MMIS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
