# Tutorial: Configure MURAL Identity for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both MURAL Identity and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [MURAL Identity](https://www.mural.co/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in MURAL Identity
> * Remove users in MURAL Identity when they do not require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and MURAL Identity
> * Provision groups and group memberships in MURAL Identity.
> * [Single sign-on](mural-identity-tutorial.md) to MURAL Identity (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md). 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* SCIM provisioning is only available for MURALâ€™s Enterprise plan. Before you configure SCIM provisioning, please reach out to a member of the MURAL Customer Success Team to enable the feature.
* SAML based SSO must be properly set up before configuring automated provisioning. The instructions on how to set up SSO through Azure Active Directory for MURAL can be found [here](mural-identity-tutorial.md).

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1.  Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and MURAL Identity](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure MURAL Identity to support provisioning with Azure AD

Follow the [steps](https://developers.mural.co/enterprise/docs/set-up-the-scim-api) to get your SCIM URL and unique API Token from the API keys page in your MURAL Company dashboard. Use this key in the Secret Token field in **Step 5**.

## Step 3. Add MURAL Identity from the Azure AD application gallery

Add MURAL Identity from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to MURAL Identity. If you have previously setup MURAL Identity for SSO you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to MURAL Identity 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in MURAL Identity based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for MURAL Identity in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **MURAL Identity**.

	![The MURAL Identity link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your MURAL Identity Tenant URL and Secret Token. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to MURAL Identity. If the connection fails, ensure your MURAL Identity account has Admin permissions and try again.

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to MURAL Identity**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to MURAL Identity in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in MURAL Identity for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the MURAL Identity API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by MURAL Identity
   |---|---|---|---
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String||&check;
   |active|Boolean||
   |name.givenName|String||
   |name.familyName|String||
   |externalId|String||

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to MURAL Identity**.

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to MURAL Identity in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in MURAL Identity for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by MURAL Identity|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |displayName|String|&check;|&check;
   |members|Reference||
   |externalId|String||
10. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

11. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for MURAL Identity, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

12. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to MURAL Identity by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

13. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).  

## Troubleshooting Tips
* When provisioning a user keep in mind that at MURAL we do not support numbers in the name fields (i.e. givenName or familyName).
* When filtering on **userName** in the GET endpoint make sure that the email address is all lowercase otherwise you will get an empty result. This is because we convert email addresses to lowercase while provisioning accounts.
* When de-provisioning an end-user (setting the active attribute to false), user will be soft-deleted and lose access to all their workspaces. When that same de-provisioned end-user is later activated again (setting the active attribute to true), user will not have access to the workspaces user previously belonged to. The end-user will see an error message "Youâ€™ve been deactivated from this workspace",  with an option to request reactivation which the workspace admin must approve.
* If you have any other issues, please reach out to [MURAL Identity support team](mailto:support@mural.co).
