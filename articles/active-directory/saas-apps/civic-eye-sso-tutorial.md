# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with CivicEye SSO

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate CivicEye SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Provide SSO functionality for our CivicEye Platform customers through their existing AD deployment. When you integrate CivicEye SSO with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to CivicEye SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to CivicEye SSO with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for CivicEye SSO in a test environment. CivicEye SSO supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with CivicEye SSO, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* CivicEye SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the CivicEye SSO application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add CivicEye SSO from the Azure AD gallery

Add CivicEye SSO from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with CivicEye SSO. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **CivicEye SSO** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<CustomerName>.civiceye.com`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<CustomerName>.civiceye.com/consumer`

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<CustomerName>.civiceye.com`

	> [!Note]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [CivicEye SSO support team](mailto:help@civiceye.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (Raw)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificateraw.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up CivicEye SSO** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure CivicEye SSO

To configure single sign-on on **CivicEye SSO** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [CivicEye SSO support team](mailto:help@civiceye.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create CivicEye SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at CivicEye SSO. Work with [CivicEye SSO support team](mailto:help@civiceye.com) to add the users in the CivicEye SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to CivicEye SSO Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to CivicEye SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the CivicEye SSO tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to CivicEye SSO Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

* [Plan a single sign-on deployment](../manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure CivicEye SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
