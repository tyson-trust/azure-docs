# Tutorial: Configure SchoolStream ASA for automatic user provisioning in SchoolStream ASA

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both SchoolStream ASA and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [SchoolStream ASA](https://www.ssk12.com/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in SchoolStream ASA 
> * Remove users in SchoolStream ASA  when they do not require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and SchoolStream ASA.
> * Provision groups and group memberships in SchoolStream ASA.
> * [Single sign-on](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-setup-oidc-sso.md) to SchoolStream ASA (recommended).


## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* A SchoolStream Website. Please contact [SchoolStream support](mailto:support@rtresponse.com) if you do not have one.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and SchoolStream ASA](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure SchoolStream ASA to support provisioning with Azure AD

1. Contact [SchoolStream support](mailto:support@rtresponse.com) to request SchoolStream ASA integration, you will need to provide your **Azure AD tenant Id** and your **SchoolStream Website URL**.

1. You will get your **Secret Token** and SchoolStream ASA **Tenant URL** after SchoolStream has mapped your SchoolStream Website and Azure AD tenant ID.

## Step 3. Add SchoolStream ASA from the Azure AD application gallery

To start managing provisioning to SchoolStream ASA in your Azure AD, you need to add SchoolStream ASA from the Azure AD application gallery. 

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Browse Azure AD Gallery** section, type **SchoolStream ASA** in the search box.
1. Select **SchoolStream ASA** from results panel and then **Sign up for the app**. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.


If you have previously setup SchoolStream ASA for SSO you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to SchoolStream ASA 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in SchoolStream ASA based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for SchoolStream ASA in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **SchoolStream ASA**.

	![The SchoolStream ASA link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

1. If you are configuring provisioning for the first time, select **Get started**.

	![Provisioning get started](media/schoolstream-asa-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-get-started.png)
	
1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](media/schoolstream-asa-provisioning-tutorial/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. In the **Admin Credentials** section, input your SchoolStream ASA **Tenant URL** and **Secret Token**. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to SchoolStream ASA. If the connection fails , ensure your SchoolStream ASA account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. Select **Save** to see the **Settings** section.

1. In the **Notification Email** field of **Settings** section, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Provision Azure Active Directory Users**.

1. Select **Add New Mapping** at the bottom.

1. In the dialog **Edit Attribute**: 
	
   * In the **Mapping type** field, select **Direct** from the dropdown,
   * In the **Source attribute** field, select **extensionAttribute1** from the dropdown,
   * Enter your **Azure AD tenant Id** in the field **Default value if null(optional)**,
   * In the **Target attribute** field, select **urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:organization** from the dropdown, 
   * In the **Match objects using this attribute** field, select **No** from the dropdown,
   * In the **Apply this mapping** field, select **Always** from the dropdown,
   * Select **OK**.

	   ![Edit Attribute](media/schoolstream-asa-provisioning-tutorial/add-mappings-attribute.png)

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to SchoolStream ASA in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in SchoolStream ASA for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the SchoolStream ASA API supports filtering users based on that attribute.



   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|
   |---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;
   |active|Boolean|   
   |displayName|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|
   |preferredLanguage|String|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |name.formatted|String|
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "mobile"].value|String|
   |externalId|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:organization|String| 


1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Groups to UNIFI**.

1. Review the group attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to UNIFI in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the groups in UNIFI for update operations. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

      |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|
      |---|---|---|
      |displayName|String|&check;
      |members|Reference|
      |externalId|String|      


1. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes. You can go back to the **Application** tab and select **Edit provisioning** to continue.

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for SchoolStream ASA, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to SchoolStream ASA by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).  

## Change log

* 09/24/2020 - Group provisioning got enabled.
