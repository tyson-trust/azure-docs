# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Easy Metrics Connector

In this article, you learn how to integrate Easy Metrics Connector with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This application is a bridge between Azure AD and Auth0, federating Authentication to Microsoft Azure AD for our customers. When you integrate Easy Metrics Connector with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Easy Metrics Connector.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Easy Metrics Connector with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Easy Metrics Connector in a test environment. Easy Metrics Connector supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Easy Metrics Connector, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Easy Metrics Connector single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Easy Metrics Connector application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Easy Metrics Connector from the Azure AD gallery

Add Easy Metrics Connector from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Easy Metrics Connector. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Easy Metrics Connector** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the value provided by [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com).

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the value provided by [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com).

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the value provided by [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com).

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (PEM)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificate-base64-download.png "Certificate")

## Configure Easy Metrics Connector SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Easy Metrics Connector** side, you need to send the **Certificate (PEM)** to [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Easy Metrics Connector test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Easy Metrics Connector. Work with [Easy Metrics Connector support team](mailto:support@easymetrics.com) to add the users in the Easy Metrics Connector platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Easy Metrics Connector Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Easy Metrics Connector Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Easy Metrics Connector tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Easy Metrics Connector Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

* [Plan a single sign-on deployment](../manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Easy Metrics Connector you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
