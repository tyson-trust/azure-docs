# Tutorial: Configure Real Links for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Real Links and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Real Links](https://www.reallinks.io) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities Supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Real Links
> * Remove users in Real Links when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Real Links
> * [Single sign-on](real-links-tutorial.md) to Real Links (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* A [Real Links](https://www.reallinks.io/) subscription - all tiers include automatic user provisioning.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Real Links](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure Real Links to support provisioning with Azure AD

To configure provisioning in your Real Links platform, you need to contact the [Real Links support team](mailto:support@reallinks.io) and request your SCIM-v2 provisioning details. This will include:

* Your platform's tenant URL
* Your unique secret token

## Step 3. Add Real Links from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Real Links from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Real Links. If you have previously setup Real Links for SSO, you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Real Links 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in Real Links based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Real Links in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Real Links**.

	![The Real Links link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

4. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

5. In the **Admin Credentials** section, input your Real Links Tenant URL and Secret Token. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Real Links. If the connection fails, ensure your Real Links account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Real Links**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Real Links in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Real Links for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the Real Links API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Real Links|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean||&check;
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:firstName|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:lastName|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:emailAddress|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:phoneNumber|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:title|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:preferredLanguage|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:organization|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:department|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:division|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:location|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:real-links:2.0:User:countryCode|String|

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Real Links, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Real Links by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).
