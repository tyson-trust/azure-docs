# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Cloud Academy

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Cloud Academy with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Cloud Academy with Azure AD, you can:

* Use Azure AD to control who can access Cloud Academy.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Cloud Academy with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A Cloud Academy subscription with single sign-on (SSO) enabled.

## Tutorial description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Cloud Academy supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Cloud Academy supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.
* Cloud Academy supports [Automated user provisioning](cloud-academy-sso-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Add Cloud Academy from the gallery

To configure the integration of Cloud Academy into Azure AD, you need to add Cloud Academy from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal with a work or school account or with a personal Microsoft account.
1. In the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Go to **Enterprise applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add an application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, enter **Cloud Academy** in the search box.
1. Select **Cloud Academy** in the results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, and walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Cloud Academy

You'll configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cloud Academy by using a test user named **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the corresponding user in Cloud Academy.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Cloud Academy, you'll complete these high-level steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use the feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on.
    1. **[Grant access to the test user](#grant-access-to-the-test-user)** to enable the user to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure single sign-on for Cloud Academy](#configure-single-sign-on-for-cloud-academy)** on the application side.
    1. **[Create a Cloud Academy test user](#create-a-cloud-academy-test-user)** as a counterpart to the Azure AD representation of the user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify that the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal:

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Cloud Academy** application integration page, in the **Manage** section, select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, select the pencil button for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/cloud-academy-sso-tutorial/test-sso-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Test S S O connection button.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're signed in to Cloud Academy by using the test user account you created, proceed with the test flow. Otherwise, close the dialog, scroll up to **General Settings**, copy and paste the subdomain URL in a private or incognito browser tab, and then sign in as the test user. If sign-in is successful, you can close the browser tab and select **Save and Test**. A browser tab will reopen the service provider dialog. Select **continue**, and then select **Test SSO connection** again. Finally, select **Test was successful** because you've already tested sign-in by using a private or incognito tab.
    >
    > Continue to the next step.

1. If sign-in is successful, you can activate SSO integration for the entire organization:

> For more information about how to configure Cloud Academy, see [Setting Up Single Sign-On](https://support.cloudacademy.com/hc/articles/360043908452-Setting-Up-Single-Sign-On).

### Create a Cloud Academy test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Cloud Academy. Cloud Academy supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Cloud Academy, a new one is created after authentication.

Cloud Academy also supports automatic user provisioning. For more information, see the [Cloud Academy SSO provisioning tutorial](./cloud-academy-sso-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD SSO configuration by using one of the following options:

* In the Azure portal, select **Test this application**. You're redirected to the Cloud Academy sign-on URL and you can initiate the sign-in flow.

* Go to Cloud Academy sign-on URL directly and initiate the sign-in flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Cloud Academy tile in the My Apps portal, this will redirect to Cloud Academy sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps portal, see [Introduction to My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

After you configure Cloud Academy, you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
