# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Watch by Colors

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Watch by Colors with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Watch by Colors with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Watch by Colors.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Watch by Colors with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Watch by Colors single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Watch by Colors supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Watch by Colors from the gallery

To configure the integration of Watch by Colors into Azure AD, you need to add Watch by Colors from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Watch by Colors** in the search box.
1. Select **Watch by Colors** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Watch by Colors SSO](#configure-watch-by-colors-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Watch by Colors test user](#create-watch-by-colors-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Watch by Colors that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Go to Watch by Colors Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Watch by Colors for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Watch by Colors tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Watch by Colors for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Watch by Colors you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
