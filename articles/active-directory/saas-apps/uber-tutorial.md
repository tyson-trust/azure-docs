# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Uber

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Uber with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This app helps you automatically provision and de-provision users to Uber for business using the Azure AD Provisioning service. When you integrate Uber with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Uber.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Uber with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Uber in a test environment. Uber supports **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Automated user provisioning**.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Uber, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Uber single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Uber application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Uber from the Azure AD gallery

Add Uber from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Uber. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Uber** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (PEM)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up Uber** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

## Configure Uber SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Uber** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (PEM)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Uber support team](mailto:business-api-support@uber.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Uber test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Uber. Work with [Uber support team](mailto:business-api-support@uber.com) to add the users in the Uber platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on. Uber also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](uber-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Uber for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Uber tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Uber for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Uber you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
