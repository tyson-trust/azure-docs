# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft in a test environment. Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft from the Azure AD gallery

Add Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: ` https://<SUBDOMAIN>.oraclecloud.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.oraclecloud.com/v1/saml/<UNIQUEID>`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    ` https://<SUBDOMAIN>.oraclecloud.com/`

    >[!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft support team](https://www.oracle.com/support/advanced-customer-services/cloud/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Configure Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft SSO

To configure single sign-on on Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft side, you need to send the downloaded Federation Metadata XML file from Azure portal to [Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft support team](https://www.oracle.com/support/advanced-customer-services/cloud/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft. Work with [Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft support team](https://www.oracle.com/support/advanced-customer-services/cloud/) to add the users in the Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Oracle IDCS for PeopleSoft you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
