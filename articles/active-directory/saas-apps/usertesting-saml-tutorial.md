# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with UserTesting

In this article, you learn how to integrate UserTesting with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). UserTesting is a platform for getting rapid customer feedback on almost any customer experience you can imagine, including websites, mobile apps, prototypes, and real world experiences. When you integrate UserTesting with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to UserTesting.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to UserTesting with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for UserTesting in a test environment. UserTesting supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with UserTesting, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* UserTesting single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the UserTesting application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add UserTesting from the Azure AD gallery

Add UserTesting from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with UserTesting. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **UserTesting** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.okta.com/saml2/service-provider/<Account_Name>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    ` https://auth.usertesting.com/sso/saml2/<ID>`

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    a. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://app.usertesting.com/users/sso_sign_in`

    b.In the **Relay State** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://app.usertesting.com/sessions/from_idp`

     > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [UserTesting Client support team](mailto:support@usertesting.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.
    
1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up UserTesting** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure UserTesting SSO

To configure single sign-on on **UserTesting** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [UserTesting support team](mailto:support@usertesting.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create UserTesting test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at UserTesting. Work with [UserTesting support team](mailto:support@usertesting.com) to add the users in the UserTesting platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to UserTesting Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to UserTesting Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the UserTesting for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the UserTesting tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the UserTesting for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure UserTesting you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
