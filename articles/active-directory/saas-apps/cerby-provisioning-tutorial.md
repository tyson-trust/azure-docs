# Tutorial: Configure Cerby for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to do in both Cerby and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Cerby](https://app.cerby.com/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Cerby
> * Remove users in Cerby when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Cerby
> * [Single sign-on](cerby-tutorial.md) to Cerby (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md) 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator).
* A user account in Cerby with the Workspace Owner role.
* The Cerby SAML2-based integration must be set up. Follow the instructions in the [How to Configure the Cerby App Gallery SAML App with Your Azure AD Tenant](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5457563-how-to-configure-the-cerby-app-gallery-saml-app-with-your-azure-ad-tenant) article to set up the integration.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Cerby](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure Cerby to support provisioning with Azure AD
Cerby has enabled by default the provisioning support for Azure AD. You must only retrieve the SCIM API authentication token by completing the following steps:

1. Log in to your corresponding [Cerby workspace](https://app.cerby.com/).
1. Click the **Hi there < user >!** button located at the bottom of the left side navigation menu. A drop-down menu is displayed.
1. Select the **Workspace Configuration** option related to your account from the drop-down menu. The **Workspace Configuration** page is displayed.
1. Activate the **IDP Settings** tab.
1. Click the **View Token** button located in the **Directory Sync** section of the **IDP Settings** tab. A pop-up window is displayed waiting to confirm your identity, and a push notification is sent to your Cerby mobile application.
**IMPORTANT:** To confirm your identity, you must have installed and logged in to the Cerby mobile application to receive push notifications.
1. Click the **It's me!** button in the **Confirmation Request** screen of your Cerby mobile application to confirm your identity. The pop-up window in your Cerby workspace is closed, and the **Show Token** pop-up window is displayed.
1. Click the **Copy** button to copy the SCIM token to the clipboard.

	>[!TIP]
	>Keep the **Show Token** pop-up window open to copy the token at any time. You need the token to configure provisioning with Azure AD.

## Step 3. Add Cerby from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Cerby from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Cerby. If you have previously setup Cerby for SSO, you can use the same application. However it's recommended you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user and group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to Cerby 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and groups in Cerby based on user and group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Cerby in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Cerby**.

	![The Cerby link in the Applications list](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Provisioning tab](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Provisioning tab automatic](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. In the **Admin Credentials** section, input `https://api.cerby.com/v1/scim/v2` as your Cerby Tenant URL and the SCIM API authentication token that you have previously retrieved. 

1. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Cerby. If the connection fails, ensure your Cerby account has Admin permissions and try again.

	![Token](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Notification Email](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. In the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Cerby**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Cerby in the **Attribute Mappings** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Cerby for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you'll need to ensure that the Cerby API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by Cerby|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |emails[type eq "work"].value|String|&check;|&check;   
   |active|Boolean||&check;
   |name.givenName|String||&check;
   |name.familyName|String||&check;
   |externalId|String||

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Cerby, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Status Toggled On](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and groups that you would like to provision to Cerby by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Provisioning Scope](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you're ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Saving Provisioning Configuration](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to complete than next cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it's to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).  

## Troubleshooting Tips
If you need to regenerate the SCIM API authentication token, complete the following steps:

1. Send an email with your request to [Cerby Support Team](mailto:support@cerby.com). The Cerby team regenerates the SCIM API authentication token.
1. Receive the response email from Cerby to confirm that the token was successfully regenerated.
1. Complete the instructions from the [How to Retrieve the SCIM API Authentication Token from Cerby](https://help.cerby.com/en/articles/5638472-how-to-configure-automatic-user-provisioning-for-azure-ad) article to retrieve the new token.

	>[!NOTE]
	>The Cerby team is currently developing a self-service solution for regenerating the SCIM API authentication token. To regenerate the token, the Cerby team members must validate their identity.
