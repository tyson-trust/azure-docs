# Tutorial: Configure Zoom for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both Zoom and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users and groups to [Zoom](https://zoom.us/pricing/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in Zoom
> * Remove users in Zoom when they do not require access anymore
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and Zoom
> * [Single sign-on](./zoom-tutorial.md) to Zoom (recommended)

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md).
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (e.g. Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* [A Zoom tenant](https://zoom.us/pricing).
* A user account in Zoom with Admin permissions.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and Zoom](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Add Zoom from the Azure AD application gallery

Add Zoom from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to Zoom. If you have previously setup Zoom for SSO you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 3. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user / group. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users and groups to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user or group, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users and groups before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users and groups, you can control this by assigning one or two users or groups to the app. When scope is set to all users and groups, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.


## Step 4. Configure automatic user provisioning to Zoom 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users and/or groups in TestApp based on user and/or group assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for Zoom in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.userProvisioningV2Authentication=true), ensure you are using the link (https://portal.azure.com/?feature.userProvisioningV2Authentication=true) then Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Screenshot of the Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **Zoom**.

	![Screenshot of the Zoom link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of the Manage options with the Provisioning option called out.](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Mode dropdown list with the Automatic option called out.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, select **OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant**. Enter `https://api.zoom.us/scim` in **Tenant URL**, click on **Authorize**, make sure that you enter your Zoom account's Admin credentials. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to Zoom. If the connection fails, ensure your Zoom account has Admin permissions and try again.

	> [!NOTE] 
	> You will have two options for your Authentication Method: **Bearer Authentication** and **OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant**. Make sure that you select OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant. Zoom no longer supports the **Bearer Authentication** method

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person or group who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of the Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Zoom**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Zoom in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Zoom for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the Zoom API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|
   |---|---|
   |userName|String|
   |active|Boolean|
   |name.givenName|String|
   |name.familyName|String|
   |emails[type eq "work"]|String|
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department|String|

1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Screenshot of the Scoping filter tutorial.](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Zoom, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users and/or groups that you would like to provision to Zoom by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of the Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users and groups defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 5. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

1. Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
2. Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
3. If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).  

## Connector limitations
* Zoom only allows a maximum of 9,999 basic users today.

## Change log
* 05/14/2020 - Support for UPDATE operations  added for emails[type eq "work"] attribute.
* 10/20/2020 - Added support for two new roles **Licensed** and **on-premises** to replace existing roles **Pro** and **Corp**. Support for roles **Pro** and **Corp** will be removed in the future.
* 05/30/2023 - Added support for new authentication method i.e. **OAuth 2.0**.
