# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Way We Do

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Way We Do with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Way We Do with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Way We Do.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Way We Do with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Way We Do, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Way We Do single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Way We Do supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Way We Do supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Way We Do from the gallery

To configure the integration of Way We Do into Azure AD, you need to add Way We Do from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Way We Do** in the search box.
1. Select **Way We Do** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Way We Do

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Way We Do using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Way We Do.

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Way We Do SSO](#configure-way-we-do-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Way We Do test user](#create-way-we-do-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Way We Do that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

If the email address does not match an active user in Way We Do, it automatically adds a new user account for the person signing in, requesting any missing information.

          > [!NOTE]
          > Users added through single sign-on are added as general users and are not assigned a role in the system. An Administrator is able to go in and modify their security role as an editor or administrator and can also assign one or several Org Chart roles.

### Create Way We Do test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Way We Do. Way We Do supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Way We Do, a new one is created after authentication.

> [!Note]

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Way We Do Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Way We Do Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Way We Do tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Way We Do Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Way We Do you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
