# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Central Desktop

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Central Desktop with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Central Desktop with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Central Desktop.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Central Desktop with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Central Desktop single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Central Desktop supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Central Desktop from the gallery

To configure the integration of Central Desktop into Azure AD, you need to add Central Desktop from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Central Desktop** in the search box.
1. Select **Central Desktop** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Central Desktop

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Central Desktop using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Central Desktop.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Central Desktop, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Central Desktop SSO](#configure-central-desktop-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Central Desktop test user](#create-central-desktop-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Central Desktop that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Central Desktop** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Identifier** |
    |-------|
    | `https://<companyname>.centraldesktop.com/saml2-metadata.php` |
    | `https://<companyname>.imeetcentral.com/saml2-metadata.php` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.centraldesktop.com/saml2-assertion.php`

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<companyname>.centraldesktop.com`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier,Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [Central Desktop Client support team](https://imeetcentral.com/contact-us) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Raw)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

   > The users that you add receive an email that includes a confirmation link for activating their accounts.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Central Desktop Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Central Desktop Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Central Desktop tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Central Desktop Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Central Desktop you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
