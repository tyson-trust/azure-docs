# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO

In this article, you learn how to integrate Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Avionte provides staffing and recruiting software solutions for the staffing industry. When you integrate Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO in a test environment. Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO from the Azure AD gallery

Add Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO support team](mailto:Support@avionte.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO. Work with [Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO support team](mailto:Support@avionte.com) to add the users in the Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Avionte Bold SAML Federated SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
