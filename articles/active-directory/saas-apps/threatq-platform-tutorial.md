# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with ThreatQ Platform

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate ThreatQ Platform with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). ThreatQ improves the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations by fusing disparate data sources, tools and teams to accelerate and automate threat detection, investigation and response. When you integrate ThreatQ Platform with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ThreatQ Platform.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ThreatQ Platform with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for ThreatQ Platform in a test environment. ThreatQ Platform supports **SP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with ThreatQ Platform, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ThreatQ Platform single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the ThreatQ Platform application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add ThreatQ Platform from the Azure AD gallery

Add ThreatQ Platform from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with ThreatQ Platform. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **ThreatQ Platform** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Customer_Environment>.threatq.online/api/saml/metadata`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Customer_Environment>.threatq.online/api/saml/acs`

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<Customer_Environment>.threatq.online/`

	> [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [ThreatQ Platform support team](mailto:support@threatq.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your ThreatQ Platform application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but ThreatQ Platform expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, ThreatQ Platform application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | uid | user.mail |
	| Groups | user.groups |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (PEM)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificate-base64-download.png)

1. On the **Set up ThreatQ Platform** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure ThreatQ Platform SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ThreatQ Platform** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (PEM)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [ThreatQ Platform support team](mailto:support@threatq.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ThreatQ Platform test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in ThreatQ Platform. ThreatQ Platform supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in ThreatQ Platform, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to ThreatQ Platform Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ThreatQ Platform Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ThreatQ Platform tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to ThreatQ Platform Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure ThreatQ Platform you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
