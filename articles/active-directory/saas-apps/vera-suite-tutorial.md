# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Vera Suite

In this article, you learn how to integrate Vera Suite with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Vera Suite helps auto dealers maintain cultures of safety, streamline operations and manage risk. Vera Suite offers dealership workforce and workplace compliance solutions for EHS, HR and F&I managers. When you integrate Vera Suite with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Vera Suite.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Vera Suite with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Vera Suite in a test environment. Vera Suite supports **SP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Vera Suite, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Vera Suite single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Vera Suite application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Vera Suite from the Azure AD gallery

Add Vera Suite from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Vera Suite. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Vera Suite** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

## Configure Vera Suite SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Vera Suite** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Vera Suite support team](mailto:support@kpa.io). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Vera Suite test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Vera Suite. Vera Suite supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Vera Suite, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Vera Suite Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Vera Suite Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Vera Suite tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Vera Suite Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Vera Suite you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
