# Tutorial: Configure LawVu for automatic user provisioning

This tutorial describes the steps you need to perform in both LawVu and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to configure automatic user provisioning. When configured, Azure AD automatically provisions and de-provisions users to [LawVu](https://lawvu.com/) using the Azure AD Provisioning service. For important details on what this service does, how it works, and frequently asked questions, see [Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to SaaS applications with Azure Active Directory](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md). 


## Capabilities supported
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create users in LawVu.
> * Remove users in LawVu when they do not require access anymore.
> * Keep user attributes synchronized between Azure AD and LawVu.
> * [Single sign-on](lawvu-tutorial.md) to LawVu (recommended).

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following prerequisites:

* [An Azure AD tenant](../develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant.md). 
* A user account in Azure AD with [permission](../roles/permissions-reference.md) to configure provisioning (for example, Application Administrator, Cloud Application administrator, Application Owner, or Global Administrator). 
* The Tenant URL and Secret Token.
* Global Administrative rights for the Active Directory.
* Access rights to set up Enterprise applications.
* An active LawVu account.

## Step 1. Plan your provisioning deployment
1. Learn about [how the provisioning service works](../app-provisioning/user-provisioning.md).
1. Determine who will be in [scope for provisioning](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).
1. Determine what data to [map between Azure AD and LawVu](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md). 

## Step 2. Configure LawVu to support provisioning with Azure AD
Your contact at LawVu will send you a LawVu Tenant URL and corresponding Secret Token.


## Step 3. Add LawVu from the Azure AD application gallery

Add LawVu from the Azure AD application gallery to start managing provisioning to LawVu. If you have previously setup LawVu for SSO, you can use the same application. However it is recommended that you create a separate app when testing out the integration initially. Learn more about adding an application from the gallery [here](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md). 

## Step 4. Define who will be in scope for provisioning 

The Azure AD provisioning service allows you to scope who will be provisioned based on assignment to the application and or based on attributes of the user. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned to your app based on assignment, you can use the following [steps](../manage-apps/assign-user-or-group-access-portal.md) to assign users to the application. If you choose to scope who will be provisioned based solely on attributes of the user, you can use a scoping filter as described [here](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md). 

* Start small. Test with a small set of users before rolling out to everyone. When scope for provisioning is set to assigned users, you can control this by assigning one or two users to the app. When scope is set to all users, you can specify an [attribute based scoping filter](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

* If you need additional roles, you can [update the application manifest](../develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps.md) to add new roles.

## Step 5. Configure automatic user provisioning to LawVu 

This section guides you through the steps to configure the Azure AD provisioning service to create, update, and disable users in LawVu based on user assignments in Azure AD.

### To configure automatic user provisioning for LawVu in Azure AD:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **Enterprise Applications**, then select **All applications**.

	![Screenshot of Enterprise applications blade.](common/enterprise-applications.png)

1. In the applications list, select **LawVu**.

	![Screenshot of the LawVu link in the Applications list.](common/all-applications.png)

1. Select the **Provisioning** tab.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab,](common/provisioning.png)

1. Set the **Provisioning Mode** to **Automatic**.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning tab automatic.](common/provisioning-automatic.png)

1. Under the **Admin Credentials** section, input your LawVu Tenant URL and corresponding Secret Token. Click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to LawVu.

 	![Screenshot of Token.](common/provisioning-testconnection-tenanturltoken.png)

1. In the **Notification Email** field, enter the email address of a person who should receive the provisioning error notifications and select the **Send an email notification when a failure occurs** check box.

	![Screenshot of Notification Email.](common/provisioning-notification-email.png)

1. Select **Save**.

1. Under the **Mappings** section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to LawVu**.

1. Review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to LawVu in the **Attribute-Mapping** section. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in LawVu for update operations. If you choose to change the [matching target attribute](../app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes.md), you will need to ensure that the LawVu API supports filtering users based on that attribute. Select the **Save** button to commit any changes.

   |Attribute|Type|Supported for filtering|Required by LawVu|
   |---|---|---|---|
   |userName|String|&check;|&check;
   |externalId|String|&check;|&check;
   |active|Boolean|||
   |title|String|||
   |name.givenName|String||&check; 
   |name.familyName|String||&check; 
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "work"].value|String|||
   |phoneNumbers[type eq "mobile"].value|String|||
   |urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:enterprise:2.0:User:department|String||

	>[!NOTE]
	>LawVu app support **Schema Discovery**. The `/schemas` request will be made by the Azure AD Provisioning Service every time someone saves the provisioning configuration in the Azure portal or every time a user lands on the edit provisioning page in the Azure portal. Other attributes discovered will be surfaced to customers in the attribute mappings under the target attribute list. Schema discovery only leads to more target attributes being added. It will not result in attributes being removed.
	
1. To configure scoping filters, refer to the following instructions provided in the [Scoping filter tutorial](../app-provisioning/define-conditional-rules-for-provisioning-user-accounts.md).

1. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for LawVu, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Status Toggled On.](common/provisioning-toggle-on.png)

1. Define the users that you would like to provision to LawVu by choosing the desired values in **Scope** in the **Settings** section.

	![Screenshot of Provisioning Scope.](common/provisioning-scope.png)

1. When you are ready to provision, click **Save**.

	![Screenshot of Saving Provisioning Configuration.](common/provisioning-configuration-save.png)

This operation starts the initial synchronization cycle of all users defined in **Scope** in the **Settings** section. The initial cycle takes longer to perform than subsequent cycles, which occur approximately every 40 minutes as long as the Azure AD provisioning service is running. 

## Step 6. Monitor your deployment
Once you've configured provisioning, use the following resources to monitor your deployment:

* Use the [provisioning logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md) to determine which users have been provisioned successfully or unsuccessfully
* Check the [progress bar](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-when-will-provisioning-finish-specific-user.md) to see the status of the provisioning cycle and how close it is to completion
* If the provisioning configuration seems to be in an unhealthy state, the application will go into quarantine. Learn more about quarantine states [here](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-quarantine-status.md).
