# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with goFLUENT

In this article, you learn how to integrate goFLUENT with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). goFLUENT, the world's leading language training provider, delivers a hyper-personalized learning experience that builds confidence, empowers career growth, and establishes an inclusive global culture. When you integrate goFLUENT with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to goFLUENT.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to goFLUENT with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for goFLUENT in a test environment. goFLUENT supports **SP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with goFLUENT, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* goFLUENT single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the goFLUENT application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add goFLUENT from the Azure AD gallery

Add goFLUENT from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with goFLUENT. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **goFLUENT** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CustomerName>.gofluent.com/samlsso/metadata.jsp?pid=<CustomerName>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<CustomerName>.gofluent.com/samlsso/acs.jsp?pid=<CustomerName>`

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
	`https://<CustomerName>.gofluent.com`

	> [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [goFLUENT Client support team](mailto:presales-team@gofluent.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up goFLUENT** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure goFLUENT SSO

To configure single sign-on on **goFLUENT** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [goFLUENT support team](mailto:presales-team@gofluent.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create goFLUENT test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in goFLUENT. goFLUENT supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in goFLUENT, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to goFLUENT Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to goFLUENT Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the goFLUENT tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to goFLUENT Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure goFLUENT you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
