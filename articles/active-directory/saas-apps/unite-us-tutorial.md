# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Unite Us

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Unite Us with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Unite Us provides a default implementation for SCIM user provisioning and SAML SSO /JIT. When you integrate Unite Us with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Unite Us.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Unite Us with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Unite Us in a test environment. Unite Us supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Unite Us, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Unite Us single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Unite Us application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Unite Us from the Azure AD gallery

Add Unite Us from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Unite Us. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Unite Us** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following patterns:

    | **Identifier** |
    |-----------|
    | `https://<CustomerIdentifier>.uniteustraining.com/auth/saml/metadata` |
    | `https://<CustomerIdentifier>.uniteus.io/auth/saml/metadata` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following patterns:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |-------------|
    | `https://<CustomerIdentifier>.uniteustraining.com/auth/saml/callback` |
    | `https://<CustomerIdentifier>.uniteus.io/auth/saml/callback` |

1. If you want to configure **SP** initiated SSO, then perform the following step:  

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Sign on URL** |
    |-------------|
    | `https://app.auth.uniteus.io/` |
    | `https://app.auth.uniteustraining.com/` |

    > [!Note]
    > These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Unite Us Client support team](mailto:isd.support@uniteus.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Unite Us** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows how to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Unite Us SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Unite Us** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Unite Us support team](mailto:isd.support@uniteus.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Unite Us test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Unite Us. Unite Us supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Unite Us, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Unite Us Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Unite Us Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Unite Us for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Unite Us tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Unite Us for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Unite Us you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
