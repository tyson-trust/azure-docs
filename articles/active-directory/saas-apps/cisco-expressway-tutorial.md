# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Cisco Expressway

In this article, you learn how to integrate Cisco Expressway with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Cisco Expressway is a suite of applications that provide call control and related functions for IP Telephony systems, also provides tools for media quality analysis in the presence of media flows. When you integrate Cisco Expressway with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Cisco Expressway.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Cisco Expressway with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Cisco Expressway in a test environment. Cisco Expressway supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Cisco Expressway, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Cisco Expressway single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Cisco Expressway application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Cisco Expressway from the Azure AD gallery

Add Cisco Expressway from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Cisco Expressway. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Cisco Expressway** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you have **Service Provider metadata file** then perform the following steps:

	a. Click **Upload metadata file**.

    ![Screenshot shows how to upload metadata file.](common/upload-metadata.png "File")

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![Screenshot shows how to choose and browse metadata file.](common/browse-upload-metadata.png "Folder")

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values get auto populated in Basic SAML Configuration section.

	> [!Note]
	> You will get the **Service Provider metadata file** from the [Cisco Expressway support team](mailto:Tp-global@cisco.com). If the **Identifier** and **Reply URL** values do not get auto populated, then fill the values manually according to your requirement.

1. Cisco Expressway application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

1. In addition to above, Cisco Expressway application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
	| uid | user.onpremisessamaccountname |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Cisco Expressway** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows how to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure Cisco Expressway SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Cisco Expressway** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Cisco Expressway support team](mailto:Tp-global@cisco.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Cisco Expressway test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Cisco Expressway. Work with [Cisco Expressway support team](mailto:Tp-global@cisco.com) to add the users in the Cisco Expressway platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Cisco Expressway Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Cisco Expressway Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Cisco Expressway tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Cisco Expressway Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Cisco Expressway you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
