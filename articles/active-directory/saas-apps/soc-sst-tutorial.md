# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with SOC SST

In this article, you learn how to integrate SOC SST with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The SOC complies with the mandatory legal documentation, which can be managed within the software by public and private companies that have registered employees (CLT). When you integrate SOC SST with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SOC SST.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SOC SST with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for SOC SST in a test environment. SOC SST supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with SOC SST, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SOC SST single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the SOC SST application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add SOC SST from the Azure AD gallery

Add SOC SST from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with SOC SST. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SOC SST** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a value using the following pattern:
    `<InstanceName>.soc.com.br`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://sistema.soc.com.br/WebSoc/sso/<CustomerID>/saml/finalize.action`

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://sistema.soc.com.br/WebSoc/sp/<CustomerID>/login`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [SOC SST Client support team](mailto:suporte@soc.com.br) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Certificate (PEM)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificate-base64-download.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up SOC SST** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure SOC SST SSO

To configure single sign-on on **SOC SST** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (PEM)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [SOC SST support team](mailto:suporte@soc.com.br). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create SOC SST test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at SOC SST. Work with [SOC SST support team](mailto:suporte@soc.com.br) to add the users in the SOC SST platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to SOC SST Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to SOC SST Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the SOC SST for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the SOC SST tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the SOC SST for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure SOC SST you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
