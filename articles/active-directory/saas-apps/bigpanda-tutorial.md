# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with BigPanda

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate BigPanda with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). BigPanda transforms IT data into actionable intelligence and automation, enabling incident response teams to increase uptime, efficiency, and velocity. When you integrate BigPanda with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to BigPanda.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to BigPanda with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for BigPanda in a test environment. BigPanda supports both **SP** and **IDP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with BigPanda, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* A BigPanda account with the Single Sign On role set to Full Access. See [Roles and Resource Permissions](https://docs.bigpanda.io/docs/roles-management#roles-and-resource-permissions) in the BigPanda documentation for more information.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the BigPanda application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add BigPanda from the Azure AD gallery

Add BigPanda from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with BigPanda. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **BigPanda** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://bigpanda.io/SAML2`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://api.bigpanda.io/login/<ORG_NAME>/azure/callback`

1. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, then perform the following step:

    In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://api.bigpanda.io/login/<INSTANCE>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign on URL. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the file and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up BigPanda** section, copy the **Login URL**.

## Configure BigPanda SSO

To configure single sign-on on **BigPanda** side, please follow the instructions from [BigPanda documentation](https://docs.bigpanda.io/docs/azure-ad-active-directory). 

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to BigPanda Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to BigPanda Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the BigPanda for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the BigPanda tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the BigPanda for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure BigPanda you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
