# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite in a test environment. Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite from the Azure AD gallery

Add Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: ` https://<SUBDOMAIN>.oraclecloud.com/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.oraclecloud.com/v1/saml/<UNIQUEID>>`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    ` https://<SUBDOMAIN>.oraclecloud.com/`

1. Your Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. The default value of **Unique User Identifier** is **user.userprincipalname** but Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite expects this to be mapped with the user's email address. For that you can use **user.mail** attribute from the list or use the appropriate attribute value based on your organization configuration.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

## Configure Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite SSO

1. Sign to the Oracle Access Manager console as an Administrator.
1. Click the **Federation** tab at the top of the console.
1. In the **Federation** area of the **Launch Pad** tab, click **Service Provider Management**.
1. On the Service Provider Administration tab, click **Create Identity Provider Partner**.
1. In the **General** area, enter a name for the **Identity Provider partner** and select both **Enable Partner and Default Identity Provider Partner**. Go to the next step before saving.
1. In the **Service Information** area:

    a. Select **SAML2.0** as the protocol.

    b. Select **Load from provider metadata**.

    c. Click **Browse** (for Windows) or **Choose File** (for Mac) and select the **Federation Metadata XML** file that you downloaded from Azure portal.

    d. Go to the next step before saving.

1. In the **Mapping Options** area:

    a. Select the **User Identity Store** option that will be used as the Oracle Access Manager LDAP identity store that is checked for E-Business Suite users. Typically, this is already configured as the Oracle Access Manager identity store.

    b. Leave **User Search Base DN** blank. The search base is automatically picked from the identity store configuration.

    c. Select **Map assertion Name ID to User ID Store attribute** and enter mail in the text box.

1. Click **Save** to save the identity provider partner.
1. After the partner is saved, come back to the **Advanced** area at the bottom of the tab. Ensure that the options are configured as follows:

    a. **Enable global logout** is selected.

    b. **HTTP POST SSO** Response Binding is selected.

### Create Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite. Work with [Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite support team](https://www.oracle.com/support/advanced-customer-services/cloud/) to add the users in the Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you select the Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Oracle Access Manager for Oracle E-Business Suite you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
