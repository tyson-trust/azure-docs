# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with SURFconext

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate SURFconext with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). SURF connected institutions can use SURFconext to log in to many cloud applications with their institution credentials. When you integrate SURFconext with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SURFconext.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SURFconext with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for SURFconext in a test environment. SURFconext supports **SP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with SURFconext, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SURFconext single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the SURFconext application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add SURFconext from the Azure AD gallery

Add SURFconext from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with SURFconext. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SURFconext** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows how to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

	| Environment | URL |
	|-------|---------|
	| Production |`https://engine.surfconext.nl/authentication/sp/metadata` | 
	| Staging |`https://engine.test.surfconext.nl/authentication/sp/metadata` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

	| Environment | URL |
	|-------|---------|
	| Production | `https://engine.surfconext.nl/authentication/sp/consume-assertion` |
	| Staging | `https://engine.test.surfconext.nl/authentication/sp/consume-assertion` |

	c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type one of the following URLs:

	| Environment | URL |
	|-------|---------|
	| Production | `https://engine.surfconext.nl/authentication/sp/debug` |
	| Staging | `https://engine.test.surfconext.nl/authentication/sp/debug` |

1. SURFconext application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of attributes configuration.](common/default-attributes.png "Image")

	> [!Note]
	> You can remove or delete these default attributes manually under Additional claims section, if it is not required.

1. In addition to above, SURFconext application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------|  --------- |
    | urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:cn | user.displayname |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:displayName | user.displayname |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:eduPersonPrincipalName | user.userprincipalname |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:givenName | user.givenname |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:mail | user.mail |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:preferredLanguage | user.preferredlanguage |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:sn | user.surname |
	| urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:uid | user.userprincipalname |
	| urn:mace:terena.org:attribute-def:schacHomeOrganization | user.userprincipalname |

1. To perform Transform operation for **urn:mace:terena.org:attribute-def:schacHomeOrganization** claim, select **Transformation** button as a Source under **Manage claim** section.

1. In the **Manage transformation** page, perform the following steps:

	![Screenshot shows the Azure portal attributes.](media/surfconext-tutorial/transform.png "Admin")

	1. Select **Extract()** from the dropdown in **Transformation** field and click **After matching** button.

	1. Select **Attribute** as a **Parameter 1 (Input)**.

	1. In the **Attribute name** field, select **user.userprinciplename** from the dropdown.

	1. Select **@** value from the dropdown.

	1. Click **Add**.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/copy-metadataurl.png "Certificate")

## Configure SURFconext SSO

To configure single sign-on on **SURFconext** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [SURFconext support team](mailto:support@surfconext.nl). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create SURFconext test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in SURFconext. SURFconext supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There's no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in SURFconext, a new one is commonly created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to SURFconext Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to SURFconext Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SURFconext tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to SURFconext Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure SURFconext you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
