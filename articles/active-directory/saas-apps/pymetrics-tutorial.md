# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with pymetrics

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate pymetrics with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate pymetrics with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to pymetrics.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to pymetrics with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* pymetrics single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* pymetrics supports **SP** initiated SSO. If you need to configure an **IDP** initiated flow, please reach out to [pymetrics support](mailto:solutions-engineering@pymetrics.com).
* pymetrics supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add pymetrics from the gallery

To configure the integration of pymetrics into Azure AD, you need to add pymetrics from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **pymetrics** in the search box.
1. Select **pymetrics** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for pymetrics

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with pymetrics using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in pymetrics.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with pymetrics, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure pymetrics SSO](#configure-pymetrics-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create pymetrics test user](#create-pymetrics-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in pymetrics that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **pymetrics** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.pymetrics.com/saml2-sp/<CUSTOMERNAME>/<CUSTOMERNAME>/metadata/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.pymetrics.com/saml2-sp/<CUSTOMERNAME>/<CUSTOMERNAME>/?acs`

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.pymetrics.com/saml2-sp/<CUSTOMERNAME>/<CUSTOMERNAME>/?sso`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [pymetrics Client support team](mailto:solutions-engineering@pymetrics.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. The pymetrics application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following table shows the list of default attributes. These attributes are prepopulated but you can review them as per your requirements.
	
	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| --------------- | --------- |
	| UserFirstName | user.givenname |
	| UserLastName | user.surname |
	| UserEmail | user.userprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up pymetrics** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate U R L.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")  

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to pymetrics.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **pymetrics**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure pymetrics SSO

To configure single sign-on on **pymetrics** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [pymetrics support team](mailto:solutions-engineering@pymetrics.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create pymetrics test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in pymetrics. pymetrics supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in pymetrics, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to pymetrics Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to pymetrics Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the pymetrics tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to pymetrics Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure pymetrics you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
