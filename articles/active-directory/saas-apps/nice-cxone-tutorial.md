# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with NICE CXone

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate NICE CXone with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate NICE CXone with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to NICE CXone.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to NICE CXone with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* NICE CXone single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* NICE CXone supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add NICE CXone from the gallery

To configure the integration of NICE CXone into Azure AD, you need to add NICE CXone from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **NICE CXone** in the search box.
1. Select **NICE CXone** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for NICE CXone

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with NICE CXone using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user at NICE CXone.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with NICE CXone, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure NICE CXone SSO](#configure-nice-cxone-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create NICE CXone test user](#create-nice-cxone-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in NICE CXone that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **NICE CXone** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Identifier** |
    |----------|
    | `https://cxone.niceincontact.com/<guid>` |
    | `https://cxone-gov.niceincontact.com/<guid>` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:
    
    | **Reply URL** |
    |---------|
    | `https://cxone.niceincontact.com/auth/authorize?tenantId=<guid>` |
    | `https://cxone-gov.niceincontact.com/auth/authorize?tenantId=<guid>` |

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Sign-on URL** |
    |----------|
    | `https://cxone.niceincontact.com` |
    | `https://cxone-gov.niceincontact.com` |

    > [!Note]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [NICE CXone support team](https://www.nice.com/services/customer-support) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificatebase64.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up NICE CXone** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to NICE CXone.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **NICE CXone**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure NICE CXone SSO

To configure single sign-on on **NICE CXone** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [NICE CXone support team](https://www.nice.com/services/customer-support). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create NICE CXone test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon at NICE CXone. Work with [NICE CXone support team](https://www.nice.com/services/customer-support) to add the users in the NICE CXone platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to NICE CXone Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to NICE CXone Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the NICE CXone tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to NICE CXone Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure NICE CXone you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
