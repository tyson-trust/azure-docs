# Tutorial: Integrate Wandera RADAR Admin with Azure Active Directory

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Wandera RADAR Admin with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Wandera RADAR Admin with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Wandera RADAR Admin.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Wandera RADAR Admin with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Wandera RADAR Admin single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Wandera RADAR Admin supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Wandera RADAR Admin from the gallery

To configure the integration of Wandera RADAR Admin into Azure AD, you need to add Wandera RADAR Admin from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Wandera RADAR Admin** in the search box.
1. Select **Wandera RADAR Admin** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Wandera RADAR Admin

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Wandera RADAR Admin using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Wandera RADAR Admin.

   1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Wandera RADAR Admin SSO](#configure-wandera-radar-admin-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
   1. **[Create Wandera RADAR Admin test user](#create-wandera-radar-admin-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Wandera RADAR Admin that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.
