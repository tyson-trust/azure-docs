# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with SkyDesk Email

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SkyDesk Email with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate SkyDesk Email with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SkyDesk Email.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SkyDesk Email with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SkyDesk Email single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* SkyDesk Email supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add SkyDesk Email from the gallery

To configure the integration of SkyDesk Email into Azure AD, you need to add SkyDesk Email from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SkyDesk Email** in the search box.
1. Select **SkyDesk Email** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for SkyDesk Email

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with SkyDesk Email using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SkyDesk Email.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SkyDesk Email, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SkyDesk Email SSO](#configure-skydesk-email-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SkyDesk Email test user](#create-skydesk-email-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SkyDesk Email that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SkyDesk Email** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

## Next steps

Once you configure SkyDesk Email you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
