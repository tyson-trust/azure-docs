# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Flock

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Flock with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Flock with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Flock.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Flock with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.


## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Flock single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Flock supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Flock supports [Automated user provisioning](flock-provisioning-tutorial.md).

## Adding Flock from the gallery

To configure the integration of Flock into Azure AD, you need to add Flock from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Flock** in the search box.
1. Select **Flock** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides)

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Flock

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Flock using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Flock.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Flock, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Flock SSO](#configure-flock-sso)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Flock test user](#create-flock-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Flock that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Flock** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.flock.com/`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.flock.com/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign on URL and Identifier. Contact [Flock Client support team](mailto:support@flock.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

6. On the **Set up Flock** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Flock.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Flock**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Flock SSO

1. In a different web browser window, log in to your Flock company site as an administrator.

2. Select **Authentication** tab from the left navigation panel and then select **SAML Authentication**.

3. In the **SAML Authentication** section, perform the following steps:

	![Flock Configuration](./media/flock-tutorial/saml-authentication.png)

	a. In the **SAML 2.0 Endpoint(HTTP)** textbox, paste **Login URL** value which you have copied from the Azure portal.

	b. In the **Identity Provider Issuer** textbox, paste **Azure Ad Identifier** value which you have copied from the Azure portal.

	c. Open the downloaded **Certificate(Base64)** from Azure portal in notepad, paste the content into the **Public Certificate** textbox.

	d. Click **Save**.

### Create Flock test user

To enable Azure AD users to log in to Flock, they must be provisioned into Flock. In the case of Flock, provisioning is a manual task.

**To provision a user account, perform the following steps:**

1. Log in to your Flock company site as an administrator.

2. Click **Manage Team** from the left navigation panel.

    ![Screenshot that shows "Manage Team" selected.](./media/flock-tutorial/user-1.png)

3. Click **Add Member** tab and then select **Team Members**.

	![Screenshot that shows the "Add Member" tab and "Team Members" selected.](./media/flock-tutorial/user-2.png)

4. Enter the email address of the user like **Brittasimon\@contoso.com** and then select **Add Users**.

> [!NOTE]
>Flock also supports automatic user provisioning, you can find more details [here](./flock-provisioning-tutorial.md) on how to configure automatic user provisioning.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Flock Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Flock Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Flock tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Flock Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).


## Next steps

Once you configure Flock you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
