# Configure Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication settings

To customize the end-user experience for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, you can configure options for settings like account lockout thresholds or fraud alerts and notifications. 
 
The following Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication settings are available:

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Account lockout (MFA Server only)](#account-lockout-mfa-server-only) | Temporarily lock accounts from using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication if there are too many denied authentication attempts in a row. This feature applies only to users who use MFA Server to enter a PIN to authenticate. |
| [Block/unblock users](#block-and-unblock-users) | Block specific users from being able to receive Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication requests. Any authentication attempts for blocked users are automatically denied. Users remain blocked for 90 days from the time that they're blocked or until they're manually unblocked. |
| [Report suspicious activity](#report-suspicious-activity) | Configure settings that allow users to report fraudulent verification requests. |
| [Notifications](#notifications) | Enable notifications of events from MFA Server. |
| [OATH tokens](concept-authentication-oath-tokens.md) | Used in cloud-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication environments to manage OATH tokens for users. |
| [Phone call settings](#phone-call-settings) | Configure settings related to phone calls and greetings for cloud and on-premises environments. |
| Providers | This will show any existing authentication providers that you've associated with your account. Adding new providers is disabled as of September 1, 2018. |

## Account lockout (MFA Server only)

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

>[!NOTE]
>Account lockout only affects users who sign in by using MFA Server on-premises. 

To prevent repeated MFA attempts as part of an attack, the account lockout settings let you specify how many failed attempts to allow before the account becomes locked out for a period of time. The account lockout settings are applied only when a PIN code is entered for the MFA prompt by using MFA Server on-premises.

The following settings are available:

* Number of MFA denials that trigger account lockout
* Minutes until account lockout counter is reset
* Minutes until account is automatically unblocked

To configure account lockout settings, complete these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an administrator.
1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Account lockout**.
1. Enter the values for your environment, and then select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot that shows the account lockout settings in the Azure portal.](./media/howto-mfa-mfasettings/account-lockout-settings.png)

## Block and unblock users

If a user's device is lost or stolen, you can block Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication attempts for the associated account. Any Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication attempts for blocked users are automatically denied. Users remain blocked for 90 days from the time that they're blocked. For a video that explains how to do this, see [how to block and unblock users in your tenant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdeE1On4S1o).

### Block a user

To block a user, complete the following steps. 

[Watch a short video that describes this process.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdeE1On4S1o&feature=youtu.be)

1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Block/unblock users**.
1. Select **Add** to block a user.
1. Enter the user name for the blocked user in the format `username@domain.com`, and then provide a comment in the **Reason** box.
1. Select **OK** to block the user.

### Unblock a user

To unblock a user, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Block/unblock users**.
1. In the **Action** column next to the user, select **Unblock**.
1. Enter a comment in the **Reason for unblocking** box.
1. Select **OK** to unblock the user.

## Report suspicious activity

**Report suspicious activity**, the updated **MFA Fraud Alert** feature, is now available. When an unknown and suspicious MFA prompt is received, users can report the fraud attempt by using Microsoft Authenticator or through their phone. These alerts are integrated with [Identity Protection](../identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md) for more comprehensive coverage and capability. 

Users who report an MFA prompt as suspicious are set to **High User Risk**. Administrators can use risk-based policies to limit access for these users, or enable self-service password reset (SSPR) for users to remediate problems on their own. If you previously used the **Fraud Alert** automatic blocking feature and don't have an Azure AD P2 license for risk-based policies, you can use risk detection events to identify and disable impacted users and automatically prevent their sign-in. For more information about using risk-based policies, see [Risk-based access policies](../identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies.md).  

To enable **Report suspicious activity** from the Authentication methods **Settings**:   

1. In the Azure portal, click **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Authentication Methods** > **Settings**. 
1. Set **Report suspicious activity** to **Enabled**. The feature remains disabled if you choose **Microsoft managed**. For more information about Microsoft managed values, see [Protecting authentication methods in Azure Active Directory](concept-authentication-default-enablement.md).
1. Select **All users** or a specific group. 
1. Select a **Reporting code**.
1. Click **Save**. 

>[!NOTE]
>If you enable **Report suspicious activity** and specify a custom voice reporting value while the tenant still has **Fraud Alert** enabled in parallel with a custom voice reporting number configured, the **Report suspicious activity** value will be used instead of **Fraud Alert**.

### View suspicious activity events 

When a user reports a MFA prompt as suspicious, the event shows up in the Sign-ins report (as a sign-in that was rejected by the user), in the Audit logs, and in the Risk detections report.   

- To view the risk detections report, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Identity Protection** > **Risk detection**.  The risk event is part of the standard **Risk Detections** report, and will appear as Detection Type **User Reported Suspicious Activity**, Risk level **High**, Source **End user reported**. 

- To view fraud reports in the Sign-ins report, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-in logs** > **Authentication Details**. The fraud report is part of the standard **Azure AD Sign-ins** report and appears in the Result Detail as MFA denied, Fraud Code Entered. 

- To view fraud reports in the Audit logs, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Audit logs**. The fraud report appears under Activity type Fraud reported - user is blocked for MFA or Fraud reported - no action taken based on the tenant-level settings for fraud report.  

### Manage suspicious activity events 

Once a user has reported a prompt as suspicious, the risk should be investigated and remediated with [Identity Protection](../identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-remediate-unblock.md). 

### Report suspicious activity and fraud alert 

**Report suspicious activity** and the legacy **Fraud Alert** implementation can operate in parallel. You can keep your tenant-wide **Fraud Alert** functionality in place while you start to use **Report suspicious activity** with a targeted test group. 

If **Fraud Alert** is enabled with Automatic Blocking, and **Report suspicious activity** is enabled, the user will be added to the blocklist and set as high-risk and in-scope for any other policies configured. These users will need to be removed from the blocklist and have their risk remediated to enable them to sign in with MFA. 

## Notifications

You can configure Azure AD to send email notifications when users report fraud alerts. These notifications are typically sent to identity administrators, because the user's account credentials are likely compromised. The following example shows what a fraud alert notification email looks like:

![Screenshot that shows a fraud alert notification email.](./media/howto-mfa-mfasettings/multi-factor-authentication-fraud-alert-email.png)

To configure fraud alert notifications:

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multi-Factor Authentication** > **Notifications**.
1. Enter the email address to send the notification to.
1. To remove an existing email address, select **...** next to the email address, and then select **Delete**.
1. Select **Save**.

## OATH tokens

Azure AD supports the use of OATH TOTP SHA-1 tokens that refresh codes every 30 or 60 seconds. You can purchase these tokens from the vendor of your choice.

OATH TOTP hardware tokens typically come with a secret key, or seed, pre-programmed in the token. You need to input these keys into Azure AD as described in the following steps. Secret keys are limited to 128 characters, which might not be compatible with all tokens. The secret key can contain only the characters *a-z* or *A-Z* and digits *1-7*. It must be encoded in Base32.

Programmable OATH TOTP hardware tokens that can be reseeded can also be set up with Azure AD in the software token setup flow.

OATH hardware tokens are supported as part of a public preview. For more information about previews, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms).

![Screenshot that shows the OATH tokens section.](media/concept-authentication-methods/mfa-server-oath-tokens-azure-ad.png)

After you acquire tokens, you need to upload them in a comma-separated values (CSV) file format. Include the UPN, serial number, secret key, time interval, manufacturer, and model, as shown in this example:

```csv
upn,serial number,secret key,time interval,manufacturer,model
Helga@contoso.com,1234567,1234567abcdef1234567abcdef,60,Contoso,HardwareKey
```

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to include the header row in your CSV file.

An administrator can sign in to the Azure portal, go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **OATH tokens**, and upload the CSV file.

Depending on the size of the CSV file, it might take a few minutes to process. Select **Refresh** to get the status. If there are any errors in the file, you can download a CSV file that lists them. The field names in the downloaded CSV file are different from those in the uploaded version.

After any errors are addressed, the administrator can activate each key by selecting **Activate** for the token and entering the OTP displayed in the token.

Users can have a combination of up to five OATH hardware tokens or authenticator applications, such as the Microsoft Authenticator app, configured for use at any time. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Make sure to only assign each token to a single user.
>In the future, support for the assignment of a single token to multiple users will stop to prevent a security risk.

## Phone call settings

If users receive phone calls for MFA prompts, you can configure their experience, such as caller ID or the voice greeting they hear.

In the United States, if you haven't configured MFA caller ID, voice calls from Microsoft come from the following numbers. Users with spam filters should exclude these numbers.

Default number: *+1 (855) 330-8653*

The following table lists more numbers for different countries.

> [!NOTE]
> When Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication calls are placed through the public telephone network, sometimes the calls are routed through a carrier that doesn't support caller ID. Because of this, caller ID isn't guaranteed, even though Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication always sends it. This applies both to phone calls and text messages provided by Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication. If you need to validate that a text message is from Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, see [What SMS short codes are used for sending messages?](multi-factor-authentication-faq.yml#what-sms-short-codes-are-used-for-sending-sms-messages-to-my-users-).

To configure your own caller ID number, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Phone call settings**.
1. Set the **MFA caller ID number** to the number you want users to see on their phones. Only US-based numbers are allowed.
1. Select **Save**.

### Custom voice messages

You can use your own recordings or greetings for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication. These messages can be used in addition to the default Microsoft recordings or to replace them.

Before you begin, be aware of the following restrictions:

* The supported file formats are .wav and .mp3.
* The file size limit is 1 MB.
* Authentication messages should be shorter than 20 seconds. Messages that are longer than 20 seconds can cause the verification to fail. If the user doesn't respond before the message finishes, the verification times out.

### Custom message language behavior

When a custom voice message is played to the user, the language of the message depends on the following factors:

* The language of the user.
  * The language detected by the user's browser.
  * Other authentication scenarios might behave differently.
* The language of any available custom messages.
  * This language is chosen by the administrator when a custom message is added.

For example, if there's only one custom message, and it's in German:

* A user who authenticates in the German language will hear the custom German message.
* A user who authenticates in English will hear the standard English message.

### Custom voice message defaults

You can use the following sample scripts to create your own custom messages. These phrases are the defaults if you don't configure your own custom messages.

| Message name | Script |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication successful | Your sign-in was successfully verified. Goodbye. |
| Extension prompt | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to continue. |
| Fraud confirmation | A fraud alert has been submitted. To unblock your account, please contact your company's IT help desk. |
| Fraud greeting (standard) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. If you did not initiate this verification, someone may be trying to access your account. Please press zero pound to submit a fraud alert. This will notify your company's IT team and block further verification attempts. |
| Fraud reported  |  A fraud alert has been submitted. To unblock your account, please contact your company's IT help desk. |
| Activation | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |

| Fraud greeting (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system.  Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. If you did not initiate this verification, someone may be trying to access your account. Please press zero pound to submit a fraud alert. This will notify your company's IT team and block further verification attempts. |
| Retry (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Extension prompt after digits | If already at this extension, press the pound key to continue. |
| Authentication denied | I'm sorry, we cannot sign you in at this time. Please try again later. |
| Activation greeting (standard) | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Activation retry (standard) | Thank you for using the Microsoft sign-in verification system. Please press the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Activation greeting (PIN) | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please enter your PIN followed by the pound key to finish your verification. |
| Extension prompt before digits | Thank you for using Microsoft's sign-in verification system. Please transfer this call to extension \<extension>. |

### Set up a custom message

To use your own custom messages, complete the following steps:

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Phone call settings**.
1. Select **Add greeting**.
1. Choose the **Type** of greeting, such as **Greeting (standard)** or  **Authentication successful**.
1. Select the **Language**. See the previous section on [custom message language behavior](#custom-message-language-behavior).
1. Browse for and select an .mp3 or .wav sound file to upload.
1. Select **Add** and then **Save**.

## MFA service settings

Settings for app passwords, trusted IPs, verification options, and remembering multi-factor authentication on trusted devices are available in the service settings. This is a legacy portal. It isn't part of the regular Azure portal.

You can access service settings from the Azure portal by going to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Getting started** > **Configure** > **Additional cloud-based MFA settings**. A window or tab opens with additional service settings options.

### Trusted IPs

The trusted IPs feature of Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication bypasses multi-factor authentication prompts for users who sign in from a defined IP address range. You can set trusted IP ranges for your on-premises environments. When users are in one of these locations, there's no Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication prompt. The trusted IPs feature requires Azure AD Premium P1 edition. 

> [!NOTE]
> The trusted IPs can include private IP ranges only when you use MFA Server. For cloud-based Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, you can use only public IP address ranges.
>
> IPv6 ranges are supported only in the [Named locations (preview)](../conditional-access/location-condition.md) interface.

If your organization uses the NPS extension to provide MFA to on-premises applications, the source IP address will always appear to be the NPS server that the authentication attempt flows through.

| Azure AD tenant type | Trusted IP feature options |
|:--- |:--- |
| Managed |**Specific range of IP addresses**: Administrators specify a range of IP addresses that can bypass multi-factor authentications for users who sign in from the company intranet. A maximum of 50 trusted IP ranges can be configured.|
| Federated |**All Federated Users**: All federated users who sign in from inside the organization can bypass multi-factor authentications. Users bypass verifications by using a claim that's issued by Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS).<br/>**Specific range of IP addresses**: Administrators specify a range of IP addresses that can bypass multi-factor authentication for users who sign in from the company intranet. |

Trusted IP bypass works only from inside the company intranet. If you select the **All Federated Users** option and a user signs in from outside the company intranet, the user has to authenticate by using multi-factor authentication. The process is the same even if the user presents an AD FS claim.

>[!NOTE]
>If both per-user MFA and Conditional Access policies are configured in the tenant, you will need to add trusted IPs to the Conditional Access policy and update the MFA service settings.

#### User experience inside the corporate network

When the trusted IPs feature is disabled, multi-factor authentication is required for browser flows. App passwords are required for older rich-client applications.

When trusted IPs are used, multi-factor authentication isn't required for browser flows. App passwords aren't required for older rich-client applications if the user hasn't created an app password. After an app password is in use, the password is required.

#### User experience outside the corporate network

Regardless of whether trusted IPs are defined, multi-factor authentication is required for browser flows. App passwords are required for older rich-client applications.

#### Enable named locations by using Conditional Access

You can use Conditional Access rules to define named locations by using the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, and then go to **Security** > **Conditional Access** > **Named locations**.
1. Select **New location**.
1. Enter a name for the location.
1. Select **Mark as trusted location**.
1. Enter the IP range for your environment in CIDR notation. For example, *40.77.182.32/27*.
1. Select **Create**.

#### Enable the trusted IPs feature by using Conditional Access

To enable trusted IPs by using Conditional Access policies, complete the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, and then go to **Security** >  **Conditional Access** > **Named locations**.
1. Select **Configure MFA trusted IPs**.
1. On the **Service Settings** page, under **Trusted IPs**, choose one of these options:

   * **For requests from federated users originating from my intranet**: To choose this option, select the checkbox. All federated users who sign in from the corporate network bypass multi-factor authentications by using a claim that's issued by AD FS. Ensure that AD FS has a rule to add the intranet claim to the appropriate traffic. If the rule doesn't exist, create the following rule in AD FS:

      `c:[Type== "https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2012/01/insidecorporatenetwork"] => issue(claim = c);`

   * **For requests from a specific range of public IPs**: To choose this option, enter the IP addresses in the text box, in CIDR notation.
      * For IP addresses that are in the range *xxx.xxx.xxx*.1 through *xxx.xxx.xxx*.254, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx*.0/24**.
      * For a single IP address, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx*/32**.
      * Enter up to 50 IP address ranges. Users who sign in from these IP addresses bypass multi-factor authentications.

1. Select **Save**.

#### Enable the trusted IPs feature by using service settings

If you don't want to use Conditional Access policies to enable trusted IPs, you can configure the service settings for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by using the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Users**.
1. Select **Per-user MFA**.
1. Under **multi-factor authentication** at the top of the page, select **service settings**.
1. On the **service settings** page, under **Trusted IPs**, choose one or both of the following options:

   * **For requests from federated users on my intranet**: To choose this option, select the checkbox. All federated users who sign in from the corporate network bypass multi-factor authentication by using a claim that's issued by AD FS. Ensure that AD FS has a rule to add the intranet claim to the appropriate traffic. If the rule doesn't exist, create the following rule in AD FS:

      `c:[Type== "https://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2012/01/insidecorporatenetwork"] => issue(claim = c);` 

   * **For requests from a specified range of IP address subnets**: To choose this option, enter the IP addresses in the text box, in CIDR notation.
      * For IP addresses that are in the range *xxx.xxx.xxx*.1 through *xxx.xxx.xxx*.254, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx*.0/24**.
      * For a single IP address, use notation like ***xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx*/32**.
      * Enter up to 50 IP address ranges. Users who sign in from these IP addresses bypass multi-factor authentications.

1. Select **Save**.

### Verification methods

You can choose the verification methods that are available for your users in the service settings portal. When your users enroll their accounts for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, they choose their preferred verification method from the options that you've enabled. Guidance for the user enrollment process is provided in [Set up my account for multi-factor authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-use-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-9783c865-0308-42fb-a519-8cf666fe0acc).

The following verification methods are available:

| Method | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Call to phone |Places an automated voice call. The user answers the call and presses # on the phone to authenticate. The phone number isn't synchronized to on-premises Active Directory. |
| Text message to phone |Sends a text message that contains a verification code. The user is prompted to enter the verification code into the sign-in interface. This process is called one-way SMS. Two-way SMS means that the user must text back a particular code. Two-way SMS is deprecated and not supported after November 14, 2018. Administrators should enable another method for users who previously used two-way SMS.|
| Notification through mobile app |Sends a push notification to the user's phone or registered device. The user views the notification and selects **Verify** to complete verification. The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-authenticator/9nblgggzmcj6), [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), and [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073). |
| Verification code from mobile app or hardware token |The Microsoft Authenticator app generates a new OATH verification code every 30 seconds. The user enters the verification code into the sign-in interface. The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-authenticator/9nblgggzmcj6), [Android](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), and [iOS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073). |

For more information, see [What authentication and verification methods are available in Azure AD?](concept-authentication-methods.md).

#### Enable and disable verification methods

To enable or disable verification methods, complete the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Users**.
1. Select **Per-user MFA**.
1. Under **multi-factor authentication** at the top of the page, select **service settings**.
1. On the **service settings** page, under **verification options**, select or clear the appropriate checkboxes.
1. Select **Save**.

### Remember multi-factor authentication

 The **remember multi-factor authentication** feature lets users bypass subsequent verifications for a specified number of days, after they've successfully signed in to a device by using MFA. To enhance usability and minimize the number of times a user has to perform MFA on a given device, select a duration of 90 days or more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for trusted devices can affect security. If a corporate account becomes compromised or a trusted device is lost or stolen, you should [Revoke MFA Sessions](howto-mfa-userdevicesettings.md).

> The revoke action revokes the trusted status from all devices, and the user is required to perform multi-factor authentication again. You can also instruct your users to restore the original MFA status on their own devices as noted in [Manage your settings for multi-factor authentication](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/change-your-two-step-verification-method-and-settings-c801d5ad-e0fc-4711-94d5-33ad5d4630f7#turn-on-two-factor-verification-prompts-on-a-trusted-device).

#### How the feature works

The **remember multi-factor authentication** feature sets a persistent cookie on the browser when a user selects the **Don't ask again for *X* days** option at sign-in. The user isn't prompted again for MFA from that browser until the cookie expires. If the user opens a different browser on the same device or clears the cookies, they're prompted again to verify.

The **Don't ask again for *X* days** option isn't shown on non-browser applications, regardless of whether the app supports modern authentication. These apps use _refresh tokens_ that provide new access tokens every hour. When a refresh token is validated, Azure AD checks that the last multi-factor authentication occurred within the specified number of days.

The feature reduces the number of authentications on web apps, which normally prompt every time. The feature can increase the number of authentications for modern authentication clients that normally prompt every 180 days, if a lower duration is configured. It might also increase the number of authentications when combined with Conditional Access policies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **remember multi-factor authentication** feature isn't compatible with the **keep me signed in** feature of AD FS, when users perform multi-factor authentication for AD FS through MFA Server or a third-party multi-factor authentication solution.
>
> If your users select **keep me signed in** on AD FS and also mark their device as trusted for MFA, the user isn't automatically verified after the **remember multi-factor authentication** number of days expires. Azure AD requests a fresh multi-factor authentication, but AD FS returns a token with the original MFA claim and date, rather than performing multi-factor authentication again. *This reaction sets off a verification loop between Azure AD and AD FS.*

#### Enable remember multi-factor authentication

To enable and configure the option to allow users to remember their MFA status and bypass prompts, complete the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure Active Directory**, and then select **Users**.
1. Select **Per-user MFA**.
1. Under **multi-factor authentication** at the top of the page, select **service settings**.
1. On the **service settings** page, under **remember multi-factor authentication**, select **Allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices they trust**.
1. Set the number of days to allow trusted devices to bypass multi-factor authentications. For the optimal user experience, extend the duration to 90 or more days.
1. Select **Save**.

#### Mark a device as trusted

After you enable the **remember multi-factor authentication** feature, users can mark a device as trusted when they sign in by selecting **Don't ask again**.
