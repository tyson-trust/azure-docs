# Azure AD certificate-based authentication technical deep dive

This article explains how Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) certificate-based authentication (CBA) works, and dives into technical details on Azure AD CBA configurations.

## How does Azure AD certificate-based authentication work?

The following image describes what happens when a user tries to sign in to an application in a tenant where Azure AD CBA is enabled.

:::image type="content" border="false" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/how-it-works.png" alt-text="Illustration with steps about how Azure AD certificate-based authentication works." :::

Now we'll walk through each step:

1. The user tries to access an application, such as [MyApps portal](https://myapps.microsoft.com/).
1. If the user isn't already signed in, the user is redirected to the Azure AD **User Sign-in** page at [https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/).
1. The user enters their username into the Azure AD sign-in page, and then clicks **Next**. Azure AD does home realm discovery using the tenant name and the username is used to look up the user in Azure AD tenant.
   
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sign-in for MyApps portal.":::
  
1. Azure AD checks whether CBA is enabled for the tenant. If CBA is enabled, the user sees a link to **Use a certificate or smartcard** on the password page. If the user doesn't see the sign-in link, make sure CBA is enabled on the tenant. For more information, see [How do I enable Azure AD CBA?](./certificate-based-authentication-faq.yml#how-can-an-administrator-enable-azure-ad-cba-).
   
   >[!NOTE]
   > If CBA is enabled on the tenant, all users will see the link to **Use a certificate or smart card** on the password page. However, only the users in scope for CBA will be able to authenticate successfully against an application that uses Azure AD as their Identity provider (IdP).

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Use a certificate or smart card.":::

   If you enabled other authentication methods like **Phone sign-in** or **FIDO2**, users may see a different sign-in screen.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in-alt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sign-in if FIDO2 is also enabled.":::

1. Once the user selects certificate-based authentication, the client is redirected to the certauth endpoint, which is [https://certauth.login.microsoftonline.com](https://certauth.login.microsoftonline.com) for Azure Global. For [Azure Government](../../azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure.md#guidance-for-developers), the certauth endpoint is [https://certauth.login.microsoftonline.us](https://certauth.login.microsoftonline.us).  

   The endpoint performs TLS mutual authentication, and requests the client certificate as part of the TLS handshake. You'll see an entry for this request in the Sign-ins log.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Sign-ins log in Azure AD." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in-log.png":::
   
   >[!NOTE]
   >The network administrator should allow access to the User sign-in page and certauth endpoint for the customer’s cloud environment. Disable TLS inspection on the certauth endpoint to make sure the client certificate request succeeds as part of the TLS handshake.

   Click the log entry to bring up **Activity Details** and click **Authentication Details**. You'll see an entry for the X.509 certificate.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/entry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the entry for X.509 certificate.":::

1. Azure AD will request a client certificate, the user picks the client certificate, and clicks **Ok**.

   >[!NOTE] 
   >Trusted CA hints are not supported, so the list of certificates can't be further scoped. We're looking into adding this functionality in the future.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/cert-picker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the certificate picker." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/cert-picker.png":::

1. Azure AD verifies the certificate revocation list to make sure the certificate isn't revoked and is valid. Azure AD identifies the user by using the [username binding configured](how-to-certificate-based-authentication.md#step-4-configure-username-binding-policy) on the tenant to map the certificate field value to the user attribute value.
1. If a unique user is found with a Conditional Access policy that requires multifactor authentication (MFA), and the [certificate authentication binding rule](how-to-certificate-based-authentication.md#step-3-configure-authentication-binding-policy) satisfies MFA, then Azure AD signs the user in immediately. If MFA is required but the certificate satisfies only a single factor, either passwordless sign-in or FIDO2 will be offered as a second factor if they are already registered.
1. Azure AD completes the sign-in process by sending a primary refresh token back to indicate successful sign-in.
1. If the user sign-in is successful, the user can access the application.

## Certificate-based authentication is MFA capable

Azure AD CBA is an MFA (Multi factor authentication) capable method, that is Azure AD CBA can be either Single (SF) or Multi-factor (MF) depending on the tenant configuration. Enabling CBA for a user indicates the user is potentially capable of MFA. This means a user may need additional configuration to get MFA and proof up to register other authentication methods when the user is in scope for CBA.

If CBA enabled user only has a Single Factor (SF) certificate and need MFA
   1. Use Password + SF certificate.
   1. Issue Temporary Access Pass (TAP)
   1. Admin adds Phone Number to user account and allows Voice/SMS method for user.

If CBA enabled user has not yet been issued a certificate and need MFA
   1. Issue Temporary Access Pass (TAP)
   1. Admin adds Phone Number to user account and allows Voice/SMS method for user.

If CBA enabled user cannot use MF cert (such as on mobile device without smart card support) and need MFA
   1. Issue Temporary Access Pass (TAP)
   1. User Register another MFA method (when user can use MF cert)
   1. Use Password + MF cert (when user can use MF cert)
   1. Admin adds Phone Number to user account and allows Voice/SMS method for user


## MFA with Single-factor certificate-based authentication

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

Azure AD CBA can be used as a second factor to meet MFA requirements with single-factor certificates. 
Some of the supported combinations are

1. CBA (first factor) + passwordless phone sign-in (PSI as second factor)
1. CBA (first factor) + FIDO2 security keys (second factor) 
1. Password (first factor) + CBA (second factor) 

Users need to have another way to get MFA and register passwordless sign-in or FIDO2 in advance to signing in with Azure AD CBA.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>A user will be considered MFA capable when a user is in scope for Certificate-based authentication auth method. This means user will not be able to use proof up as part of their authentication to registerd other available methods. Make sure users who do not have a valid certificate are not part of CBA auth method scope. More info on [Azure AD MFA](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md)

**Steps to set up passwordless phone signin(PSI) with CBA**

For passwordless sign-in to work, users should disable legacy notification through mobile app.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Follow the steps at [Enable passwordless phone sign-in authentication](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-phone.md#enable-passwordless-phone-sign-in-authentication-methods)

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >In the above configuration under step 4, please choose **Passwordless** option. Change the mode for each groups added for PSI for **Authentication mode**, choose **Passwordless** for passwordless sign-in to work with CBA. If the admin configures "Any", CBA + PSI will not work.

1. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Multifactor authentication** > **Additional cloud-based multifactor authentication settings**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to configure multifactor authentication settings.":::

1. Under **Verification options**, clear the **Notification through mobile app** checkbox and click **Save**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/clear-notification.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to remove notification through mobile app.":::

## MFA authentication flow using single factor certificates and passwordless sign in

Let's look at an example of a user who has single factor certificates and has configured passwordless sign in. 

1. Enter your User Principal Name (UPN) and click **Next**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/user-principal-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to enter a user principal name.":::

1. Select **Sign in with a certificate**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to sign in with a certificate.":::

   If you enabled other authentication methods like Phone sign-in or FIDO2 security keys, users may see a different sign-in screen.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/sign-in-alt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of alternate way to sign in with a certificate.":::

1. Pick the correct user certificate in the client certificate picker and click **OK**.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/cert-picker.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to select a certificate.":::

1. Because the certificate is configured to be single-factor authentication strength, the user needs a second factor to meet MFA requirements. The user will see available second factors, which in this case is passwordless sign-in. Select **Approve a request on my Microsoft Authenticator app**.
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/second-factor-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot of second factor request.":::

1. You'll get a notification on your phone. Select **Approve Sign-in?**.
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/approve.png" alt-text="Screenshot of approval request.":::

1. Enter the number you see on the browser or app screen into Microsoft Authenticator.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/number.png" alt-text="Screenshot of number match.":::

1. Select **Yes** and user will be authenticated and signed in.

## Understanding the authentication binding policy

The authentication binding policy helps determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multifactor. An administrator can change the default value from single factor to multifactor, or set up custom policy configurations either by using issuer subject or policy OID fields in the certificate.

### Certificate strengths

An admin can determine whether the certificates are single-factor or multifactor strength. For more information, see the documentation that maps [NIST Authentication Assurance Levels to Azure AD Auth Methods](https://aka.ms/AzureADNISTAAL), which builds upon [NIST 800-63B SP 800-63B, Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Mgmt](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-63b/final).

### Multifactor certificate authentication 

When a user has a multifactor certificate, they can perform multifactor authentication only with certificates. However, the tenant admin should make sure the certificates are protected with a PIN or hardware module to be considered multifactor.

### How Azure AD resolves multiple authentication policy binding rules

Because multiple authentication binding policy rules can be created with different certificate fields, there are some rules that determine the authentication protection level. They are as follows:

1. Exact match is used for strong authentication by using policy OID. If you have a certificate A with policy OID **1.2.3.4.5** and a derived credential B based on that certificate has a policy OID **1.2.3.4.5.6**, and the custom rule is defined as **Policy OID** with value **1.2.3.4.5** with MFA, only certificate A will satisfy MFA, and credential B will satisfy only single-factor authentication. If the user used derived credential during sign-in and was configured to have MFA, the user will be asked for a second factor for successful authentication.
1. Policy OID rules will take precedence over certificate issuer rules. If a certificate has both policy OID and Issuer, the policy OID is always checked first, and if no policy rule is found then the issuer subject bindings are checked. Policy OID has a higher strong authentication binding priority than the issuer.
1. If one CA binds to MFA, all user certificates that the CA issues qualify as MFA. The same logic applies for single-factor authentication.
1. If one policy OID binds to MFA, all user certificates that include this policy OID as one of the OIDs (A user certificate could have multiple policy OIDs) qualify as MFA.
1. If there's a conflict between multiple policy OIDs (such as when a certificate has two policy OIDs, where one binds to single-factor authentication and the other binds to MFA) then treat the certificate as a single-factor authentication.
1. One certificate can only have one valid strong authentication binding (that is, a certificate can't bind to both single-factor and MFA).

## Understanding the username binding policy

The username binding policy helps validate the certificate of the user. By default, Subject Alternate Name (SAN) Principal Name in the certificate is mapped to UserPrincipalName attribute of the user object to determine the user.

### Achieve higher security with certificate bindings

There are four supported methods. In general, mapping types are considered high-affinity if they're based on identifiers that you can't reuse (Such as Subject Key Identifiers or SHA1 Public Key). These identifiers convey a higher assurance that only a single certificate can be used to authenticate the respective user. Therefore, all mapping types based on usernames and email addresses are considered low-affinity. Therefore, Azure AD implements two mappings considered low-affinity (based on reusable identifiers), and the other two are considered high-affinity bindings. For more information, see [certificateUserIds](concept-certificate-based-authentication-certificateuserids.md). 

|Certificate mapping Field | Examples of values in certificateUserIds | User object attributes | Type | 
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|----------|
|PrincipalName | “X509:\<PN>bob@woodgrove.com” | userPrincipalName <br> onPremisesUserPrincipalName <br> certificateUserIds | low-affinity |
|RFC822Name	| “X509:\<RFC822>user@woodgrove.com” | userPrincipalName <br> onPremisesUserPrincipalName <br> certificateUserIds | low-affinity |
|X509SKI | “X509:\<SKI>123456789abcdef”| certificateUserIds | high-affinity |
|X509SHA1PublicKey |“X509:\<SHA1-PUKEY>123456789abcdef” | certificateUserIds | high-affinity |

### How Azure AD resolves multiple username policy binding rules

Use the highest priority (lowest number) binding.

1. Look up the user object by using the username or User Principal Name.
1. If the X.509 certificate field is on the presented certificate, Azure AD will match the value in the certificate field to the user object attribute value.
   1. If a match is found, user authentication is successful.
   1. If a match isn't found, move to the next priority binding.
1. If the X.509 certificate field isn't on the presented certificate, move to the next priority binding.
1. Validate all the configured username bindings until one of them results in a match and user authentication is successful.
1. If a match isn't found on any of the configured username bindings, user authentication fails.

## Securing Azure AD configuration with multiple username bindings

Each of the Azure AD attributes (userPrincipalName, onPremiseUserPrincipalName, certificateUserIds) available to bind certificates to Azure AD user accounts has unique constraint to ensure a certificate only matches a single Azure AD user account. However, Azure AD CBA does support configuring multiple binding methods in the username binding policy. This allows an administrator to accommodate multiple certificate configurations. However the combination of some methods can also potentially permit one certificate to match to multiple Azure AD user accounts. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When using multiple bindings, Azure AD CBA authentication is only as secure as your low-affinity binding as Azure AD CBA will validate each of the bindings to authenticate the user. In order to eliminate a scenario where a single certificate matching multiple Azure AD accounts, the tenant administrator should:
>- Configure a single binding method in the username binding policy.
>- If a tenant has multiple binding methods configured and doesn't want to allow one certificate to multiple accounts, the tenant admin must ensure all allowable methods configured in the policy map to the same Azure AD Account, i.e all user accounts should have values matching all the bindings.
>- If a tenant has multiple binding methods configured, the admin should make sure that they do not have more than one low-affinity binding 

For example, if the tenant admin has two username bindings on PrincipalName mapped to Azure AD UPN and SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKI) to certificateUserIds and wants a certificate to only be used for a single Azure AD Account, the admin must make sure that account has the UPN that is present in the certificate and implements the SKI mapping in the same account certificateUserId attribute.

Here's an example of potential values for UPN and certificateUserIDs:

Azure AD User Principal Name = Bob.Smith@Contoso.com <br>
certificateUserIDs = [x509:\<SKI>89b0f468c1abea65ec22f0a882b8fda6fdd6750p]<br>

Having both PrincipalName and SKI values from the user's certificate mapped to the same account ensures that while the tenant policy permits mapping PrincipalName to Azure AD UPN & SKI values in certificateUserIds, that certificate can only match a single Azure AD account. With unique constraint on both UserPrincipalName and certificateUserIds, no other user account can have the same values and can't successfully authenticate with the same certificate. 

## Understanding the certificate revocation process

The certificate revocation process allows the admin to revoke a previously issued certificate from being used for future authentication. The certificate revocation won't revoke already issued tokens of the user. Follow the steps to manually revoke tokens at [Configure revocation](./certificate-based-authentication-federation-get-started.md#step-3-configure-revocation).

Azure AD downloads and caches the customers certificate revocation list (CRL) from their certificate authority to check if certificates are revoked during the authentication of the user.

An admin can configure the CRL distribution point during the setup process of the trusted issuers in the Azure AD tenant. Each trusted issuer should have a CRL that can be referenced by using an internet-facing URL.
 
>[!IMPORTANT]
>The maximum size of a CRL for Azure AD to successfully download on an interactive sign-in and cache is 20 MB in Azure Global and 45 MB in Azure US Government clouds, and the time required to download the CRL must not exceed 10 seconds. If Azure AD can't download a CRL, certificate-based authentications using certificates issued by the corresponding CA will fail. As a best practice to keep CRL files within size limits, keep certificate lifetimes within reasonable limits and to clean up expired certificates. For more information, see [Is there a limit for CRL size?](certificate-based-authentication-faq.yml#is-there-a-limit-for-crl-size-).

When a user performs an interactive sign-in with a certificate, and the CRL exceeds the interactive limit for a cloud, their initial sign-in will fail with the following error:

"The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) downloaded from {uri} has exceeded the maximum allowed size ({size} bytes) for CRLs in Azure Active Directory. Try again in few minutes. If the issue persists, contact your tenant administrators."

After the error, Azure AD will attempt to download the CRL subject to the service-side limits (45 MB in Azure Global and 150 MB in Azure US Government clouds).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the admin skips the configuration of the CRL, Azure AD will not perform any CRL checks during the certificate-based authentication of the user. This can be helpful for initial troubleshooting, but shouldn't be considered for production use.

As of now, we don't support Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) because of performance and reliability reasons. Instead of downloading the CRL at every connection by the client browser for OCSP, Azure AD downloads once at the first sign-in and caches it, thereby improving the performance and reliability of CRL verification. We also index the cache so the search is much faster every time. Customers must publish CRLs for certificate revocation.

The following steps are a typical flow of the CRL check:

1. Azure AD will attempt to download the CRL at the first sign-in event of any user with a certificate of the corresponding trusted issuer or certificate authority. 
1. Azure AD will cache and re-use the CRL for any subsequent usage. It will honor the **Next update date** and, if available, **Next CRL Publish date** (used by Windows Server CAs) in the CRL document.
1. The user certificate-based authentication will fail if:
   - A CRL has been configured for the trusted issuer and Azure AD can't download the CRL, due to availability, size, or latency constraints.
   - The user's certificate is listed as revoked on the CRL.
   
     :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/user-cert.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the revoked user certificate in the CRL." :::  

   - Azure AD will attempt to download a new CRL from the distribution point if the cached CRL document is expired. 

>[!NOTE]
>Azure AD will check the CRL of the issuing CA and other CAs in the PKI trust chain up to the root CA. We have a limit of up to 10 CAs from the leaf client certificate for CRL validation in the PKI chain. The limitation is to make sure a bad actor will not bring down the service by uploading a PKI chain with a huge number of CAs with a bigger CRL size.
If the tenant’s PKI chain has more than 5 CAs and in case of a CA compromise, the administrator should remove the compromised trusted issuer from the Azure AD tenant configuration.
 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Due to the nature of CRL caching and publishing cycles, it is highly recommended in case of a certificate revocation to also revoke all sessions of the affected user in Azure AD.

As of now, there's no way for the administrator to manually force or re-trigger the download of the CRL. 

### How to configure revocation

[!INCLUDE [Configure revocation](../../../includes/active-directory-authentication-configure-revocation.md)]

## Understanding Sign-in logs

Sign-in logs provide information about sign-ins and how your resources are used by your users. For more information about sign-in logs, see [Sign-in logs in Azure Active Directory](../reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins.md).

Let's walk through two scenarios, one where the certificate satisfies single-factor authentication and another where the certificate satisfies MFA.

For the test scenarios, choose a user with a Conditional Access policy that requires MFA. 
Configure the user binding policy by mapping SAN Principal Name to UserPrincipalName.

The user certificate should be configured like this screenshot:

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/user-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the user certificate." :::  

### Test single-factor authentication 

For the first test scenario, configure the authentication policy where the Issuer subject rule satisfies single-factor authentication.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/single-factor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Authentication policy configuration showing single-factor authentication required." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/single-factor.png":::  

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the test user by using CBA. The authentication policy is set where Issuer subject rule satisfies single-factor authentication.
1. After sign-in was succeeds, click **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-in logs**.

   Let's look closer at some of the entries you can find in the **Sign-in logs**.

   The first entry requests the X.509 certificate from the user. The status **Interrupted** means that Azure AD validated that CBA is enabled in the tenant and a certificate is requested for authentication.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/entry-one.png" alt-text="Screenshot of single-factor authentication entry in the sign-in logs." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/entry-one.png":::  

   The **Activity Details** shows this is just part of the expected login flow where the user selects a certificate. 
   
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/cert-activity-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of activity details in the sign-in logs." :::  

   The **Additional Details** show the certificate information.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/additional-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of multifactor additional details in the sign-in logs." :::  

   These additional entries show that the authentication is complete, a primary refresh token is sent back to the browser, and user is given access to the resource.

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/refresh-token.png" alt-text="Screenshot of refresh token entry in the sign-in logs." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/refresh-token.png":::  

### Test multifactor authentication

For the next test scenario, configure the authentication policy where the **policyOID** rule satisfies multifactor authentication.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/multifactor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Authentication policy configuration showing multifactor authentication required." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/multifactor.png":::  

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using CBA. Since the policy was set to satisfy multifactor authentication, the user sign-in is successful without a second factor.
1. Click **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-ins**.

   You'll see several entries in the Sign-in logs, including an entry with **Interrupted** status. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/several-entries.png" alt-text="Screenshot of several entries in the sign-in logs." lightbox="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/several-entries.png":::  

    The **Activity Details** shows this is just part of the expected login flow where the user selects a certificate. 
   
   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/mfacert-activity-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of second-factor sign-in details in the sign-in logs." :::  
   
   The entry with **Interrupted** status has more diagnostic info on the **Additional Details** tab. 

   :::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/interrupted-user-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of interrupted attempt details in the sign-in logs." :::  

   The following table has a description of each field.

   | Field   | Description  |
   |---------|--------------|
   | User certificate subject name | Refers to the subject name field in the certificate. |
   | User certificate binding | Certificate: Principal Name; User Attribute: userPrincipalName; Rank: 1<br>This shows which SAN PrincipalName certificate field was mapped to userPrincipalName user attribute and was priority 1. |
   | User certificate authentication level | multiFactorAuthentication |
   | User certificate authentication level type | PolicyId<br>This shows policy OID was used to determine the authentication strength. |
   | User certificate authentication level identifier | 1.2.3.4<br>This shows the value of the identifier policy OID from the certificate. |

## Understanding the certificate-based authentication error page

Certificate-based authentication can fail for reasons such as the certificate being invalid, or the user selected the wrong certificate or an expired certificate, or because of a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) issue. When certificate validation fails, the user sees this error:

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/validation-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a certificate validation error." :::  

If CBA fails on a browser, even if the failure is because you cancel the certificate picker, you need to close the browser session and open a new session to try CBA again. A new session is required because browsers cache the certificate. When CBA is re-tried, the browser will send the cached certificate during the TLS challenge, which causes sign-in failure and the validation error.
 
Click **More details** to get logging information that can be sent to an administrator, who in turn can get more information from the Sign-in logs.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of error details." :::  

Click **Other ways to sign in** to try other methods available to the user to sign in. 
 
>[!NOTE]
>If you retry CBA in a browser, it'll keep failing due to the browser caching issue. Users need to open a new browser session and sign in again.

:::image type="content" border="true" source="./media/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive/new-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a new sign-in attempt." :::  

## Certificate-based authentication in MostRecentlyUsed (MRU) methods
 
Once a user authenticates successfully using CBA, the user's MostRecentlyUsed (MRU) authentication method will be set to CBA. Next time, when the user enters their UPN and clicks **Next**, the user will be taken to the CBA method directly, and need not select **Use the certificate or smart card**.

To reset the MRU method, the user needs to cancel the certificate picker, click **Other ways to sign in**, and select another method available to the user and authenticate successfully.

## External identity support

An external identity can't perform multifactor authentication (MFA) to the resource tenant with Azure AD CBA. Instead, have the user perform MFA using CBA in the home tenant, and set up cross tenant settings for the resource tenant to trust MFA from the home tenant.
