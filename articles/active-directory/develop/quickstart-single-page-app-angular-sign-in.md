#Customer intent: As an app developer, I want to learn how to get access tokens and refresh tokens by using the Microsoft identity platform so that my JavaScript Angular app can sign in users of personal accounts, work accounts, and school accounts.

# Quickstart: Sign in users in a single-page app (SPA) and call the Microsoft Graph API using Angular

In this quickstart, you download and run a code sample that demonstrates how a JavaScript Angular single-page application (SPA) can sign in users and call Microsoft Graph using the authorization code flow. The code sample demonstrates how to get an access token to call the Microsoft Graph API or any web API.

See [How the sample works](#how-the-sample-works) for an illustration.

This quickstart uses MSAL Angular v2 with the authorization code flow.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create an Azure subscription for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor


## Register and download your quickstart application

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

To start your quickstart application, use either of the following options.

### Option 1 (Express): Register and auto configure your app and then download your code sample

1. Go to the [Azure portal - App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade/quickStartType/AngularSpaQuickstartPage/sourceType/docs) quickstart experience.
1. Enter a name for your application.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Go to the quickstart pane and follow the instructions to download and automatically configure your new application.

### Option 2 (Manual): Register and manually configure your application and code sample

#### Step 1: Register your application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to register the application.
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations** > **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for your application. Users of your app might see this name, and you can change it later.
1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts**.
1. Select **Register**. On the app **Overview** page, note the **Application (client) ID** value for later use.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Authentication**.
1. Under **Platform configurations**, select **Add a platform**. In the pane that opens select **Single-page application**.
1. Set the **Redirect URIs** value to `http://localhost:4200/`. This is the default port NodeJS will listen on your local machine. Weâ€™ll return the authentication response to this URI after successfully authenticating the user.
1. Select **Configure** to apply the changes.
1. Under **Platform Configurations** expand **Single-page application**.
1. Confirm that under **Grant types** ![Already configured](media/quickstart-v2-javascript/green-check.png) Your Redirect URI is eligible for the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.

#### Step 2: Download the project

To run the project with a web server by using Node.js, [download the core project files](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-angular-spa/archive/main.zip).

#### Step 3: Configure your JavaScript app

In the *src* folder, open the *app* folder then open the *app.module.ts* file and update the `clientID`, `authority`, and `redirectUri` values in the `auth` object.

```javascript
// MSAL instance to be passed to msal-angular
export function MSALInstanceFactory(): IPublicClientApplication {
  return new PublicClientApplication({
    auth: {
      clientId: 'Enter_the_Application_Id_Here',
      authority: 'Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here',
      redirectUri: 'Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here'
    },
    cache: {
      cacheLocation: BrowserCacheLocation.LocalStorage,
      storeAuthStateInCookie: isIE, // set to true for IE 11     },
  });
}
```

Modify the values in the `auth` section as described here:

- `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` is the **Application (client) ID** for the application you registered.

   To find the value of **Application (client) ID**, go to the app registration's **Overview** page in the Azure portal.
- `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here` is the instance of the Azure cloud. For the main or global Azure cloud, enter `https://login.microsoftonline.com`. For **national** clouds (for example, China), see [National clouds](authentication-national-cloud.md).
- `Enter_the_Tenant_info_here` is set to one of the following:
  - If your application supports *accounts in this organizational directory*, replace this value with the **Tenant ID** or **Tenant name**. For example, `contoso.microsoft.com`.

   To find the value of the **Directory (tenant) ID**, go to the app registration's **Overview** page in the Azure portal.
  - If your application supports *accounts in any organizational directory*, replace this value with `organizations`.
  - If your application supports *accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts*, replace this value with `common`. **For this quickstart**, use `common`.
  - To restrict support to *personal Microsoft accounts only*, replace this value with `consumers`.

   To find the value of **Supported account types**, go to the app registration's **Overview** page in the Azure portal.
- `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` is `http://localhost:4200/`.

The `authority` value in your *app.module.ts* should be similar to the following if you're using the main (global) Azure cloud:

```javascript
authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common",
```

Scroll down in the same file and update the `graphMeEndpoint`.
- Replace the string `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me` with `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me`
- `Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me` is the endpoint that API calls will be made against. For the main (global) Microsoft Graph API service, enter `https://graph.microsoft.com/` (include the trailing forward-slash). For more information, see the [documentation](/graph/deployments).

```javascript
export function MSALInterceptorConfigFactory(): MsalInterceptorConfiguration {
  const protectedResourceMap = new Map<string, Array<string>>();
  protectedResourceMap.set('Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me', ['user.read']);

  return {
    interactionType: InteractionType.Redirect,
    protectedResourceMap
  };
}
```

 #### Step 4: Run the project

Run the project with a web server by using Node.js:

1. To start the server, run the following commands from within the project directory:
    ```console
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
1. Browse to `http://localhost:4200/`.

1. Select **Login** to start the sign-in process and then call the Microsoft Graph API.

    The first time you sign in, you're prompted to provide your consent to allow the application to access your profile and sign you in. After you're signed in successfully, click the **Profile** button to display your user information on the page.

## More information

### How the sample works

![Diagram showing the authorization code flow for a single-page application.](media/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code/diagram-01-auth-code-flow.png)

### msal.js

The MSAL.js library signs in users and requests the tokens that are used to access an API that's protected by the Microsoft identity platform.

If you have Node.js installed, you can download the latest version by using the Node.js Package Manager (npm):

```console
npm install @azure/msal-browser @azure/msal-angular@2
```
