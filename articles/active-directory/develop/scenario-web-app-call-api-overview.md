# Scenario: A web app that authenticates users and calls web APIs

Learn how to build a web app that signs users in to the Microsoft identity platform, and then calls web APIs on behalf of the signed-in user.

## Prerequisites

This scenario assumes you've already completed [Scenario: Web app that signs in users](scenario-web-app-sign-user-overview.md).

## Overview

You add authentication to your web app so that it can sign users in and call a web API on behalf of the signed-in user.

![Web app that calls web APIs](./media/scenario-webapp/web-app.svg)

Web apps that call web APIs are confidential client applications. That's why they register a secret (an application password or certificate) with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This secret is passed in during the call to Azure AD to get a token.

## Specifics

Adding sign-in to a web app is about protecting the web app itself. That protection is achieved by using *middleware* libraries, not the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL). The preceding scenario, [Web app that signs in users](scenario-web-app-sign-user-overview.md), covered that subject.

This scenario covers how to call web APIs from a web app. You must get access tokens for those web APIs. You use MSAL libraries to acquire these tokens.

Development for this scenario involves;

- Providing a reply URI, secret, or certificate to be shared with Azure AD during [application registration](scenario-web-app-call-api-app-registration.md). If you deploy your app to several locations, you'll provide a reply URI for each location.
- Providing the client credentials in the [application configuration](scenario-web-app-call-api-app-configuration.md). These credentials were shared with Azure AD during application registration.
