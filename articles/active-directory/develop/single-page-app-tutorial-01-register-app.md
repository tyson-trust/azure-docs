# Tutorial: Register a Single-page application with the Microsoft identity platform

To interact with the Microsoft identity platform, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must be made aware of the application you create. This tutorial shows you how to register a single-page application (SPA) in a tenant on the Azure portal.

In this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Register the application in a tenant
> * Add a Redirect URI to the application
> * Record the application's unique identifiers

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* This Azure account must have permissions to manage applications. Any of the following Azure AD roles include the required permissions:
  * Application administrator
  * Application developer
  * Cloud application administrator

## Register the application and record identifiers

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

To complete registration, provide the application a name, specify the supported account types, and add a redirect URI. Once registered, the application **Overview** pane displays the identifiers needed in the application source code.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If access to multiple tenants is available, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which to register the application.
1. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **App registrations > New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application, such as *NewSPA1*.
1. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**. For information on different account types, select the **Help me choose** option.
1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, use the drop-down menu to select **Single-page-application (SPA)** and enter `http://localhost:3000` into the text box.
1. Select **Register**.
