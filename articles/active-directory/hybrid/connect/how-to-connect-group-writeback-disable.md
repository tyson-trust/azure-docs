# Disable group writeback 
This article walks you through disabling group writeback in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect. 

## Disable group writeback by using the wizard

1. Open the Azure AD Connect wizard and go to the **Additional Tasks** page. Select the **Customize synchronization options task**, and then select **Next**. 
2. On the **Optional Features** page, clear the checkbox for group writeback. In the warning that groups will be deleted, select **Yes**. 
 
   > [!IMPORTANT] 
   > Disabling group writeback sets the flags for full import and full synchronization in Active Directory Connect to `true`. It will cause any groups that were previously created by this feature to be deleted from your local Active Directory instance in the next synchronization cycle. 

3. Select **Next**. 
4. Select **Configure**. 


## Disable or roll back group writeback via PowerShell 

1. Open a PowerShell prompt as an administrator. 
2. Disable the sync scheduler after verifying that no synchronization operations are running:

   ``` PowerShell 
   Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $false  
   ``` 
3. Import the ADSync module: 

   ``` PowerShell 
   Import-Module  'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\ADSync\ADSync.psd1' 
   ``` 
4. Disable the group writeback feature for the tenant: 

   ``` PowerShell 
   Set-ADSyncAADCompanyFeature -GroupWritebackV2 $false 
   ``` 
5. Re-enable the sync scheduler:

   ``` PowerShell 
   Set-ADSyncScheduler -SyncCycleEnabled $true  
   ```
