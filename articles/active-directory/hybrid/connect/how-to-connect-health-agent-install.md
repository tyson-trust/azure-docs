# Install the Azure AD Connect Health agents

In this article, you learn how to install and configure the Azure AD Connect Health agents.

Learn how to [download the agents](how-to-connect-install-roadmap.md#download-and-install-azure-ad-connect-health-agent).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD Connect Health is not available in the China sovereign cloud.

## Requirements

The following table lists requirements for using Azure AD Connect Health:

| Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Premium (P1 or P2) Subscription. |Azure AD Connect Health is a feature of Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2). For more information, see [Sign up for Azure AD Premium](../../fundamentals/get-started-premium.md). <br /><br />To start a free 30-day trial, see [Start a trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/). |
| You're a global administrator in Azure AD. |Currently, only Global Administrator accounts can install and configure health agents. For more information, see [Administering your Azure AD directory](../../fundamentals/whatis.md). <br /><br /> By using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC), you can allow other users in your organization to access Azure AD Connect Health. For more information, see [Azure RBAC for Azure AD Connect Health](how-to-connect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-azure-rbac). <br /><br />**Important**: Use a work or school account to install the agents. You can't use a Microsoft account to install the agents. For more information, see [Sign up for Azure as an organization](../../fundamentals/sign-up-organization.md). |
| The Azure AD Connect Health agent is installed on each targeted server. | Health agents must be installed and configured on targeted servers so that they can receive data and provide monitoring and analytics capabilities. <br /><br />For example, to get data from your Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) infrastructure, you must install the agent on the AD FS server and on the Web Application Proxy server. Similarly, to get data from your on-premises Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) infrastructure, you must install the agent on the domain controllers. |
| The Azure service endpoints have outbound connectivity. | During installation and runtime, the agent requires connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. If firewalls block outbound connectivity, add the [outbound connectivity endpoints](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#outbound-connectivity-to-azure-service-endpoints) to an allowlist. |
|Outbound connectivity is based on IP addresses. | For information about firewall filtering based on IP addresses, see [Azure IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519).|
| TLS inspection for outbound traffic is filtered or disabled. | The agent registration step or data upload operations might fail if there's TLS inspection or termination for outbound traffic at the network layer. For more information, see [Set up TLS inspection](/previous-versions/tn-archive/ee796230(v=technet.10)). |
| Firewall ports on the server are running the agent. |The agent requires the following firewall ports to be open so that it can communicate with the Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints: <br />- TCP port 443 <br />- TCP port 5671 <br /><br />The latest version of the agent doesn't require port 5671. Upgrade to the latest version so that only port 443 is required. For more information, see [Hybrid identity required ports and protocols](./reference-connect-ports.md). |
| If Internet Explorer enhanced security is enabled, allow specified websites. |If Internet Explorer enhanced security is enabled, allow the following websites on the server where you install the agent:<br />- `https://login.microsoftonline.com` <br />- `https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com` <br />- `https://login.windows.net` <br />- `https://aadcdn.msftauth.net` <br />- The federation server for your organization that's trusted by Azure AD (for example, `https://sts.contoso.com`). <br /><br />For more information, see [How to configure Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/help/815141/internet-explorer-enhanced-security-configuration-changes-the-browsing). If you have a proxy in your network, see the note that appears at the end of this table.|
| PowerShell version 5.0 or later is installed. | Windows Server 2016 includes PowerShell version 5.0. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows Server Core doesn't support installing the Azure AD Connect Health agent.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a highly locked-down and restricted environment, you need to add more URLs than the URLs the table lists for Internet Explorer enhanced security. Also add URLs that are listed in the table in the next section.

### New versions of the agent and auto upgrade

If a new version of the health agent is released, any existing, installed agents are automatically updated.

<a name="outbound-connectivity-to-the-azure-service-endpoints"></a>

### Outbound connectivity to Azure service endpoints

During installation and runtime, the agent needs connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. If firewalls block outbound connectivity, make sure that the URLs in the following table aren't blocked by default.

Don't disable security monitoring or inspection of these URLs. Instead, allow them as you would allow other internet traffic.

These URLs allow communication with Azure AD Connect Health service endpoints. Later in this article, you'll learn how to [check outbound connectivity](#test-connectivity-to-the-azure-ad-connect-health-service) by using `Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity`.

| Domain environment | Required Azure service endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| General public | - `*.blob.core.windows.net` <br />- `*.aadconnecthealth.azure.com` <br />- `**.servicebus.windows.net` - Port: 5671 (If 5671 is blocked, the agent falls back to 443, but we recommend that you use port 5671. This endpoint isn't required in the latest version of the agent.)<br />- `*.adhybridhealth.azure.com/`<br />- `https://management.azure.com` <br />- `https://policykeyservice.dc.ad.msft.net/` <br />- `https://login.windows.net` <br />- `https://login.microsoftonline.com` <br />- `https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com` <br />- `https://www.office.com` (This endpoint is used only for discovery purposes during registration.)<br />- `https://aadcdn.msftauth.net` <br />- `https://aadcdn.msauth.net` |

## Install the agent for sync

The Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync is installed automatically in the latest version of Azure AD Connect. To use Azure AD Connect for sync, [download the latest version of Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) and install it.

To verify that the agent has been installed, look for the following services on the server. If you completed the configuration, the services should already be running. Otherwise, the services are stopped until the configuration is complete.

- Azure AD Connect Health Sync Insights Service
- Azure AD Connect Health Sync Monitoring Service

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/services.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the running Azure AD Connect Health for sync services on the server.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that you must have Azure AD Premium (P1 or P2) to use Azure AD Connect Health. If you don't have Azure AD Premium, you can't complete the configuration in the Azure portal. For more information, see the [requirements](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#requirements).

## Manually register Azure AD Connect Health for sync

If the Azure AD Connect Health for sync agent registration fails after you successfully install Azure AD Connect, you can use a PowerShell command to manually register the agent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use this PowerShell command only if the agent registration fails after you install Azure AD Connect.

Manually register the Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync by using the following PowerShell command. The Azure AD Connect Health services will start after the agent has been successfully registered.

`Register-AzureADConnectHealthSyncAgent -AttributeFiltering $true -StagingMode $false`

The command takes following parameters:

- `AttributeFiltering`: `$true` (default) if Azure AD Connect isn't syncing the default attribute set and has been customized to use a filtered attribute set. Otherwise, use `$false`.
- `StagingMode`: `$false` (default) if the Azure AD Connect server is *not* in staging mode. If the server is configured to be in staging mode, use `$true`.

When you're prompted for authentication, use the same Global Administrator account (such as `admin@domain.onmicrosoft.com`) that you used to configure Azure AD Connect.

## Install the agent for Azure AD DS

To start the agent installation, double-click the *.exe* file that you downloaded. In the first window, select **Install**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install1.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure AD Connect Health agent for AD DS installation window.":::

When the installation finishes, select **Configure Now**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install2.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the window that finishes the installation of the Azure AD Connect Health agent for Azure AD DS.":::

A Command Prompt window opens. PowerShell runs `Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent`. When you're prompted, sign in to Azure.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install3.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the sign-in window for the Azure AD Connect Health agent for Azure AD DS.":::

After you sign in, PowerShell continues. When it finishes, you can close PowerShell. The configuration is complete.

At this point, the services should be started automatically, allowing the agent to monitor and gather data. If you haven't met all the prerequisites outlined in the previous sections, warnings appear in the PowerShell window. Be sure to complete the [requirements](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) before you install the agent. The following screenshot shows an example of these warnings.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install4.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a warning for the Azure AD Connect Health agent for Azure AD DS configuration.":::

To verify that the agent is installed, look for the following services on the domain controller:

- Azure AD Connect Health AD DS Insights Service
- Azure AD Connect Health AD DS Monitoring Service

If you completed the configuration, these services should already be running. Otherwise, they're stopped until the configuration finishes.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-connect-health-agent-install/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install5.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the running services on the domain controller.":::

### Quickly install the agent on multiple servers

1. Create a user account in Azure AD. Secure the account by using a password.
1. [Assign the Owner role](how-to-connect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-azure-rbac) for this local Azure AD account in Azure AD Connect Health by using the portal. Assign the role to all service instances.
1. Download the *.exe* MSI file in the local domain controller for the installation.
1. Run the following script. Replace the parameters with your new user account and its password.

    ```powershell
    AdHealthAddsAgentSetup.exe /quiet
    Start-Sleep 30
    $userName = "NEWUSER@DOMAIN"
    $secpasswd = ConvertTo-SecureString "PASSWORD" -AsPlainText -Force
    $myCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($userName, $secpasswd)
    import-module "C:\Program Files\Azure Ad Connect Health Adds Agent\PowerShell\AdHealthAdds"
     
    Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent -Credential $myCreds
    ```

When you finish, you can remove access for the local account by completing one or more of the following tasks:

- Remove the role assignment for the local account for Azure AD Connect Health.
- Rotate the password for the local account.
- Disable the Azure AD local account.
- Delete the Azure AD local account.

## Register the agent by using PowerShell

After you install the relevant agent *setup.exe* file, you can register the agent by using the following PowerShell commands, depending on the role. Open PowerShell as administrator and run the relevant command:

```powershell
Register-AzureADConnectHealthADFSAgent
Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent
Register-AzureADConnectHealthSyncAgent
```

> [!NOTE]
> To register against sovereign clouds, use the following command lines:
>
> ```powershell
> Register-AzureADConnectHealthADFSAgent -UserPrincipalName upn-of-the-user
> Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent -UserPrincipalName upn-of-the-user
> Register-AzureADConnectHealthSyncAgent -UserPrincipalName upn-of-the-user
> ```

These commands accept `Credential` as a parameter to complete the registration non-interactively or to complete the registration on a computer that runs Server Core. Keep these factors in mind:

- You can capture `Credential` in a PowerShell variable that's passed as a parameter.
- You can provide any Azure AD identity that has permissions to register the agents, and which does *not* have multifactor authentication enabled.
- By default, global admins have permissions to register the agents. You can also allow less-privileged identities to do this step. For more information, see [Azure RBAC](how-to-connect-health-operations.md#manage-access-with-azure-rbac).

```powershell
    $cred = Get-Credential
    Register-AzureADConnectHealthADFSAgent -Credential $cred

```

## Configure Azure AD Connect Health agents to use HTTP proxy

You can configure Azure AD Connect Health agents to work with an HTTP proxy.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - `Netsh WinHttp set ProxyServerAddress` isn't supported. The agent uses System.Net instead of Windows HTTP Services to make web requests.
> - The configured HTTP proxy address is used to pass through encrypted HTTPS messages.
> - Authenticated proxies (using HTTPBasic) aren't supported.

### Change the agent proxy configuration

To configure the Azure AD Connect Health agent to use an HTTP proxy, you can:

- Import existing proxy settings.
- Specify proxy addresses manually.
- Clear the existing proxy configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> To update the proxy settings, you must restart all Azure AD Connect Health agent services. To restart all the agents, run the following command:
>
> `Restart-Service AdHealthAdfs*`

#### Import existing proxy settings

You can import Internet Explorer HTTP proxy settings so that Azure AD Connect Health agents can use the settings. On each of the servers that run the health agent, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromInternetSettings
```

You can import WinHTTP proxy settings so that the Azure AD Connect Health agents can use them. On each of the servers that run the health agent, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromWinHttp
```

#### Specify proxy addresses manually

You can manually specify a proxy server. On each of the servers that run the health agent, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress address:port
```

Here's an example:

`Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress myproxyserver: 443`

In this example:

- The `address` setting can be a DNS-resolvable server name or an IPv4 address.
- You can omit `port`. If you do, 443 is the default port.

#### Clear the existing proxy configuration

You can clear the existing proxy configuration by running the following command:

```powershell
Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -NoProxy
```

### Read current proxy settings

You can read the current proxy settings by running the following command:

```powershell
Get-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings
```
<a name="test-connectivity-to-azure-ad-connect-health-service"></a>

## Test connectivity to the Azure AD Connect Health service

Occasionally, the Azure AD Connect Health agent loses connectivity with the Azure AD Connect Health service. Causes of this connectivity loss might include network problems, permissions problems, and various other problems.

If the agent can't send data to the Azure AD Connect Health service for longer than two hours, the following alert appears in the portal: **Health Service data is not up to date**.

You can find out whether the affected Azure AD Connect Health agent can upload data to the Azure AD Connect Health service by running the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role ADFS
```

The `Role` parameter currently takes the following values:

- `ADFS`
- `Sync`
- `ADDS`

> [!NOTE]
> To use the connectivity tool, you must first register the agent. If you can't complete the agent registration, make sure that you meet all the [requirements](how-to-connect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) for Azure AD Connect Health. Connectivity is tested by default during agent registration.
