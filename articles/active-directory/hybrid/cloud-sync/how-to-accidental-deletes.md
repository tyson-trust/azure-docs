# Accidental delete prevention

The following document describes the accidental deletion feature for Azure AD Connect cloud sync.  The accidental delete feature is designed to protect you from accidental configuration changes and changes to your on-premises directory that would affect many users and groups.  This feature allows you to:

- configure the ability to prevent accidental deletes automatically. 
- Set the # of objects (threshold) beyond which the configuration takes effect 
- set up a notification email address so they can get an email notification once the sync job in question is put in quarantine for this scenario 

To use this feature, you set the threshold for the number of objects that, if deleted, synchronization should stop.  So if this number is reached, the synchronization stops and a notification is sent to the email that is specified.  This notification allows you to investigate what is going on.

For more information and an example, see the following video.

## Configure accidental delete prevention
To use the new feature, follow the steps below.

 2.  On the left, select **Azure AD Connect**.
 3.  On the left, select **Cloud sync**.
4. Under **Configuration**, select your configuration.
5. Select **View default properties**.
6. Click the pencil next to **Basics**
5. On the right, fill in the following information.
	- **Notification email** - email used for notifications
	- **Prevent accidental deletions** - check this box to enable the feature
	- **Accidental deletion threshold** - enter the number of objects to stop synchronization and send a notification


## Recovering from an accidental delete instance
If you encounter an accidental delete you see this message on the status of your provisioning agent configuration.  It says **Delete threshold exceeded**.

By clicking on **Delete threshold exceeded**, you'll see the sync status info.  This action will provide more details.

Using **View provisioning log**, you can see the **StagedDelete** entries and review the information provided on the users that have been deleted.

### Allowing deletes

The **Allow deletes** action, deletes the objects that triggered the accidental delete threshold.  Use the following procedure to accept these deletes.  

1. Right-click on the ellipses and select **Allow deletes**.
2. Click **Yes** on the confirmation to allow the deletions.

### Rejecting deletions

If you don't want to allow the deletions, you need to do the following actions:
- investigate the source of the deletions
- fix the issue (example, OU was moved out of scope accidentally and you've now readded it back to the scope)
- Run **Restart sync** on the agent configuration
