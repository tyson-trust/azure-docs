Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for customers is designed for flexibility. In addition to the built-in authentication events within a sign-up and sign-in user flow, you can define actions for events at various points within the authentication flow.

Custom authentication extensions in Azure AD let you interact with external systems during a user authentication. The custom authentication extension contains information about your REST API endpoint, the credentials to call the REST API, the attributes that it returns, and when the REST API should be called.

You can create a custom authentication extension using the **OnTokenIssuanceStart** event, which is triggered just before a token is issued to the application:

This article provides an overview of custom authentication extensions in Azure AD for customers.

## Token issuance start event

The token issuance start event is triggered once a user completes all of their authentication challenges, and a security token is about to be issued.

When users authenticate to your application with Azure AD, a security token is returned to your application. The security token contains claims that are statements about the user, such as name, unique identifier, or application roles.  Beyond the default set of claims that are contained in the security token, you can define your own custom claims from external systems using a REST API you develop.  

In some cases, key data might be stored in systems external to Microsoft Entra, such as a secondary email, billing tier, or sensitive information. It's not always feasible for the information in the external system to be stored in the Azure AD directory. For these scenarios, you can use a custom authentication extension and a custom claims provider to add this external data into tokens returned to your application.

A token issuance event extension involves the following components:

- **Custom claims provider**. To customize the token return to your applications, enterprise applications in your Azure AD tenant can configure custom claims provider to fetch data from external systems. The custom claims provider points to a custom extension and specifies the attributes to be added to the security token. Multiple claims provider can share the same custom extension. So, each application can choose its own set of attributes to be added to the security token.

- **REST API endpoint**. When an event fires, Azure AD sends an HTTP request, to your REST API endpoint. The REST API can be an Azure Function, Azure Logic App, or some other publicly available API endpoint. Your REST API endpoint is responsible for interfacing with downstream databases, existing APIs, LDAP directories, or any other stores that contain the attributes you'd like to add to the token configuration.

   The REST API returns an HTTP response, or action, back to Azure AD containing the attributes. Attributes that return by your REST API aren't automatically added to a token. Instead, an application's claims mapping policy must be configured for any attribute to be included in the token.
