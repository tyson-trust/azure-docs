# Tutorial: Prepare your customer tenant to authenticate users in a React single-page app (SPA)

This tutorial series demonstrates how to build a React single-page application (SPA) and prepare it for authentication using the Microsoft Entra admin center. You'll use the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](/javascript/api/overview/msal-overview) library to authenticate your app with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for customers tenant. Finally, you'll run the application and test the sign-in and sign-out experiences.

In this tutorial;

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Register a SPA in the Microsoft Entra admin center, and record its identifiers
> * Define the platform and URLs
> * Grant permissions to the web application to access the Microsoft Graph API
> * Create a sign-in and sign-out user flow in the Microsoft Entra admin center
> * Associate your SPA with the user flow

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- This Azure account must have permissions to manage applications. Any of the following Azure AD roles include the required permissions:

    * Application administrator
    * Application developer
    * Cloud application administrator

- An Azure AD for customers tenant. If you haven't already, [create one now](https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl). You can use an existing customer tenant if you have one.
