# Supported features in Azure Active Directory for customers (preview)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for customers is designed for businesses that want to make applications available to their customers, using the Microsoft Entra platform for identity and access. With the introduction of this feature, Microsoft Entra now offers two different types of tenants that you can create and manage:

- A **workforce tenant** contains your employees and the apps and resources that are internal to your organization. If you've worked with Azure AD, this is the type of tenant you're already familiar with. You might already have an existing workforce tenant for your organization.

- A **customer tenant** represents your customer-facing app, resources, and directory of customer accounts. A customer tenant is distinct and separate from your workforce tenant.

## Compare workforce and customer tenant capabilities

Although workforce tenants and customer tenants are built on the same underlying Microsoft Entra platform, there are some feature differences. The following table compares the features available in each type of tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> During preview, features or capabilities that require a premium license are unavailable in customer tenants.

|Feature  |Workforce tenant  | Customer tenant |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **External Identities** | Invite partners and other external users to your workforce tenant for collaboration. External users become guests in your workforce directory. | Enable self-service sign-up for customers and authorize access to apps. Users are added to your directory as customer accounts.  |
| **Authentication methods and identity providers** | - Azure AD accounts </br>- Microsoft accounts </br>- Email one-time passcode </br>- Google federation</br>- Facebook federation</br>- SAML/WS-Fed federation | - Local account (Email and password)  </br>- Email one-time passcode </br>- Google federation</br>- Facebook federation|
