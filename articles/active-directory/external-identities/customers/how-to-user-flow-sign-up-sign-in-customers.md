# Create a sign-up and sign-in user flow for customers  

You can create a simple sign-up and sign-in experience for your customers by adding a user flow to your application. The user flow defines the series of sign-up steps customers follow and the sign-in methods they can use (such as email and password, one-time passcodes, or social accounts from [Google](how-to-google-federation-customers.md) or [Facebook](how-to-facebook-federation-customers.md)). You can also collect information from customers during sign-up by selecting from a series of built-in user attributes or adding your own custom attributes.

You can create multiple user flows if you have multiple applications that you want to offer to customers. Or, you can use the same user flow for many applications. However, an application can have only one user flow.

## Prerequisites

- **An Azure AD customer tenant**: Before you begin, create your Azure AD customer tenant. You can set up a <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">free trial</a>, or you can create a new customer tenant in Azure AD.
- **Email one-time passcode enabled (optional)**: If you want customers to use their email address and a one-time passcode each time they sign in, make sure Email one-time passcode is enabled at the tenant level (in the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/), navigate to **External Identities** > **All Identity Providers** > **Email One-time-passcode**).
- **Custom attributes defined (optional)**: User attributes are values collected from the user during self-service sign-up. Azure AD comes with a built-in set of attributes, but you can [define custom attributes to collect during sign-up](how-to-define-custom-attributes.md). Define custom attributes in advance so they're available when you set up your user flow. Or you can create and add them later.
- **Identity providers defined (optional)**: You can set up federation with [Google](how-to-google-federation-customers.md) or [Facebook](how-to-facebook-federation-customers.md) in advance, and then select them as sign-in options as you create the user flow.

## Create and customize a user flow

Follow these steps to create a user flow a customer can use to sign in or sign up for an application. These steps describe how to add a new user flow, select the attributes you want to collect, and change the order of the attributes on the sign-up page.

### To add a new user flow

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the **Directories + subscriptions** filter :::image type="icon" source="media/common/portal-directory-subscription-filter.png" border="false"::: in the top menu to switch to your customer tenant.

1. In the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory** > **External Identities** > **User flows**.

1. Select **New user flow**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers/new-user-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new user flow option.":::

1. On the **Create** page, enter a **Name** for the user flow (for example, "SignUpSignIn").

1. Under **Identity providers**, select the **Email Accounts** check box, and then select one of these options:

   - **Email with password**: Allows new users to sign up and sign in using an email address as the sign-in name and a password as their first-factor authentication method. You can also configure options for showing, hiding, or customizing the self-service password reset link on the sign-in page ([learn more](how-to-customize-branding-customers.md#to-customize-self-service-password-reset)).

   - **Email one-time passcode**: Allows new users to sign up and sign in using an email address as the sign-in name and email one-time passcode as their first-factor authentication method.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Azure Active Directory Sign up** option is unavailable because although customers can sign up for a local account using an email from another Azure AD organization, Azure AD federation isn't used to authenticate them. **[Google](how-to-google-federation-customers.md)** and **[Facebook](how-to-facebook-federation-customers.md)** become available only after you set up federation with them. [Learn more about authentication methods and identity providers](concept-authentication-methods-customers.md).

1. Under **User attributes**, choose the attributes you want to collect from the user during sign-up.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers/user-attributes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the user attribute options on the Create a user flow page." lightbox="media/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers/user-attributes.png":::

1. Select **Show more** to choose from the full list of attributes, including **Job Title**, **Display Name**, and **Postal Code**.

   This list also includes any [custom attributes you defined](how-to-define-custom-attributes.md). Select the checkbox next to each attribute you want to collect from the user during sign-up

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers/user-attributes-show-more.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the user attribute pane after selecting Show more." lightbox="media/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers/user-attributes-show-more.png":::

1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Create** to create the user flow.

### To select the layout of the attribute collection page (optional)

You can choose the order in which the attributes are displayed on the sign-up page.

1. In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/), select **Azure Active Directory**.

1. In the left pane, select **Azure Active Directory** > **External Identities** > **User flows**.

1. From the list, select your user flow.

1. Under **Customize**, select **Page layouts**.

   The attributes you chose to collect are listed. You can change the attribute label, type, and whether itâ€™s required. You can also change the order of display by selecting an attribute, and then select **Move up**, **Move down**, **Move to the top**, or **Move to the bottom**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers/page-layouts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of page layout options for a user flow.":::

1. Select **Save**.
