# Sign in users in your own Node.js browserless application - Prepare your tenant

In this article, you prepare your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for customers tenant for authentication. To prepare your tenant, you do the following tasks:

- Register a browserless application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. 

- Create a sign in and sign out user flow in Microsoft Entra admin center.

- Associate your browserless application with the user flow. 

After you complete the tasks, you'll collect an *Application (client) ID* and a *Directory (tenant) ID*.

If you've already registered a browserless application in the Microsoft Entra admin center, and associated it with a user flow, you can skip the steps in this article and move to [Prepare your Node.js browserless app](how-to-browserless-app-node-sign-in-prepare-app.md).

## Register the application

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-register-app](./includes/register-app/register-client-app-common.md)]
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-enable-public-client-flow](./includes/register-app/enable-public-client-flow.md)]  

## Grant API permissions

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-grant-delegated-permissions](./includes/register-app/grant-api-permission-sign-in.md)] 

## Create a user flow 

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/create-sign-in-sign-out-user-flow.md)] 

## Associate the browserless application with the user flow

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-app-integration-add-user-flow](./includes/configure-user-flow/add-app-user-flow.md)]
