# Sign in users in your own Node.js browserless application using the Device Code flow - Overview

In this article, you learn how to build a Node.js browserless application that signs in users. The client application you build uses the [OAuth 2.0 device code flow](../../develop/v2-oauth2-device-code.md) to sign in users interactively, using another device such as a mobile phone.

We've organized the content into three separate articles so it's easy for you to follow: 

- [Prepare your Azure AD for customers tenant](how-to-browserless-app-node-sign-in-prepare-tenant.md) tenant guides you how to register your app and configure user flows in the Microsoft Entra admin center.
- [Prepare your Node.js browserless application](how-to-browserless-app-node-sign-in-prepare-app.md) guides you how to set up your Node.js app structure.
- [Add sign-in and sign-out](how-to-browserless-app-node-sign-in-sign-out.md) guides you how to add authentication support to your application using MSAL Node. 

## Overview

The device code flow is an OAuth2.0 grant flow that allows users to sign in to input-constrained devices like smart TVs, IoT devices, and printers. In a typical interactive authentication experience, Azure AD for customers requires a web browser for user sign-in. In our browserless application scenario, the app uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Node](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) to obtain tokens through a flow that involves the following steps:

1. The application receives a code from the authorization server that is used to initiate authentication.
1. The application prompts the user to use another device and navigate to a URL (for instance, https://microsoft.com/devicelogin), where they're prompted to enter the code.
1. That URL leads the user through a normal authentication experience, including consent prompts and multi-factor authentication if necessary.
1. Upon successful authentication, the app receives the required tokens through a back channel to enable it to perform the web API calls it needs. 

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or another code editor.

- Azure AD for customers tenant. If you don't already have one, <a href="https://aka.ms/ciam-free-trial?wt.mc_id=ciamcustomertenantfreetrial_linkclick_content_cnl" target="_blank">sign up for a free trial</a>.
