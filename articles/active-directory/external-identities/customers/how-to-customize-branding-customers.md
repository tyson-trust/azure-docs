# Customize the neutral branding in your customer tenant (preview)

After creating a new customer tenant, you can customize the end-user experience. Create a custom look and feel for users signing in to your web-based apps by configuring **Company branding** settings for your tenant. With these settings, you can add your own background images, colors, company logos, and text to customize the sign-in experiences across your apps.  
You can also create user flows programmatically using the Company Branding Graph API.

## Prerequisites

- If you haven't already created your own Azure AD customer tenant, create one now.
- [Register an application](how-to-register-ciam-app.md).  
- [Create a user flow](how-to-user-flow-sign-up-sign-in-customers.md)
- Review the file size requirements for each image you want to add. You may need to use a photo editor to create the right-sized images. The preferred image type for all images is PNG, but JPG is accepted.

## Comparing the default sign-in experiences between the customer tenant and the Azure AD tenant

The default sign-in experience is the global look and feel that applies across all sign-ins to your tenant. The default branding experiences between the customer tenant and the default Azure AD tenant are distinct.

Your Azure AD tenant supports Microsoft look and feel as a default state for authentication experience. You can [customize the default Microsoft sign-in experience](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding) with a custom background image or color, favicon, layout, header, and footer. You can also upload a [custom CSS](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/reference-company-branding-css-template). If the custom company branding fails to load for any reason, the sign-in page will revert to the default Microsoft branding.

Microsoft provides a neutral branding as the default for the customer tenant, which can be customized to meet the specific needs of your company. The default branding for the customer tenant is neutral and doesn't include any existing Microsoft branding. If the custom company branding fails to load for any reason, the sign-in page will revert to this neutral branding. It's also possible to add each custom branding property to the custom sign-in page individually.

The following list and image outline the elements of the default Microsoft sign-in experience in an Azure AD tenant: 

1. Microsoft background image and color.
2. Microsoft favicon.
3. Microsoft banner logo.
4. Footer as a page layout element.
5. Microsoft footer hyperlinks, for example,  Privacy & cookies, Terms of use and troubleshooting details also known as ellipsis in the right bottom corner of the screen.
6. Microsoft overlay.

## How to customize the default sign-in experience

Before you customize any settings, the neutral default branding will appear in your sign-in and sign-up pages.

### To customize user attributes

For your customer tenant, you might have different requirements for the information you want to collect during sign-up and sign-in. The customer tenant comes with a built-in set of information stored in attributes, such as Given Name, Surname, City, and Postal Code. You can create custom attributes in your customer tenant using the  Microsoft Graph API or in the portal under the **Text** tab in **Company Branding**. 

1. On the **Text** tab select **Add Custom Text**.
1. Select any of the options:

      - Select **Attributes** to override the default values. 
      - Select **Attribute collection** to add a new attribute option that you would like to collect during the sign-up process.
      - Select **Sign in** to add custom text for the sign-in page.
      - Select **Sign up** to add custom text for the sign-in page.
      - Select **Sign-in/up one time code (SISU OTC)** to add a custom title.

1. Select **Add** once you finished with your changes. You can edit the existing custom text by selecting the **Text name** and select Save. 

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> In the customer tenant, we have two options to add custom text to the sign-up and sign-in experience.  The function is available under each user flow during language customization and also under Company branding. Although we have two ways to customize strings (via Company Branding and via User Flows), both ways modify the same JSON file. The most recent change made either via User flows or via Company branding  will always override the previous one.

Your customer tenant name replaces the Microsoft banner logo in the neutral default sign-in experience. You can customize your tenant's name in the Properties area.
