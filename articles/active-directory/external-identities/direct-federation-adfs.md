# Example: Configure SAML/WS-Fed based identity provider federation with AD FS

>[!NOTE]
>- *Direct federation* in Azure Active Directory is now referred to as *SAML/WS-Fed identity provider (IdP) federation*.

This article describes how to set up [SAML/WS-Fed IdP federation](direct-federation.md) using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as either a SAML 2.0 or WS-Fed IdP. To support federation, certain attributes and claims must be configured at the IdP. To illustrate how to configure an IdP for federation, we’ll use Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as an example. We’ll show how to set up AD FS both as a SAML IdP and as a WS-Fed IdP.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to set up AD FS for both SAML and WS-Fed for illustration purposes. For federation integrations where the IdP is AD FS, we recommend using WS-Fed as the protocol.

## Configure AD FS for SAML 2.0 federation

Azure AD B2B can be configured to federate with IdPs that use the SAML protocol with specific requirements listed below. To illustrate the SAML configuration steps, this section shows how to set up AD FS for SAML 2.0.

To set up federation, the following attributes must be received in the SAML 2.0 response from the IdP. These attributes can be configured by linking to the online security token service XML file or by entering them manually. Step 12 in [Create a test AD FS instance](https://medium.com/in-the-weeds/create-a-test-active-directory-federation-services-3-0-instance-on-an-azure-virtual-machine-9071d978e8ed) describes how to find the AD FS endpoints or how to generate your metadata URL, for example `https://fs.iga.azure-test.net/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`.

|Attribute  |Value  |
|---------|---------|
|AssertionConsumerService     |`https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf`         |
|Audience     |`urn:federation:MicrosoftOnline`         |
|Issuer     |The issuer URI of the partner IdP, for example `http://www.example.com/exk10l6w90DHM0yi...`         |

The following claims need to be configured in the SAML 2.0 token issued by the IdP:


|Attribute  |Value  |
|---------|---------|
|NameID Format     |`urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`         |
|emailaddress     |`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`         |


The next section illustrates how to configure the required attributes and claims using AD FS as an example of a SAML 2.0 IdP.

### Before you begin

An AD FS server must already be set up and functioning before you begin this procedure. 

### Add the claim description

1. On your AD FS server, select **Tools** > **AD FS management**.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Service** > **Claim Descriptions**.
1. Under **Actions**, select **Add Claim Description**.
1. In the **Add a Claim Description** window, specify the following values:

   - **Display Name**: Persistent Identifier
   - **Claim identifier**: `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`
   - Select the check box for **Publish this claim description in federation metadata as a claim type that this federation service can accept**.
   - Select the check box for **Publish this claim description in federation metadata as a claim type that this federation service can send**.

1. Click **Ok**.

### Add the relying party trust

1. On the AD FS server, go to **Tools** > **AD FS Management**.
2. In the navigation pane, select **Relying Party Trusts**.

6. Leave the other settings in their default options. Continue to select **Next**, and finally select **Close** to close the wizard.
7. In **AD FS Management**, under **Relying Party Trusts**, right click the relying party trust you just created and select **Properties**.
8. In the **Monitoring** tab, uncheck the box **Monitor relying party**.
9. In the **Identifiers** tab, enter ``https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant ID>/`` in the **Relying party identifier** text box using the tenant ID of the service partner’s Azure AD tenant. Select **Add**.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to include a slash (/) after the tenant ID, for example: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/00000000-27d4-489f-a23b-00000000084d/`.

10. Select **OK**.

### Create claims rules

1. Right-click the relying party trust you created, and then select **Edit Claim Issuance Policy**.
1. In the **Edit Claim Rules** wizard, select **Add Rule**. 
1. In **Claim rule template**, select **Send LDAP Attributes as Claims**. 
1. In **Configure Claim Rule**, specify the following values: 

   - **Claim rule name**: Email claim rule 
   - **Attribute store**: Active Directory 
   - **LDAP Attribute**: E-Mail-Addresses 
   - **Outgoing Claim Type**: E-Mail Address

1. Select **Finish**.
1. Select **Add Rule**.
1. In **Claim rule template**, select **Transform an Incoming Claim**, and then select **Next**. 
1. In **Configure Claim Rule**, specify the following values: 

   - **Claim rule name**: Email transform rule 
   - **Incoming claim type**: E-mail Address 
   - **Outgoing claim type**: Name ID 
   - **Outgoing name ID format**: Persistent Identifier 
   - Select **Pass through all claim values**.

1. Select **Finish**. 
1. The **Edit Claim Rules** pane shows the new rules. Select **Apply**. 
1. Select **OK**. The AD FS server is now configured for federation using the SAML 2.0 protocol.

## Configure AD FS for WS-Fed federation

Azure AD B2B can be configured to federate with IdPs that use the WS-Fed protocol with the specific requirements listed below. Currently, the two WS-Fed providers have been tested for compatibility with Azure AD include AD FS and Shibboleth. Here, we’ll use Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) as an example of the WS-Fed IdP. For more information about establishing a relying party trust between a WS-Fed compliant provider with Azure AD, download the Azure AD Identity Provider Compatibility Docs.

To set up federation, the following attributes must be received in the WS-Fed message from the IdP. These attributes can be configured by linking to the online security token service XML file or by entering them manually. Step 12 in [Create a test AD FS instance](https://medium.com/in-the-weeds/create-a-test-active-directory-federation-services-3-0-instance-on-an-azure-virtual-machine-9071d978e8ed) describes how to find the AD FS endpoints or how to generate your metadata URL, for example `https://fs.iga.azure-test.net/federationmetadata/2007-06/federationmetadata.xml`.
 
|Attribute  |Value  |
|---------|---------|
|PassiveRequestorEndpoint     |`https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf`         |
|Audience     |`urn:federation:MicrosoftOnline`         |
|Issuer     |The issuer URI of the partner IdP, for example `http://www.example.com/exk10l6w90DHM0yi...`         |

Required claims for the WS-Fed token issued by the IdP:

|Attribute  |Value  |
|---------|---------|
|ImmutableID     |`http://schemas.microsoft.com/LiveID/Federation/2008/05/ImmutableID`         |
|emailaddress     |`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`         |

The next section illustrates how to configure the required attributes and claims using AD FS as an example of a WS-Fed IdP.
