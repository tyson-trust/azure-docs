# Create dynamic groups in Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration

## What are dynamic groups?
A dynamic group is a dynamic configuration of security group membership for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) available in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Administrators can set rules to populate groups that are created in Azure AD based on user attributes (such as [userType](user-properties.md), department, or country/region). Members can be automatically added to or removed from a security group based on their attributes. These groups can provide access to applications or cloud resources (SharePoint sites, documents) and to assign licenses to members. Learn more about [dedicated groups in Azure Active Directory](../fundamentals/how-to-manage-groups.md).

## Prerequisites
[Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access-management/azure-ad-pricing) is required to create and use dynamic groups. Learn more in [Create attribute-based rules for dynamic group membership in Azure Active Directory](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership.md).

## Creating an "all users" dynamic group

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

You can create a group containing all users within a tenant using a membership rule. When users are added or removed from the tenant in the future, the group's membership is adjusted automatically.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Global administrator or User administrator role in the tenant.
1. Select **Azure Active Directory**.
2. Under **Manage**, select **Groups**, and then select **New group**.
1. On the **New Group** page, under **Group type**, select **Security**. Enter a **Group name** and **Group description** for the new group. 
2. Under **Membership type**, select **Dynamic User**, and then select **Add dynamic query**. 
4. Above the **Rule syntax** text box, select **Edit**. On the **Edit rule syntax** page, type the following expression in the text box:

   ```
   user.objectId -ne null
   ```
1. Select **OK**. The rule appears in the Rule syntax box:

   :::image type="content" source="media/use-dynamic-groups/all-user-rule-syntax.png" alt-text="Screenshot of rule syntax for all users dynamic group." lightbox="media/use-dynamic-groups/all-user-rule-syntax.png":::

1.  Select **Save**. The new dynamic group will now include B2B guest users and member users.


1. Select **Create** on the **New group** page to create the group.

## Creating a group of members only

If you want your group to exclude guest users and include only members of your tenant, create a dynamic group as described above, but in the **Rule syntax** box, enter the following expression:

```
(user.objectId -ne null) and (user.userType -eq "Member")
```

The following image shows the rule syntax for a dynamic group modified to include members only and exclude guests.

## Creating a group of guests only

You might also find it useful to create a new dynamic group that contains only guest users, so that you can apply policies (such as Azure AD Conditional Access policies) to them. Create a dynamic group as described above, but in the **Rule syntax** box, enter the following expression:

```
(user.objectId -ne null) and (user.userType -eq "Guest")
```

The following image shows the rule syntax for a dynamic group modified to include guests only and exclude member users.
