# Auditing and reporting a B2B collaboration user
With guest users, you have auditing capabilities similar to with member users.

## Access reviews
You can use access reviews to periodically verify whether guest users still need access to your resources. The **Access reviews** feature is available in **Azure Active Directory** under **External Identities** > **Access reviews**. You can also search for "access reviews" from **All services** in the Azure portal. To learn how to use access reviews, see [Manage guest access with Azure AD access reviews](../governance/manage-guest-access-with-access-reviews.md).

## Audit logs

The Azure AD audit logs provide records of system and user activities, including activities initiated by guest users. To access audit logs, in **Azure Active Directory**, under **Monitoring**, select **Audit logs**. To access audit logs of one specific user, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > select the user > **Audit logs**.

You can dive into each of these events to get the details. For example, let's look at the user update details.

You can also export these logs from Azure AD and use the reporting tool of your choice to get customized reports.

## Sponsors field for B2B users (preview) 

You can also manage and track your guest users in the organization using the sponsors feature (preview). The **Sponsors** field on the user account displays who is responsible for the guest user. A sponsor can be a user or a group. To learn more about the sponsors feature (preview), see [Add sponsors to a guest user](b2b-sponsors.md).
