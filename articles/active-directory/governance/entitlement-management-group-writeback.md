# Setting up group writeback within entitlement management

This article shows you how to set up group writeback in entitlement management. Group writeback is a feature that allows you to write cloud groups back to your on-premises Active Directory instance by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect sync.

## Set up group writeback in entitlement management


To set up group writeback for Microsoft 365 groups in access packages, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- Set up group writeback in the Azure Active Directory admin center. 
- The Organizational Unit (OU) that is used to set up group writeback in Azure AD Connect Configuration.
- Complete the [group writeback enablement steps](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-group-writeback-enable.md) for Azure AD Connect. 
 
Using group writeback, you can now sync Microsoft 365 groups that are part of access packages to on-premises Active Directory. To sync the groups, follow the steps: 

1. Create an Azure Active Directory Microsoft 365 group.

1. Set the group to be written back to on-premises Active Directory. For instructions, see [Group writeback in the Azure Active Directory admin center](../enterprise-users/groups-write-back-portal.md). 

1. Add the group to an access package as a resource role. See [Create a new access package](entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#select-resource-roles) for guidance. 

1. Assign the user to the access package. See [View, add, and remove assignments for an access package](entitlement-management-access-package-assignments.md#directly-assign-a-user) for instructions to directly assign a user. 

1. After you've assigned a user to the access package, confirm that the user is now a member of the on-premises group once Azure AD Connect Sync cycle completes:
    1. View the member property of the group in the on-premises OU OR 
    1. Review the member Of on the user object. 

> [!NOTE]   
> Azure AD Connect's default sync cycle schedule is every 30 minutes. You may need to wait until the next cycle occurs to see results on-premises or choose to run the sync cycle manually to see results sooner.
