# Manage workflow versions

Workflows created with Lifecycle Workflows are able to grow and change with the needs of your organization. Workflows exist as versions from creation. When making changes to other than basic information, you create a new version of the workflow. For more information, see  [Manage a workflow's properties](manage-workflow-properties.md).

Changing a workflow's tasks or execution conditions requires the creation of a new version of that workflow. Tasks within workflows can be added, reordered, and removed at will. Updating a workflow's tasks or execution conditions within the Azure portal will trigger the creation of a new version of the workflow automatically. Making these updates in Microsoft Graph will require the new workflow version to be created manually.


## Edit the tasks of a workflow using the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]


Tasks within workflows can be added, edited, reordered, and removed at will. To edit the tasks of a workflow using the Azure portal, you complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Type in **Identity Governance** on the search bar near the top of the page and select it.

1. In the left menu, select **Lifecycle workflows**. 

1. In the left menu, select **workflows**.
    
1. On the left side of the screen, select **Tasks**.

1. You can add a task to the workflow by selecting the **Add task** button.

1. You can enable and disable tasks as needed by using the **Enable** and **Disable** buttons.

1. You can reorder the order in which tasks are executed in the workflow by selecting the **Reorder** button. You can also remove a task from a workflow by using the **Remove** button.

1. After making changes, select **save** to capture changes to the tasks.


## Edit the execution conditions of a workflow using the Azure portal

To edit the execution conditions of a workflow using the Azure portal, you do the following steps:


1. On the left menu of Lifecycle Workflows, select **Workflows**.

1. On the left side of the screen, select **Execution conditions**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-workflow-tasks/execution-conditions-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the execution condition details of a workflow." lightbox="media/manage-workflow-tasks/execution-conditions-details.png":::

1. On this screen, you're presented with **Trigger details**. Here we have a trigger type and attribute details. In the template you can edit the attribute details to define when a workflow is run in relation to the attribute value measured in days. This attribute value can be from 0 to 60 days.
    

1. Select the **Scope** tab.
    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-workflow-tasks/execution-conditions-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the execution scope page of a workflow." lightbox="media/manage-workflow-tasks/execution-conditions-scope.png":::

1. On this screen you can define rules for who the workflow runs. In the template **Scope type** is set as Rule-Based, and you define the rule using expressions on user properties. For more information on supported user properties. see: [supported queries on user properties](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#user-properties).

1. After making changes, select **save** to capture changes to the execution conditions.


## See versions of a workflow using the Azure portal

1. On the left menu of Lifecycle Workflows, select **Workflows**.

1. On this page, you see a list of all of your current workflows. Select the workflow that you want to see versions of.
 
1. On the left side of the screen, select **Versions**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/manage-workflow-tasks/manage-versions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of versions of a workflow." lightbox="media/manage-workflow-tasks/manage-versions.png":::

1. On this page, you see a list of the workflow versions.
