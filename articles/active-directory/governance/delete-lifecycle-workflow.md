# Delete a lifecycle workflow

You can remove workflows that you no longer need. Deleting these workflows helps keep your lifecycle strategy up to date.

When a workflow is deleted, it enters a soft-delete state. During this period, you can still view it in the list of deleted workflows and restore it if needed. A workflow is permanently removed 30 days after it  enters a soft-delete state. If you don't want to wait 30 days for a workflow to be permanently deleted, you can manually delete it.
