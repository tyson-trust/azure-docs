# What is a device identity?

A [device identity](/graph/api/resources/device) is an object in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This device object is similar to users, groups, or applications. A device identity gives administrators information they can use when making access or configuration decisions.

There are three ways to get a device identity:

- Azure AD registration
- Azure AD join
- Hybrid Azure AD join

Device identities are a prerequisite for scenarios like [device-based Conditional Access policies](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-grant.md) and [Mobile Device Management with the Microsoft Intune family of products](/mem/endpoint-manager-overview).

## Modern device scenario

The modern device scenario focuses on two of these methods: 

- [Azure AD registration](concept-device-registration.md) 
   - Bring your own device (BYOD)
   - Mobile device (cell phone and tablet)
- [Azure AD join](concept-directory-join.md)
   - Windows 11 and Windows 10 devices owned by your organization
   - [Windows Server 2019 and newer servers in your organization running as VMs in Azure](howto-vm-sign-in-azure-ad-windows.md)

[Hybrid Azure AD join](concept-hybrid-join.md) is seen as an interim step on the road to Azure AD join. Hybrid Azure AD join provides organizations support for downlevel Windows versions back to Windows 7 and Server 2008. All three scenarios can coexist in a single organization.

## Resource access

Registering and joining devices to Azure AD gives users Seamless Sign-on (SSO) to cloud-based resources.

Devices that are Azure AD joined benefit from [SSO to your organization's on-premises resources](device-sso-to-on-premises-resources.md).

## Provisioning

Getting devices in to Azure AD can be done in a self-service manner or a controlled process managed by administrators.
