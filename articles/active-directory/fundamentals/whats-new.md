### Public Preview(Refresh) - Custom Extensions in Entitlement Management

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Entitlement management                          
**Product capability:** Identity Governance                

Last year we announced the [public preview of custom extensions in Entitlement Management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/run-custom-workflows-in-azure-ad-entitlement-management/ba-p/2466938) allowing you to automate complex processes when access is requested or about to expire. We have recently expanded the public preview to allow for the access package assignment request to be paused while your external process is running. In addition, the external process can now provide feedback to Entitlement Management to either surface additional information to end users in MyAccess or even stop the access request. This expands the scenarios of custom extension from notifications to additional stakeholders or the generation of tickets to advanced scenarios such as external governance, risk and compliance checks. In the course of this update, we have also improved the audit logs, token security and the payload sent to the Logic App. To learn more about the preview refresh, see:

-  [Trigger Logic Apps with custom extensions in entitlement management (Preview)](../governance/entitlement-management-logic-apps-integration.md)

### General Availability - Managed Identity in Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                            
**Product capability:** User Authentication               

The latest version of MSAL.NET graduates the Managed Identity APIs into the General Availability mode of support, which means that developers can integrate them safely in production workloads.

Managed identities are a part of the Azure infrastructure, simplifying how developers handle credentials and secrets to access cloud resources. With Managed Identities, developers don't need to manually handle credential retrieval and security. Instead, they can rely on an automatically managed set of identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory authentication. You can learn more in [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](../managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md)

With MSAL.NET 4.54.0, the Managed Identity APIs are now stable. There are a few changes that we added that make them easier to use and integrate that might require tweaking your code if you’ve used our [experimental implementation](https://den.dev/blog/managed-identity-msal-net/):

- When using Managed Identity APIs, developers need to specify the identity type when creating an [ManagedIdentityApplication](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.managedidentityapplication).
- When acquiring tokens with Managed Identity APIs and using the default HTTP client, MSAL retries the request for certain exception codes.
- We added a new [MsalManagedIdentityException](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.msalmanagedidentityexception) class that represents any Managed Identity-related exceptions. It includes general exception information, including the Azure source from which the exception originates.
- MSAL will now proactively refresh tokens acquired with Managed Identity.

To get started with Managed Identity in MSAL.NET, you can use the [Microsoft.Identity.Client](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client) package together with the [ManagedIdentityApplicationBuilder](/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.managedidentityapplicationbuilder) class.

### General Availability - System preferred MFA method

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)                       
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection            

Currently, organizations and users rely on a range of authentication methods, each offering varying degrees of security. While Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is crucial, some MFA methods are more secure than others. Despite having access to more secure MFA options, users frequently choose less secure methods for various reasons.

To address this challenge, we're introducing a new system-preferred authentication method for MFA. When users sign in, the system will determine and display the most secure MFA method that the user has registered. This prompts users to switch from the default method to the most secure option. While users may still choose a different MFA method, they'll always be prompted to use the most secure method first for every session that requires MFA. For more information, see: [System-preferred multifactor authentication - Authentication methods policy](../authentication/concept-system-preferred-multifactor-authentication.md).

### General Availability- New limits on number and size of group secrets starting June 2023

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Group Management                   
**Product capability:** Directory            

Starting in June 2023, the secrets stored on a single group can't exceed 48 individual secrets, or have a total size greater than 10 KB across all secrets on a single group. Groups with more than 10 KB of secrets will immediately stop working in June 2023. In June, groups exceeding 48 secrets are unable to increase the number of secrets they have, though they may still update or delete those secrets. We highly recommend reducing to fewer than 48 secrets by January 2024.

Group secrets are typically created when a group is assigned credentials to an app using Password-based single sign-on. To reduce the number of secrets assigned to a group, we recommend creating additional groups, and splitting up group assignments to your Password-based SSO applications across those new groups. For more information, see: [Add password-based single sign-on to an application](../manage-apps/configure-password-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications.md).

**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation          

Due to a technical issue, we have recently started to emit additional audit logs for terms of use. The additional audit logs will be turned off by May 1 and are tagged with the core directory service and the agreement category. If you have built a dependency on the additional audit logs, you must switch to the regular audit logs tagged with the terms of use service.

### General Availability - Number Matching for Microsoft Authenticator notifications

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Microsoft Authenticator App                      
**Product capability:** User Authentication             

Microsoft Authenticator app’s number matching feature has been Generally Available since Nov 2022! If you haven't already used the rollout controls (via Azure portal Admin UX and MSGraph APIs) to smoothly deploy number matching for users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications, we highly encourage you to do so. We previously announced that we'll remove the admin controls and enforce the number match experience tenant-wide for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications starting February 27, 2023. After listening to customers, we'll extend the availability of the rollout controls for a few more weeks. Organizations can continue to use the existing rollout controls until May 8, 2023, to deploy number matching in their organizations. Microsoft services will start enforcing the number matching experience for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications after May 8, 2023. We'll also remove the rollout controls for number matching after that date.

If customers don’t enable number match for all Microsoft Authenticator push notifications prior to May 8, 2023, Authenticator users may experience inconsistent sign-ins while the services are rolling out this change. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.

For more information, see: [How to use number matching in multifactor authentication (MFA) notifications - Authentication methods policy](../authentication/how-to-mfa-number-match.md)

### Public Preview - IPv6 coming to Azure AD

**Type:** Plan for Change     
**Service category:** Identity Protection                     
**Product capability:** Platform             

Earlier, we announced our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), enabling our customers to reach the Azure AD services over IPv4, IPv6 or dual stack endpoints. This is just a reminder that we have started introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach in late March 2023.  
 
If you utilize Conditional Access or Identity Protection, and have IPv6 enabled on any of your devices, you likely must take action to avoid impacting your users. For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to deprioritize IPv4 in any Azure AD features or services. We continue to share additional guidance on IPv6 enablement in Azure AD at this link: [IPv6 support in Azure Active Directory](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/azure-ad-ipv6-support).

### Modernizing Terms of Use Experiences

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Terms of use                  
**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation        

Starting July 2023, we're modernizing the following Terms of Use end user experiences with an updated PDF viewer, and moving the experiences from https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com to https://myaccount.microsoft.com:
- View previously accepted terms of use.
- Accept or decline terms of use as part of the sign-in flow.

No functionalities are removed. The new PDF viewer adds functionality and the limited visual changes in the end-user experiences will be communicated in a future update. If your organization has allow-listed only certain domains, you must ensure your allowlist includes the domains ‘myaccount.microsoft.com’ and ‘*.myaccount.microsoft.com’ for Terms of Use to continue working as expected.

## February 2023

### General Availability - Expanding Privileged Identity Management Role Activation across the Azure portal

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management                    
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management           

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) role activation has been expanded to the Billing and AD extensions in the Azure portal. Shortcuts have been added to Subscriptions (billing) and Access Control (AD) to allow users to activate PIM roles directly from these settings. From the Subscriptions settings, select **View eligible subscriptions** in the horizontal command menu to check your eligible, active, and expired assignments. From there, you can activate an eligible assignment in the same pane. In Access control (IAM) for a resource, you can now select **View my access** to see your currently active and eligible role assignments and activate directly. By integrating PIM capabilities into different Azure portal blades, this new feature allows users to gain temporary access to view or edit subscriptions and resources more easily.


For more information Microsoft cloud settings, see: [Activate my Azure resource roles in Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-resource-roles-activate-your-roles.md).

### General Availability - Follow Azure AD best practices with recommendations

**Type:** New feature   
**Service category:** Reporting                  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting            

Azure AD recommendations help you improve your tenant posture by surfacing opportunities to implement best practices. On a daily basis, Azure AD analyzes the configuration of your tenant. During this analysis, Azure AD compares the data of a recommendation with the actual configuration of your tenant. If a recommendation is flagged as applicable to your tenant, the recommendation appears in the Recommendations section of the Azure AD Overview. 

This release includes our first 3 recommendations:

- Convert from per-user MFA to Conditional Access MFA
- Migration applications from AD FS to Azure AD
- Minimize MFA prompts from known devices


For more information, see: 

- [What are Azure Active Directory recommendations?](../reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations.md)
- [Use the Azure AD recommendations API to implement Azure AD best practices for your tenant](/graph/api/resources/recommendations-api-overview)

**Type:** Changed feature   
**Service category:** Identity Protection                    
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection           

Unfamiliar sign-in properties risk detection now provides risk reasons as to which properties are unfamiliar for customers to better investigate that risk. 

Identity Protection now surfaces the unfamiliar properties in the Azure portal on UX and in API as *Additional Info* with a user-friendly description explaining that *the following properties are unfamiliar for this sign-in of the given user*. 

There's no additional work to enable this feature, the unfamiliar properties are shown by default. For more information, see: [Sign-in risk](../identity-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks.md).
