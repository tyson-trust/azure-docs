# About Microsoft Support access requests (preview)

Microsoft Support requests are automatically assigned to a support engineer with expertise in solving similar problems. To expedite solution delivery, our support engineers use diagnostic tooling to read [identity diagnostic data](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/support-data-collection-diagnostic-logs) for your tenant.

Microsoft Support's access to your identity diagnostic data is granted only with your approval, is read-only, and lasts only as long as we are actively working with you to solve your problem.

For many support requests created in the Microsoft Entra admin center, you can manage the access to your identity diagnostic data by enabling the "Allow collection of advanced diagnostic information" property. If this setting is set to "no" our support engineers must ask *you* to collect the data needed to solve your problem, which could slow down your problem resolution. 

## Microsoft Support access requests

Sometimes support engineers need additional approval from you to access identity diagnostic data to solve your problem. For example, if a support engineer needs to access identity diagnostic data in a different Microsoft Entra tenant than the one in which you created the support request, the engineer must ask you to grant them access to that data.

Microsoft Support access requests (preview) enable you to manage Microsoft Support's access to your identity diagnostic data for support requests where you cannot manage that access in the Microsoft Entra admin center's support request management experience.

## Support access role permissions

To manage Microsoft Support access requests, you must be assigned to a role that has full permission to manage Microsoft Entra support tickets for the tenant. This role permission is included in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) built-in roles with the action `microsoft.azure.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks`. You can see which Azure AD roles have this permission in the [Azure AD built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md) article.

Azure Active Directory is being renamed to Microsoft Entra ID. For more information see [New name for Azure Active Directory](../fundamentals/new-name.md).
