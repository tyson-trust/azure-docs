### General Availability - Prevent accidental deletions



**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Outbound to SaaS Applications 



Accidental deletion of users in any system could be disastrous. We’re excited to announce the general availability of the accidental deletions prevention capability as part of the Azure AD provisioning service. When the number of deletions to be processed in a single provisioning cycle spikes above a customer defined threshold, the Azure AD provisioning service pauses, provide you with visibility into the potential deletions, and allow you to accept or reject the deletions. This functionality has historically been available for Azure AD Connect, and Azure AD Connect Cloud Sync. It's now available across the various provisioning flows, including both HR-driven provisioning and application provisioning.

For more information, see: [Enable accidental deletions prevention in the Azure AD provisioning service](../app-provisioning/accidental-deletions.md)

### General Availability - Create group in administrative unit

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC       
**Product capability:** AuthZ/Access Delegation    
 

Groups Administrators and other roles scoped to an administrative unit can now create groups within the administrative unit.  Previously, creating a new group in administrative unit required a two-step process to first create the group, then add the group to the administrative unit.  The second step required a Privileged Role Administrator or Global Administrator.  Now, groups can be directly created in an administrative unit by anyone with appropriate roles scoped to the administrative unit, and this no longer requires a higher privilege admin role. For more information, see: [Add users, groups, or devices to an administrative unit](../roles/admin-units-members-add.md).

###  Public Preview – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  


We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true). 

We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).
