# Manage Microsoft Support access requests (preview)

You can use the Microsoft Entra admin center and the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal to manage Microsoft Support access requests (preview). Microsoft Support access requests enable you to [give Microsoft Support engineers access to identity diagnostic data](concept-support-access-requests.md) in your identity service to help solve support requests you submitted to Microsoft.

## Prerequisites

Only certain Azure AD roles are authorized to manage Microsoft Support access requests. To manage Microsoft Support access requests, a role must have the permission `microsoft.azure.supportTickets/allEntities/allTasks`. To see which Azure AD roles have this permission, search the [Azure AD built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md) for the required permission.

## View support access requests

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and navigate to **Diagnose and solve problems**.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select **Approved access** from the **Microsoft Support Access Requests** section.

1. Select the **Support request ID** link for the request you need to approve.

## Revoke access to an approved support access request

Closing a support request automatically revokes the support engineer's access to your identity diagnostic data. You can manually revoke Microsoft Support's access to identity diagnostic data for the support request *before* your support request is closed. 

Select the **Remove access** button to revoke access to an approved support access request.

When your support request is closed, the status of an approved Microsoft Support access request is automatically set to **Completed.** Microsoft Support access requests remain in the **Approved access** list for 30 days.
