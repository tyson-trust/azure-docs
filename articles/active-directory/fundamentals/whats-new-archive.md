### Microsoft Authentication Library End of Support Announcement

**Type:** N/A      
**Service category:** Other               
**Product capability:** Developer Experience         

As part of our ongoing initiative to improve the developer experience, service reliability, and security of customer applications, we end support for the Microsoft Authentication Library (Microsoft Authentication Library). The final deadline to migrate your applications to Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) has been extended to **June 30, 2023**. 

### Why are we doing this?

As we consolidate and evolve the Microsoft Identity platform, we're also investing in making significant improvements to the developer experience and service features that make it possible to build secure, robust and resilient applications. To make these features available to our customers, we needed to update the architecture of our software development kits. As a result of this change, we’ve decided that the path forward requires us to sunset Microsoft Authentication Library. This allows us to focus on developer experience investments with Microsoft Authentication Library. 

### What happens?

We recognize that changing libraries isn't an easy task, and can't be accomplished quickly. We're committed to helping customers plan their migrations to Microsoft Authentication Library and execute them with minimal disruption.

- In June 2020, we [announced the 2-year end of support timeline for Microsoft Authentication Library](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/end-of-support-timelines-for-azure-ad-authentication-library-adal-and-azure-ad-graph/). 
- In December 2022, we’ve decided to extend the Microsoft Authentication Library end of support to June 2023. 
- Through the next six months (January 2023 – June 2023) we continue informing customers about the upcoming end of support along with providing guidance on migration. 
- On June 2023 we'll officially sunset Microsoft Authentication Library, removing library documentation and archiving all GitHub repositories related to the project. 

### How to find out which applications in my tenant are using Microsoft Authentication Library?

Refer to our post on [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/questions/360928/information-how-to-find-apps-using-adal-in-your-te.html) for details on identifying Microsoft Authentication Library apps with the help of [Azure Workbooks](../../azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview.md). 
### If I’m using Microsoft Authentication Library, what can I expect after the deadline? 

- There will be no new releases (security or otherwise) to the library after June 2023. 
- We won't accept any incident reports or support requests for Microsoft Authentication Library. Microsoft Authentication Library to Microsoft Authentication Library migration support would continue.   
- The underpinning services continue working and applications that depend on Microsoft Authentication Library should continue working. Applications, and the resources they access, are at increased security and reliability risk due to not having the latest updates, service configuration, and enhancements made available through the Microsoft Identity platform. 

### What features can I only access with Microsoft Authentication Library?

The number of features and capabilities that we're adding to Microsoft Authentication Library libraries are growing weekly. Some of them include: 
- Support for Microsoft accounts (MSA) 
- Support for Azure AD B2C accounts 
- Handling throttling 
- Proactive token refresh and token revocation based on policy or critical events for Microsoft Graph and other APIs that support [Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)](../develop/app-resilience-continuous-access-evaluation.md)
- Auth broker support with device-based Conditional Access policies 
- Azure AD hardware-based certificate authentication (CBA) on mobile  
- System browsers on mobile devices 
And more. For an up-to-date list, refer to our [migration guide](../develop/msal-migration.md#how-to-migrate-to-msal). 

### How to migrate? 

To make the migration process easier, we published a [comprehensive guide](../develop/msal-migration.md#how-to-migrate-to-msal) that documents the migration paths across different platforms and programming languages. 

In addition to the Microsoft Authentication Library to Microsoft Authentication Library update, we recommend migrating from Azure AD Graph API to Microsoft Graph. This change enables you to take advantage of the latest additions and enhancements, such as CAE, across the Microsoft service offering through a single, unified endpoint. You can read more in our [Migrate your apps from Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph](/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-overview) guide. You can post any questions to [Microsoft Q&A](/answers/topics/azure-active-directory.html) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/msal).

### Public Preview - IPv6 coming to Azure AD



**Type:** Plan for change      
**Service category:** Identity Protection            
**Product capability:** Platform     

With the growing adoption and support of IPv6 across enterprise networks, service providers, and devices, many customers are wondering if their users can continue to access their services and applications from IPv6 clients and networks. Today, we’re excited to announce our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This allows customers to reach the Azure AD services over both IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols (dual stack).
For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to deprioritize IPv4 in any Azure Active Directory features or services.
We'll begin introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach, beginning March 31, 2023.
We have guidance that is specifically for Azure AD customers who use IPv6 addresses and also use Named Locations in their Conditional Access policies.

Customers who use named locations to identify specific network boundaries in their organization need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing named locations to anticipate potential risk.
1. Work with your network partner to identify egress IPv6 addresses in use in your environment.
1. Review and update existing named locations to include the identified IPv6 ranges.

Customers who use Conditional Access location based policies to restrict and secure access to their apps from specific networks need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing Conditional Access policies to identify use of named locations as a condition to anticipate potential risk.
1. Review and update existing Conditional Access location based policies to ensure they continue to meet your organization’s security requirements.

We continue to share additional guidance on IPv6 enablement in Azure AD at this link: https://aka.ms/azureadipv6.

###  General Availability – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 

We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true).

 
We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

###  Public Preview – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  


We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true). 

We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

### Public Preview - New APIs for fetching transitive role assignments and role permissions

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** RBAC role  
**Product capability:** Access Control
