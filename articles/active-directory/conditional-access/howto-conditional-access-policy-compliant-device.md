# Common Conditional Access policy: Require a compliant device, hybrid Azure AD joined device, or multifactor authentication for all users

Organizations who have deployed Microsoft Intune can use the information returned from their devices to identify devices that meet compliance requirements such as:

* Requiring a PIN to unlock
* Requiring device encryption
* Requiring a minimum or maximum operating system version
* Requiring a device isn't jailbroken or rooted

Policy compliance information is sent to Azure AD where Conditional Access decides to grant or block access to resources. More information about device compliance policies can be found in the article, [Set rules on devices to allow access to resources in your organization using Intune](/intune/protect/device-compliance-get-started)

Requiring a hybrid Azure AD joined device is dependent on your devices already being hybrid Azure AD joined. For more information, see the article [Configure hybrid Azure AD join](../devices/how-to-hybrid-join.md).

## Create a Conditional Access policy

The following steps will help create a Conditional Access policy to require multifactor authentication, devices accessing resources be marked as compliant with your organization's Intune compliance policies, or be hybrid Azure AD joined.

1. Sign in to the **[Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com)** as a [Conditional Access Administrator](../roles/permissions-reference.md#conditional-access-administrator).
1. Browse to **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **Create new policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All users**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
1. Under **Target resources** > **Cloud apps** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
   1. If you must exclude specific applications from your policy, you can choose them from the **Exclude** tab under **Select excluded cloud apps** and choose **Select**.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**.
   1. Select **Require multifactor authentication**, **Require device to be marked as compliant**, and **Require hybrid Azure AD joined device**
   1. **For multiple controls** select **Require one of the selected controls**.
   1. Select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After administrators confirm the settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), they can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can enroll your new devices to Intune even if you select **Require device to be marked as compliant** for **All users** and **All cloud apps** using the steps above. **Require device to be marked as compliant** control does not block Intune enrollment and the access to the Microsoft Intune Web Company Portal application. 

### Known behavior

On Windows 7, iOS, Android, macOS, and some third-party web browsers, Azure AD identifies the device using a client certificate that is provisioned when the device is registered with Azure AD. When a user first signs in through the browser the user is prompted to select the certificate. The end user must select this certificate before they can continue to use the browser.

#### Subscription activation

Organizations that use the [Subscription Activation](/windows/deployment/windows-10-subscription-activation) feature to enable users to “step-up” from one version of Windows to another, may want to exclude the Universal Store Service APIs and Web Application, AppID 45a330b1-b1ec-4cc1-9161-9f03992aa49f from their Conditional Access policy.
