# Continuous access evaluation for workload identities (preview)

Continuous access evaluation (CAE) for [workload identities](../workload-identities/workload-identities-overview.md) provides security benefits to your organization. It enables real-time enforcement of Conditional Access location and risk policies along with instant enforcement of token revocation events for workload identities. 

Continuous access evaluation doesn't currently support managed identities.

## Scope of preview

The continuous access evaluation for workload identities public preview scope includes support for Microsoft Graph as a resource provider.

The preview targets service principals for line of business (LOB) applications.

We support the following revocation events:

- Service principal disable
- Service principal delete
- High service principal risk as detected by Azure AD Identity Protection

Continuous access evaluation for workload identities supports [Conditional Access policies that target location and risk](workload-identity.md#implementation).

## Enable your application

Developers can opt in to Continuous access evaluation for workload identities when their API requests `xms_cc` as an optional claim. The `xms_cc` claim with a value of `cp1` in the access token is the authoritative way to identify a client application is capable of handling a claims challenge. For more information about how to make this work in your application, see the article, [Claims challenges, claims requests, and client capabilities](../develop/claims-challenge.md).

### Disable 

In order to opt out, don't send the `xms_cc` claim with a value of `cp1`. 

Organizations who have Azure AD Premium can create a [Conditional Access policy to disable continuous access evaluation](concept-conditional-access-session.md#customize-continuous-access-evaluation) applied to specific workload identities as an immediate stop-gap measure.

## Troubleshooting

When a client’s access to a resource is blocked due to CAE being triggered, the client’s session will be revoked, and the client will need to reauthenticate. This behavior can be verified in the sign-in logs. 

The following steps detail how an admin can verify sign in activity in the sign-in logs: 

1. Sign into the Azure portal as a Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Sign-in logs** > **Service Principal Sign-ins**. You can use filters to ease the debugging process. 
1. Select an entry to see activity details. The **Continuous access evaluation** field indicates whether a CAE token was issued in a particular sign-in attempt.
