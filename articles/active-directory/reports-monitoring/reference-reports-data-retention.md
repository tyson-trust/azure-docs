# Azure Active Directory data retention

In this article, you learn about the data retention policies for the different activity reports in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 

## When does Azure AD start collecting data?

| Azure AD Edition | Collection Start |
| :--              | :--   |
| Azure AD Premium P1 <br /> Azure AD Premium P2 <br /> Entra Workload Identities Premium | When you sign up for a subscription |
| Azure AD Free| The first time you open [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) or use the [reporting APIs](./overview-reports.md)  |

If you already have activities data with your free license, then you can see it immediately on upgrade. If you donâ€™t have any data, then it will take up to three days for the data to show up in the reports after you upgrade to a premium license. For security signals, the collection process starts when you opt-in to use the **Identity Protection Center**. 

## How long does Azure AD store the data?

**Activity reports**	

| Report                 | Azure AD Free | Azure AD Premium P1 | Azure AD Premium P2 |
| :--                    | :--           | :--                 | :--                 |
| Audit logs             | Seven days        | 30 days             | 30 days             |
| Sign-ins               | Seven days        | 30 days             | 30 days             |
| Azure AD MFA usage        | 30 days       | 30 days             | 30 days             |

You can retain the audit and sign-in activity data for longer than the default retention period outlined in the previous table by routing it to an Azure storage account using Azure Monitor. For more information, see [Archive Azure AD logs to an Azure storage account](quickstart-azure-monitor-route-logs-to-storage-account.md).

**Security signals**

| Report         | Azure AD Free | Azure AD Premium P1 | Azure AD Premium P2 |
| :--            | :--           | :--                 | :--                 |
| Risky users    | No limit      | No limit            | No limit            |
| Risky sign-ins | 7 days        | 30 days             | 90 days             |

> [!NOTE]
> Risky users and workload identities are not deleted until the risk has been remediated.
## Can I see last month's data after getting a premium license?

**No**, you can't. Azure stores up to seven days of activity data for a free version. When you switch from a free to a premium version, you can only see up to 7 days of data.
