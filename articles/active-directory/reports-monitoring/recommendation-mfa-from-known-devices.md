# Azure AD recommendation: Minimize MFA prompts from known devices 

[Azure AD recommendations](overview-recommendations.md) is a feature that provides you with personalized insights and actionable guidance to align your tenant with recommended best practices.

This article covers the recommendation to minimize multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts from known devices. This recommendation is called `tenantMFA` in the recommendations API in Microsoft Graph. 

## Description

As an admin, you want to maintain security for your companyâ€™s resources, but you also want your employees to easily access resources as needed.

MFA enables you to enhance the security posture of your tenant. While enabling MFA is a good practice, you should try to keep the number of MFA prompts your users have to go through at a minimum. One option you have to accomplish this goal is to **allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on trusted devices**.

The "remember multi-factor authentication on trusted device" feature sets a persistent cookie on the browser when a user selects the "Don't ask again for X days" option at sign-in. The user isn't prompted again for MFA from that browser until the cookie expires. If the user opens a different browser on the same device or clears the cookies, they're prompted again to verify.

For more information, see [Configure Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication settings](../authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md).

This recommendation shows up if you have set the **remember multi-factor authentication** feature to less than 30 days.

## Value 

This recommendation improves your user's productivity and minimizes the sign-in time with fewer MFA prompts. Ensure that your most sensitive resources can have the tightest controls, while your least sensitive resources can be more freely accessible.

## Action plan

1. Review the [How to configure Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication settings](../authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings.md) article.  
1. Go to **Azure AD** > **Multifactor authentication** > select the **Additional cloud-based multifactor authentication settings** link.
