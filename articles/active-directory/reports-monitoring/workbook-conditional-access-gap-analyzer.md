![Workbook category](./media/workbook-conditional-access-gap-analyzer/workbook-category.png)

As an IT administrator, you want to make sure that only the right people can access your resources. Azure AD Conditional Access helps you to accomplish this goal.  

The Conditional Access gap analyzer workbook helps you to verify that your Conditional Access policies work as expected.

**This workbook:**

- Highlights user sign-ins that have no Conditional Access policies applied to them. 
- Allows you to ensure that there are no users, applications, or locations that have been unintentionally excluded from Conditional Access policies.  

 

## Sections


The workbook has four sections:  

- Users signing in using legacy authentication 

- Number of sign-ins by applications that aren't impacted by Conditional Access policies 

- High risk sign-in events bypassing Conditional Access policies 

- Number of sign-ins by location that weren't affected by Conditional Access policies

Each of these trends offers a breakdown of sign-ins to the user level, so that you can see which users per scenario are bypassing Conditional Access.
