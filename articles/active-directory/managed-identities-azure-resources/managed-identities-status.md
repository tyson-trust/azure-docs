# Azure services that can use managed identities to access other services

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. Using a managed identity, you can authenticate to any [service that supports Azure AD authentication](./services-id-authentication-support.md) without managing credentials. We are integrating managed identities for Azure resources and Azure AD authentication across Azure. This page provides links to services' content that can use managed identities to access other Azure resources. Each entry in the table includes a link to service documentation discussing managed identities.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> New technical content is added daily. This list does not include every article that talks about managed identities. Please refer to each service's content set for details on their managed identities support. Resource provider namespace information is available in the article titled [Resource providers for Azure services](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers.md).

## Services supporting managed identities

The following Azure services support managed identities for Azure resources:
