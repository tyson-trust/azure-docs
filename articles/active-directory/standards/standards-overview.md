# Configure Azure Active Directory to meet identity standards

In today's world of interconnected infrastructures, compliance with governmental and industry frameworks and standards is often mandatory. Microsoft engages with governments, regulators, and standards bodies to understand and meet compliance requirements for Azure. There are [90 Azure compliance certifications](../../compliance/index.yml), which include many for various countries/regions. Azure has 35 compliance offerings for key industries including, 

* Health
* Government
* Finance
* Education
* Manufacturing
* Media

## Azure compliance is a head start

Compliance is a shared responsibility for Microsoft, cloud service providers (CSPs), and organizations. Use Azure compliance certifications as a basis for your compliance, and then configure Azure Active Directory to meet identity standards.

CSPs, government agencies, and those who work with them, must meet one or more sets of government standards, which can include:

* [US Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fedramp)
* [National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST)](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-nist-800-53)

CSPs and organizations in industries such as healthcare and finance have standards, such as: 

* [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA)](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-hipaa-us)
* [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX)](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-sox-us)

To learn more about supported compliance frameworks, see [Azure compliance offerings](/azure/compliance/offerings/).
