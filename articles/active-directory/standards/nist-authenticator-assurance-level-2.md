# NIST authenticator assurance level 2 with Azure Active Directory

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develops technical requirements for US federal agencies implementing identity solutions. Organizations working with federal agencies must meet these requirements.

Before starting authenticator assurance level 2 (AAL2), you can see the following resources:

* [NIST overview](nist-overview.md): Understand AAL levels
* [Authentication basics](nist-authentication-basics.md): Terminology and authentication types
* [NIST authenticator types](nist-authenticator-types.md): Authenticator types
* [NIST AALs](nist-about-authenticator-assurance-levels.md): AAL components and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication methods

## Permitted AAL2 authenticator types

The following table has authenticator types permitted for AAL2:

| Azure AD authentication method| NIST authenticator type |
| - | - |
| **Recommended methods** |   |
| Multi-factor Software Certificate (PIN Protected) <br> Windows Hello for Business with software Trusted Platform Module (TPM)| Multi-factor crypto software |
| Hardware protected certificate (smartcard/security key/TPM) <br> FIDO 2 security key <br> Windows Hello for Business with hardware TPM | Multi-factor crypto hardware |
|Microsoft Authenticator app (Passwordless)  | Multi-factor out-of-band
| **Additional methods** |  |
| Password <br> **AND** <br>- Microsoft Authenticator app (Push Notification) <br>- **OR** <br>- Microsoft Authenticator Lite (Push Notification) <br>- **OR** <br>- Phone (SMS) | Memorized secret <br>**AND**<br> Single-factor out-of-band |
| Password <br> **AND** <br>- OATH hardware tokens (preview) <br>- **OR**<br>- Microsoft Authenticator app (OTP)<br>- **OR**<br>- Microsoft Authenticator Lite (OTP)<br>- **OR** <br>- OATH software tokens | Memorized secret <br>**AND** <br>Single-factor OTP|
| Password <br>**AND** <br>- Single-factor software certificate <br>- **OR**<br>- Azure AD joined  with software TPM <br>- **OR**<br>- Hybrid Azure AD joined with software TPM  <br>- **OR**<br>- Compliant mobile device | Memorized secret <br>**AND**<br> Single-factor crypto software |
| Password <br>**AND**<br>- Azure AD joined with hardware TPM <br>- **OR**<br>- Hybrid Azure AD joined with hardware TPM| Memorized secret <br>**AND**<br>Single-factor crypto hardware |

> [!NOTE]
> Today, Microsoft Authenticator by itself is not phishing resistant. To gain protection from external phishing threats when using Microsoft Authenticator you must additionally configure Conditional Access policy requiring a managed device.

### AAL2 recommendations

For AAL2, use multi-factor cryptographic hardware or software authenticators. Passwordless authentication eliminates the greatest attack surface (the password), and offers users a streamlined method to authenticate.

For guidance on selecting a passwordless authentication method, see [Plan a passwordless authentication deployment in Azure Active Directory](../authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment.md). See also, [Windows Hello for Business deployment guide](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-deployment-guide)

## FIPS 140 validation

Use the following sections to learn about FIPS 140 validation.

### Verifier requirements

Azure AD uses the Windows FIPS 140 Level 1 overall validated cryptographic module for authentication cryptographic operations. It's therefore a FIPS 140-compliant verifier required by government agencies.

### Authenticator requirements

Government agency cryptographic authenticators are validated for FIPS 140 Level 1 overall. This requirement isn't for non-governmental agencies. The following Azure AD authenticators meet the requirement when running on [Windows in a FIPS 140-approved mode](/windows/security/threat-protection/fips-140-validation):

* Password

* Azure AD joined with software or with hardware TPM

* Hybrid Azure AD joined with software or with hardware TPM

* Windows Hello for Business with software or with hardware TPM

* Certificate stored in software or hardware (smartcard/security key/TPM)

Microsoft Authenticator app (Push Notification/OTP/passwordless) on iOS uses FIPS 140 level 1 validated cryptographic module and is FIPS 140 compliant. While Microsoft Authenticator app on Android (Push Notification/OTP/passwordless) uses FIPS 140 approved cryptography, it is not FIPS compliant.

For OATH hardware tokens and smartcards we recommend you consult with your provider for current FIPS validation status.

FIDO 2 security key providers are in various stages of FIPS certification. We recommend you review the list of [supported FIDO 2 key vendors](../authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless.md#fido2-security-key-providers). Consult with your provider for current FIPS validation status.

## Reauthentication

For AAL2, the NIST requirement is reauthentication every 12 hours, regardless of user activity. Reauthentication is required after a period of inactivity of 30 minutes or longer. Because the session secret is something you have, presenting something you know, or are, is required.

To meet the requirement for reauthentication, regardless of user activity, Microsoft recommends configuring [user sign-in frequency](../conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-session-lifetime.md) to 12 hours.

With NIST you can use compensating controls to confirm subscriber presence:

* Set session inactivity time out to 30 minutes: Lock the device at the operating system level with Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager, group policy objects (GPOs), or Intune. For the subscriber to unlock it, require local authentication.

* Time out regardless of activity: Run a scheduled task (Configuration Manager, GPO, or Intune) to lock the machine after 12 hours, regardless of activity.

## Man-in-the-middle resistance

Communications between the claimant and Azure AD are over an authenticated, protected channel. This configuration provides resistance to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks and satisfies the MitM resistance requirements for AAL1, AAL2, and AAL3.

## Replay resistance

Azure AD authentication methods at AAL2 use nonce or challenges. The methods resist replay attacks because the verifier detects replayed authentication transactions. Such transactions won't contain needed nonce or timeliness data.
