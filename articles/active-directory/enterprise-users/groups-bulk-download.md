>[!NOTE]
> The columns downloaded are pre-defined

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account in your organization.
1. In Azure AD, select **Groups** > **Download groups**.
1. On the **Groups download** page, select **Start** to receive a CSV file listing your groups.

   ![The download groups command is on the All groups page](./media/groups-bulk-download/bulk-download.png)
