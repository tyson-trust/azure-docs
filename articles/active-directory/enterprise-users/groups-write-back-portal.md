# Group writeback in the Azure portal (preview)

Group writeback is a valuable tool for administrators of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants being synced with on-premises Active Directory groups. Microsoft is now previewing new capabilities for group writeback for tenants with an Azure AD Premium license and Azure AD Connect version 2021 December release or later. In this preview, once you have [enabled Azure AD Connect group writeback](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-group-writeback-v2.md), you can specify in the Azure portal which groups you want to write back and what you’d like each group to write back as. You can write Microsoft 365 groups back to on-premises Active Directory as Distribution, Mail-enabled Security, or Security groups, and write Security groups back as Security groups. Groups are written back with a scope of universal​.

>[!NOTE]
> If you were previously writing Microsoft 365 groups back to on-premises Active Directory as universal distribution groups, they will appear in the Azure portal as not enabled for writeback in both the **Groups** page and in the properties page for a group. These pages display a new property introduced for the preview, “writeback enabled”. This property is not set by the current version of group writeback to ensure backward compatibility with the legacy version of group writeback and to avoid breaking existing customer setups.

To understand the behavior of No writeback in the portal, check the properties of the group in MS Graph.


| Portal | MS Graph| Behavior|
|--------|---------|---------|
| No writeback | isEnabled=false | Group won't be written back to on-premises Active Directory|
| No writeback | IsEnabled = null & onPremisesGroupType = null | If a Microsoft 365 group – it will be written back to on-premises Active Directory as a distribution group. </br> If an Azure AD security group – it will not be written back to on premises Active Directory. |

By default, the **Group writeback state** of groups is set to **No writeback**. This means:

- **Microsoft 365 groups**: if the group ```IsEnabled = null``` and ```onPremisesGroupType = null```, to ensure backwards compatibility with older version of group writeback, the group is written back to your on-premises Active Directory as a distribution group.
- **Azure AD security groups**: if the group ```IsEnabled = null``` and ```onPremisesGroupType = null``` then the group isn't written back to your on-premises Active Directory.

## Show writeback columns

From the **All groups** overview page, you can add the group writeback columns **Target writeback type** and **Writeback enabled** to the view.  The **Target writeback type** and **Writeback enabled** columns are available for the view whether or not you have writeback enabled in Azure AD Connect.

## Writeback column settings

The **Writeback enabled** column allows you to turn off the writeback capability for individual groups. The **Target writeback type** column allows you to specify to which group type you want this cloud group written back in your on-premises Active Directory. For an Azure AD Microsoft 365 group, you can write it back as a security group, a distribution group, or a mail-enabled security group. For an Azure AD security group, you can write it back only as a security group.

## Writeback settings in group properties

You can also configure writeback settings for a group on the property page for the group. There's a **Group writeback state** setting that allows you to turn off writeback for the group or to specify the writeback group type. When **No writeback** is selected, the group isn't written back. If you select one of the other writeback types as an option (for example, Security), then you have:

- Enabled the group for writeback
- Targeted the writeback type as a security group

## Read the Writeback configuration using PowerShell

You can use PowerShell to get a list of writeback enabled group using the following PowerShell Get-MgGroup cmdlet.

```powershell-console
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes @('Group.Read.all')
Select-MgProfile -Name beta
PS D:\> Get-MgGroup -All |Where-Object {$_.writebackConfiguration.isEnabled -Like $true} |Select-Object Displayname,@{N="WriteBackEnabled";E={$_.writebackConfiguration.isEnabled}}

DisplayName WriteBackEnabled
----------- ----------------
CloudGroup1           True
CloudGroup2           True
```

## Read the Writeback configuration using Graph Explorer

Open [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) and use the following endpoint ```https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{Group_ID}```.

Replace the Group_ID with a cloud group ID, and then select on Run query.
In the **Response Preview**, scroll to the end to see the part of the JSON file.

```json
"writebackConfiguration": {
    "isEnabled": true,
    ...
}
```
