# Configure F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager for form-based SSO

Learn to configure F5 BIG-IP Access Policy Manager (APM) and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for secure hybrid access (SHA) to form-based applications. BIG-IP published services for Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) has benefits:

* Improved Zero Trust governance through Azure AD preauthentication and Conditional Access 
  * See [What is Conditional Access?](../conditional-access/overview.md)
  * See [Zero Trust security](../../security/fundamentals/zero-trust.md)
* Full SSO between Azure AD and BIG-IP published services
* Managed identities and access from one control plane
  * See the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal)

* [Enable SSO for an enterprise application](add-application-portal-setup-sso.md)

## Scenario description

For the scenario, there's an internal legacy application configured for form-based authentication (FBA). Ideally, Azure AD manages application access, because legacy lacks modern authentication protocols. Modernization takes time and effort, introducing the risk of downtime. Instead, deploy a BIG-IP between the public internet and the internal application. This configuration gates inbound access to the application.

With a BIG-IP in front of the application, you can overlay the service with Azure AD preauthentication and header-based SSO. The overlay improves application security posture.

## Scenario architecture

The SHA solution has the following components:

* **Application** - BIG-IP published service protected by SHA. 
  * The application validates user credentials against Active Directory
  * Use any directory, including Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services, open source, and so on
* **Azure AD** - Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) identity provider (IdP) that verifies user credentials, Conditional Access, and SSO to the BIG-IP. 
  * With SSO, Azure AD provides attributes to the BIG-IP, including user identifiers
* **BIG-IP** - reverse-proxy and SAML service provider (SP) to the application. 
  * BIG-IP delegating authentication to the SAML IdP then performs header-based SSO to the back-end application. 
  * SSO uses the cached user credentials against other forms-based authentication applications

SHA supports SP- and IdP-initiated flows. The following diagram illustrates the SP-initiated flow.

   ![Diagram of the service-provider initiated flow.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/flow-diagram.png)

1. User connects to application endpoint (BIG-IP).
2. BIG-IP APM access policy redirects user to Azure AD (SAML IdP).
3. Azure AD preauthenticates user and applies enforced Conditional Access policies.
4. User is redirected to BIG-IP (SAML SP) and SSO occurs using issued SAML token. 
5. BIG-IP prompts the user for an application password and stores it in the cache.
6. BIG-IP sends a request to the application and receives a sign on form.
7. The APM scripting fills in the username and password, then submits the form.
8. The web server serves application payload and sends it to the client. 

## Prerequisites

You need the following components:

* An Azure subscription
  * If you don't have one, get an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* For the account, have Azure AD Application Administrator permissions
* A BIG-IP or deploy a BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) in Azure

## BIG-IP configuration

The configuration in this article is a flexible SHA implementation: manual creation of BIG-IP configuration objects. Use this approach for scenarios the Guided Configuration templates don't cover.

   >[!NOTE]
   >Replace example strings or values with those from your environment.

## Register F5 BIG-IP in Azure AD

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

BIG-IP registration is the first step for SSO between entities. The app you create from the F5 BIG-IP gallery template is the relying party, representing the SAML SP for the BIG-IP published application.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with Application Administrator permissions.
2. In the left pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
3. In the left menu, select **Enterprise applications**. 
4. The **All applications** pane opens.
5. The list of applications in your Azure AD tenant appears.
6. On the **Enterprise applications** pane, select **New application**.
7. The **Browse Azure AD Gallery** pane opens.
8. Tiles appear for cloud platforms, on-premises applications, and featured applications. **Featured applications** icons indicate support of federated SSO and provisioning. 
10. In the Azure gallery, search for **F5**.
11. Select **F5 BIG-IP APM Azure AD integration**.
12. Enter a **Name** the new application uses to recognize the application instance. 
13. Select **Add**.
14. Select **Create**.

### Enable SSO to F5 BIG-IP

Configure the BIG-IP registration to fulfill SAML tokens that BIG-IP APM requests.

1. In left menu, in the **Manage** section, select **Single sign-on**.
2. The **Single sign-on** pane appears.
3. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
4. Select **No, I'll save later**.
5. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** pane, select the **pen** icon. 
6. For **Identifier**, replace the value with the BIG-IP published application URL.
7. For **Reply URL**, replace the value, but retain the path for the application SAML SP endpoint. With this configuration, SAML flow operates in IdP-initiated mode. Azure AD issues a SAML assertion, then the user is redirected to the BIG-IP endpoint. 
9. For SP-initiated mode, for **Sign on URL**, enter the application URL.
10. For **Logout Url**, enter the BIG-IP APM single logout (SLO) endpoint prepended by the service host header. Then, BIG-IP APM user sessions end when they sign out of Azure AD. 

   ![Screenshot of URLs in the SAML configuration.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/basic-saml-configuration.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > From Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS) v16 onward, the SAML SLO endpoint is `/saml/sp/profile/redirect/slo`.

11. Select **Save**.
12. Close the SAML configuration pane.
13. Skip the SSO test prompt.
14. Make a note of the **User Attributes & Claims** section properties. Azure AD issues the properties for BIG-IP APM authentication, and SSO to the back-end application.
15. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** pane, select **Download**.
16. The **Federation Metadata XML** file is saved to your computer.

   ![Screenshot a Download option under SAML Signing Certificate.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/saml-certificate.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > Azure AD SAML signing certificates have a lifespan of three years. 

Learn more: [Tutorial: Manage certificates for federated single sign-on](tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on.md)

### Assign users and groups

Azure AD issues tokens for users granted access to an application. To grant specific users and groups application access:

1. On the **F5 BIG-IP application's overview** pane, select **Assign Users and groups**.
2. Select **+ Add user/group**.
3. Select the users and groups you want.
4. Select **Assign**.   

## BIG-IP advanced configuration

Use the following instructions to configure BIG-IP.

### Configure SAML service provider settings

SAML SP settings define the SAML SP properties that the APM uses to overlay the legacy application with SAML preauthentication. To configure them:

1. Select **Access** > **Federation** > **SAML Service Provider**.
2. Select **Local SP Services**.
3. Select **Create**.

   ![Screenshot of the Create option on the the SAML Service Provider tab.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/f5-forms-configuration.png)

4. On the **Create New SAML SP Service** pane, for **Name** and **Entity ID**, enter the defined name and entity ID.

   ![Screenshot of the Name and Entity ID fields under Create New SAML SP Service.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/saml-sp-service.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > **SP Name Settings** values are required if the entity ID doesn't match the hostname portion of the published URL. Or, values are required if the entity ID isn't in regular hostname-based URL format. 

5. If the entity ID is `urn:myvacation:contosoonline`, enter the application external scheme and hostname.

### Configure an external IdP connector

A SAML IdP connector defines settings for the BIG-IP APM to trust Azure AD as its SAML IdP. The settings connect the SAML service provider to a SAML IdP, which establishes the federation trust between the APM and Azure AD. 

To configure the connector:

1. Select the new SAML service provider object.
2. Select **Bind/UnbBind IdP Connectors**.

   ![Screenshot of the Bind Unbind IdP Connectors option on the SAML Service Provider tab.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/local-services.png)

3. In the **Create New IdP Connector** list, select **From Metadata**.

   ![Screenshot of the From Metadata option in the Create New IdP Connector dropdown list.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/from-metadata.png)
  
4. On the **Create New SAML IdP Connector** pane, browse for the Federation Metadata XML file you downloaded.
5. Enter an **Identity Provider Name** for the APM object that represents the external SAML IdP. For example, MyVacation\_AzureAD.

   ![Screenshot of Select File and Identity Provider name fields on Create New SAML IdP Connector.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/new-idp-saml-connector.png)

6. Select **Add New Row**.
7. Select the new **SAML IdP Connector**.
8. Select **Update**.
  
   ![Screenshot of the Update option.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/add-new-row.png)

9. Select **OK**.

   ![Screenshot of the Edit SAML IdPs that use this SP dialog.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/edit-saml-idp-using-sp.png)

### Configure forms-based SSO

Create an APM SSO object for FBA SSO to back-end applications. 

Perform FBA SSO in client-initiated mode or BIG-IP-initiated mode. Both methods emulate a user sign-on by injecting credentials into the username and password tags. The form is then autosubmitted. Users provide password to access an FBA application. The password is cached and reused for other FBA applications.

1. Select **Access** > **Single Sign-on**.
2. Select **Forms Based**.
3. Select **Create**.
4. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name. For example, Contoso\FBA\sso.
5. For **Use SSO Template**, select **None**.
6. For **Username Source**, enter the username source to prefill the password collection form. The default `session.sso.token.last.username` works well, because it has the signed-in user Azure AD UPN.
7. For **Password Source**, keep the default `session.sso.token.last.password`, the APM variable BIG-IP uses to cache user passwords. 

   ![Screenshot of Name and Use SSO Template options under New SSO Configuration.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/new-sso-configuration.png)

8. For **Start URI**, enter the FBA application logon URI. If the request URI matches this URI value, the APM form-based authentication executes SSO.
9. For **Form Action**, leave it blank. Then, the original request URL is used for SSO.
10. For **Form Parameter for Username**, enter the sign in form username field element. Use the browser dev tools to determine the element.
11. For **Form Parameter for Password**, enter the sign in form password field element. Use the browser dev tools to determine the element.

   ![Screenshot of Start URI, Form Parameter For User Name, and Form Parameter For Password fields.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/sso-method-configuration.png)

### Configure an access profile

An access profile binds the APM elements that manage access to BIG-IP virtual servers, including access policies, SSO configuration, and UI settings.

1. Select **Access** > **Profiles / Policies**.
2. Select **Access Profiles (Per-Session Policies)**.
3. Select **Create**.
4. Enter a **Name**.
5. For **Profile Type**, select **All**.
6. For **SSO Configuration**, select the FBA SSO configuration object you created.
7. For **Accepted Language**, select at least one language. 

   ![Screenshot of options and selections on Access Profiles Per Session Policies, New Profile.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/create-new-access-profile.png)

8. In the **Per-Session Policy** column, for the profile, select **Edit**.
9. The APM Visual Policy Editor starts.

   ![Screenshot of the Edit option in the Per-Session Policy column.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/edit-per-session-policy.png)

10. Under **fallback**, select the **+** sign.

   ![Screenshot of the APM Visual Policy Editor plus-sign option under fallback.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/vpe-launched.png)

11. In the pop-up, select **Authentication**.
12. Select **SAML Auth**.
13. Select **Add Item**.

   ![Screenshot of the SAML Auth option.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/saml-auth-add-item.png)

14. On **SAML authentication SP**, change the **Name** to **Azure AD Auth**.
15. In the **AAA Server** dropdown, enter the SAML service provider object you created.

   ![Screenshot showing the Azure AD Authentication server settings.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/auth-server.png)

16. On the **Successful** branch, select the **+** sign.

26. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Save option on the Properties tab.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/save-sso-credential-mapping.png)

27. In the upper **Deny** box, select the link.
28. The **Successful** branch changes to **Allow**.
29. Select **Save**.

#### (Optional) Configure attribute mappings

You can add a LogonID_Mapping configuration. Then, the BIG-IP active sessions list has the signed-in user UPN, not a session number. Use this information for analyzing logs or troubleshooting.

1. For the **SAML Auth Successful** branch, select the **+** sign.
2. In the pop-up, select **Assignment**.
3. Select **Variable Assign**.
4. Select **Add Item**.

9.  For Session Variable, user `session.saml.last.identity`.
10. Select **Finished**.
11. Select **Save**.
12. Select **Apply Access Policy**.
13. Close the Visual Policy Editor.

   ![Screenshot of of the access policy on Apply Access Policy.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/apply-access-policy.png)

### Configure a back-end pool

To enable BIG-IP to forward client traffic correctly, create a BIG-IP node object that represents the back-end server that hosts your application. Then, place that node in a BIG-IP server pool.

1. Select **Local Traffic** > **Pools**.
2. Select **Pool List**.
3. Select **Create**. 
4. Enter a **Name** for a server pool object. For example, MyApps_VMs.

   ![Screenshot of the Name field under New Pool.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/pool-list.png)

5. For **Node Name**, enter a server display name. This server hosts the back-end web application.
6. For **Address**, enter the application server host IP address.
7. For **Service Port** enter the HTTP/S port the application is listening on.

   ![Screenshot of the Node Name, Address, Service Port fields and the Add option.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/pool-member.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >Health monitors require configuration this article doesn't cover. Go to support.f5.com for [K13397: Overview of HTTP health monitor request formatting for the BIG-IP DNS system](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13397).  

### Configure a virtual server

A virtual server is a BIG-IP data-plane object represented by a virtual IP address. The server listens for client requests to the application. Any received traffic is processed and evaluated against the APM access profile associated with the virtual server. The traffic is directed according to policy.

To configure a virtual server:

1. Select **Local Traffic** > **Virtual Servers**.
2. Select **Virtual Server List**.
3. Select **Create**.
4. Enter a **Name**.
5. For **Destination Address/Mask**, select **Host** and enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address. The address receives client traffic for the published back-end application. 
6. For **Service Port**, select **Port**, enter **443**, and select **HTTPS**.

   ![Screenshot of the Name, Destination Address, and Service Port fields and options.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/virtual-server.png)  
 
7. For **HTTP Profile (Client)**, select **http**.
8. For **SSL Profile (Client)**, select the profile you created, or leave the default for testing. This option enables a virtual server for Transport Layer Security (TLS) to publish services over HTTPS. 

   ![Screenshot of HTTP Profile Client and SSL Profile Client options.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/ssl-profile.png)

9. For **Source Address Translation**, select **Auto Map**.

   ![Screenshot of the Auto Map selection for Source Address Translation.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/auto-map.png)

10. Under **Access Policy**, in the **Access Profile** box, enter the name you created. This action binds the Azure AD SAML preauthentication profile and FBA SSO policy to the virtual server.

   ![Screenshot of the Access Profile entry under Access Policy.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/access-policy.png)

11. Under **Resources**, for **Default Pool**, select the back-end pool objects you created. 
12. Select **Finished**.

   ![Screenshot of the Default Pool option under Resources.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/default-pool.png)

### Configure session management settings

BIG-IP session management settings define conditions for sessions termination and continuation. Create policy in this area. 

1. Go to **Access Policy**.
2. Select **Access Profiles**.
3. Select **Access Profile**.
4. From the list, select your application.

If you defined a single logout URI value in Azure AD, IdP-initiated sign out from MyApps ends the client and the BIG-IP APM session. The imported application federation metadata XML file provides the APM with the Azure AD SAML endpoint for SP-initiated sign out. Ensure the APM responds correctly to a user sign out.

If there's no BIG-IP web portal, users can't instruct the APM to sign out. If the user signs out of the application, BIG-IP is oblivious. The application session can be reinstated through SSO. For SP-initiated sign out, ensure sessions terminate securely.

You can add an SLO function to your application **sign out** button. This function redirects the client to the Azure AD SAML sign out endpoint. To locate SAML sign out endpoint, go to **App Registrations > Endpoints**.

If you can't change the app, have the BIG-IP listen for the app sign out call and trigger SLO.

* [K12056: Overview of the Logout URI Include option](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K12056)

## Published application

Your application is published and accessible with SHA with the app URL or Microsoft portals.

The application appears as a target resource in Conditional Access. Learn more: [Building a Conditional Access policy](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policies.md).

For increased security, block direct access to the application, enforcing a path through the BIG-IP.

## Test

1. With a browser, connect to the application external URL, or in My Apps, select the application icon. 
2. Authenticate to Azure AD.
3. You’re redirected to the BIG-IP endpoint for the application.
4. The password prompt appears. 
5. The APM fills the username with the UPN from Azure AD. The username is read-only for session consistency. Hide this field, if needed.

   ![Screenshot of the sign in page.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/secured-sso.png)

6. The information is submitted.
7. You're signed in to the application.

   ![Screenshot of Welcome page.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/welcome-message.png)

## Troubleshoot

When troubleshooting, consider the following information

* BIG-IP performs FBA SSO as it parses the sign in form at the URI
  * BIG-IP seeks the username and password element tags from your configuration
* Ensure element tags are consistent, or SSO fails
* Complex forms generated dynamically might require dev tool analysis to understand the sign in form
* Client-initiated is better for sign in pages with multiple forms
  * You can specify form name and customize the JavaScript form handler logic
* Both FBA SSO methods optimize user experience and security by hiding form interactions:
  * You can validate if the credentials are injected 
  * In client-initiated mode, disable form autosubmission in your SSO profile
  * Use dev tools to disable the two style properties that prevent the sign in page from appearing

  ![Screenshot of the Properties page.](./media/f5-big-ip-forms-advanced/properties.png)

### Increase log verbosity

BIG-IP logs contain information to isolating authentication and SSO issues. Increase the log verbosity level:

1. Go to **Access Policy** > **Overview**.
2. Select **Event Logs**.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Select the row of your published application.
5. Select **Edit**.
6. Select **Access System Logs**.
7. In the SSO list, select **Debug**.
8. Select **OK**. 
9. Reproduce the issue.
10. Review the logs.

Revert the settings otherwise there's excessive data.

### BIG-IP error message

If a BIG-IP error appears after Azure AD preauthentication, the issue might relate to Azure AD and BIG-IP SSO.

1. Go to **Access** > **Overview**.
2. Select **Access reports**.
3. Run the report for the last hour.
4. Review the logs for clues. 

Use the **View session variables** link for your session to determine if the APM receives expected Azure AD claims.

### No BIG-IP error message

If no BIG-IP error message appears, the issue might relate to the back-end request, or BIG-IP-to-application SSO. 

1. Select **Access Policy** > **Overview**.
2. Select **Active Sessions**.
3. Select the active session link.

Use the **View Variables** link in this location to help determine root cause, particularly if the APM fails to obtain correct user identifier and password.
