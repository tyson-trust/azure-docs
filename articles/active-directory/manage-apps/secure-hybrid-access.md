# Secure hybrid access: Protect legacy apps with Azure Active Directory

In this article, learn to protect your on-premises and cloud legacy authentication applications by connecting them to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

* **[Application Proxy](#secure-hybrid-access-with-application-proxy)**:
  * [Remote access to on-premises applications through Azure AD Application Proxy](../app-proxy/application-proxy.md)
  * Protect users, apps, and data in the cloud and on-premises 
  * [Use it to publish on-premises web applications externally](../app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md)
  
* **[Secure hybrid access through Azure AD partner integrations](#partner-integrations-for-apps-on-premises-and-legacy-authentication)**:
  * [Pre-built solutions](#secure-hybrid-access-through-azure-ad-partner-integrations)
  * [Apply Conditional Access policies per application](secure-hybrid-access-integrations.md#apply-conditional-access-policies)
 
In addition to Application Proxy, you can strengthen your security posture with [Azure AD Conditional Access](../conditional-access/overview.md) and [Identity Protection](../identity-protection/overview-identity-protection.md). 

## Single sign-on and multi-factor authentication

With Azure AD as an identity provider (IdP), you can use modern authentication and authorization methods like [single sign-on (SSO)](what-is-single-sign-on.md) and [Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md) to secure legacy, on-premises applications.

## Secure hybrid access with Application Proxy

Use Application Proxy to protect users, apps, and data in the cloud, and on premises. Use this tool for secure remote access to on-premises web applications. Users donâ€™t need to use a virtual private network (VPN); they connect to applications from devices with SSO.

* [Tutorial: Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure AD](../app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md)

* [Using Azure AD Application Proxy to publish on-premises apps for remote users](../app-proxy/what-is-application-proxy.md)

### Application publishing and access management

Use Application Proxy remote access as a service to publish applications to users outside the corporate network. Help improve your cloud access management without requiring modification to your on-premises applications. Plan an [Azure AD Application Proxy deployment](../app-proxy/application-proxy-deployment-plan.md).

## Partner integrations for apps: on-premises and legacy authentication

Microsoft partners with various companies that deliver pre-built solutions for on-premises applications, and applications that use legacy authentication. The following diagram illustrates a user flow from sign-in to secure access to apps and data.
