# Tutorial: Configure Datawiza to enable Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication and single sign-on to Oracle PeopleSoft

In this tutorial, learn how to enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) single sign-on (SSO) and Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an
Oracle PeopleSoft application using Datawiza Access Proxy (DAP).

Benefits of integrating applications with Azure AD using DAP:

* [Embrace proactive security with Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) - a security model that adapts to modern environments and embraces hybrid workplace, while it protects people, devices, apps, and data
* [Azure Active Directory single sign-on](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/active-directory-sso/#overview) - secure and seamless access for users and apps, from any location, using a device
* [How it works: Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication](../authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks.md) - users are prompted during sign-in for forms of identification, such as a code on their cellphone or a fingerprint scan
* [What is Conditional Access?](../conditional-access/overview.md) - policies are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action
* [Easy authentication and authorization in Azure AD with no-code Datawiza](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/17/easy-authentication-and-authorization-in-azure-active-directory-with-no-code-datawiza/) - use web applications such as: Oracle JDE, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Sibel, and home-grown apps
* Use the [Datawiza Cloud Management Console](https://console.datawiza.com) (DCMC) - manage access to applications in public clouds and on-premises

## Scenario description

This scenario focuses on Oracle PeopleSoft application integration using HTTP authorization headers to manage access to protected content.

In legacy applications, due to the absence of modern protocol support, a direct integration with Azure AD SSO is difficult. Datawiza Access Proxy (DAP) bridges the gap between the legacy application and the modern ID control plane, through protocol transitioning. DAP lowers integration overhead, saves engineering time, and improves application security.

## Scenario architecture

The scenario solution has the following components:

* **Azure AD** - identity and access management service that helps users sign in and access external and internal resources
* **Datawiza Access Proxy (DAP)** - container-based reverse-proxy that implements OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth, or Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for user sign-in flow. It passes identity transparently to applications through HTTP headers.
* **Datawiza Cloud Management Console (DCMC)** - administrators manage DAP with UI and RESTful APIs to configure DAP and access control policies
* **Oracle PeopleSoft application** - legacy application to be protected by Azure AD and DAP

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met.

* An Azure subscription
  * If you don't have one, you can get an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An Azure AD tenant linked to the Azure subscription
  * See, [Quickstart: Create a new tenant in Azure Active Directory](../fundamentals/create-new-tenant.md)
* Docker and Docker Compose
  * Go to docs.docker.com to [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker) and [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)
* User identities synchronized from an on-premises directory to Azure AD, or created in Azure AD and flowed back to an on-premises directory
  * See, [Azure AD Connect sync: Understand and customize synchronization](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sync-whatis.md)
* An account with Azure AD and the Application Administrator role
  * See, [Azure AD built-in roles, all roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md#all-roles)
* An Oracle PeopleSoft environment
* (Optional) An SSL web certificate to publish services over HTTPS. You can use default Datawiza self-signed certs for testing.

## SSO and HTTP headers

DAP gets user attributes from the identity provider (IdP) and passes them to the upstream application with a header or cookie.

The Oracle PeopleSoft application needs to recognize the user. Using a name, the application instructs DAP to pass the values from the IdP to the application through the HTTP header.

1. In Oracle PeopleSoft, from the left navigation, select **Applications**.
2. Select the **Attribute Pass** subtab.
3. For **Field**, select **email**.
4. For **Expected**, select **PS_SSO_UID**.
5. For **Type**, select **Header**.
