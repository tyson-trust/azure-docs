# Tutorial: Migrate Okta federation to Azure Active Directory-managed authentication

In this tutorial, learn to federate Office 365 tenants with Okta for single sign-on (SSO).

You can migrate federation to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in a staged manner to ensure a good authentication experience for users. In a staged migration, you can test reverse federation access to remaining Okta SSO applications.

## Prerequisites

- An Office 365 tenant federated to Okta for SSO
- An Azure AD Connect server or Azure AD Connect cloud provisioning agents configured for user provisioning to Azure AD

## Configure Azure AD Connect for authentication

Customers that federate their Office 365 domains with Okta might not have a valid authentication method in Azure AD. Before you migrate to managed authentication, validate Azure AD Connect and configure it for user sign-in.

Set up the sign-in method:

* **Password hash synchronization** - an extension of the directory synchronization feature implemented by Azure AD Connect server or cloud-provisioning agents
  * Use this feature to sign in to Azure AD services like Microsoft 365
  * Sign in to the service with the password to sign in to the on-premises Active Directory instance
  * See, [What is password hash synchronization with Azure AD?](../hybrid/connect/whatis-phs.md)
* **Pass-through authentication** - sign in to on-premises and cloud applications with the same passwords 
  * When users sign in through Azure AD, the pass-through authentication agent validates passwords against the on-premises AD
  * See, [User sign-in with Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-pta.md)
* **Seamless SSO** - signs in users on corporate desktops connected to the corporate network
  * Users have access to cloud applications without other on-premises components
  * See, [Azure AD seamless SSO](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sso.md)

To create a seamless authentication user experience in Azure AD, deploy seamless SSO to password hash synchronization or pass-through authentication.

For prerequisites of seamless SSO see, [Quickstart: Azure Active Directory Seamless single sign-on](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-sso-quick-start.md#step-1-check-the-prerequisites).

For this tutorial, you configure password hash synchronization and seamless SSO.

### Configure Azure AD Connect for password hash synchronization and seamless SSO

1. On the Azure AD Connect server, open the **Azure AD Connect** app.
2. Select **Configure**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure AD icon and the Configure button in the Azure AD Connect app.](media/migrate-okta-federation/configure.png)

3. Select **Change user sign-in**.
4. Select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure AD Connect app with the page for changing user sign-in.](media/migrate-okta-federation/change-user-signin.png)

5. Enter Global Administrator credentials.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure A D Connect app that shows where to enter Global Administrator credentials.](media/migrate-okta-federation/global-admin-credentials.png)

6. The server is configured for federation with Okta. Change the selection to **Password Hash Synchronization**. 
7. Select **Enable single sign-on**.
8. Select **Next**.
9. For the local on-premises system, enter the domain administrator credentials. 
10. Select **Next**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure AD Connect app with settings for user sign-in.](media/migrate-okta-federation/domain-admin-credentials.png)

11. On the final page, select **Configure**.

   ![Screenshot of the Ready to configure page of the Azure AD Connect app.](media/migrate-okta-federation/update-connect-server.png)

12. Ignore the warning for hybrid Azure AD join. 

   ![Screenshot of the Azure AD Connect app. The hybrid Azure AD join warning appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/reconfigure-device-options.png)

## Configure staged rollout features

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](~/articles/active-directory/includes/portal-update.md)]

Before you test defederating a domain, in Azure AD use a cloud authentication staged rollout to test defederating users. 

Learn more: [Migrate to cloud authentication using Staged Rollout](../hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-staged-rollout.md)

After you enable password hash sync and seamless SSO on the Azure AD Connect server, configure a staged rollout:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), then select **View** or **Manage Azure Active Directory**.

   ![Screenshot of the Azure portal with welcome message.](media/migrate-okta-federation/portal.png)

2. On the **Azure Active Directory** menu, select **Azure AD Connect**. 
3. Confirm **Password Hash Sync** is enabled in the tenant.
4. Select **Enable staged rollout for managed user sign-in**.

   ![Screenshot of the staged rollout option.](media/migrate-okta-federation/enable-staged-rollout.png)

5. After the server configuration, **Password Hash Sync** setting can change to **On**. 
6. Enable the setting.
7. **Seamless single sign-on** is **Off**. If you enable it, an error appears because it's enabled in the tenant.
8. Select **Manage groups**.

   ![Screenshot of the Enable staged rollout features page in the Azure portal. A Manage groups button appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/password-hash-sync.png)

9. Add a group to the password hash sync rollout. In the following example, the security group starts with 10 members.

   ![Screenshot of the Manage groups for Password Hash Sync page in the Azure portal. A group is in a table.](media/migrate-okta-federation/example-security-group.png)

10. Wait about 30 minutes for the feature to take effect in your tenant. 
11. When the feature takes effect, users aren't redirected to Okta when attempting to access Office 365 services.

The staged rollout feature has some unsupported scenarios:

* Legacy authentication protocols such as POP3 and SMTP aren't supported.
* If you configured hybrid Azure AD join for Okta, the hybrid Azure AD join flows go to Okta until the domain is defederated. 
  * A sign-on policy remains in Okta for legacy authentication of hybrid Azure AD join Windows clients.

## Create an Okta app in Azure AD

Users that converted to managed authentication might need access to applications in Okta. For user access to those applications, register an Azure AD application that links to the Okta home page.

Configure the enterprise application registration for Okta.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), then under **Manage Azure Active Directory**, select **View**.
2. On the left menu, under **Manage**, select **Enterprise applications**.

   ![Screenshot of the left menu of the Azure portal.](media/migrate-okta-federation/enterprise-application.png)

3. On the **All applications** menu, select **New application**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the All applications page in the Azure portal. A new application is visible.](media/migrate-okta-federation/new-application.png)

4. Select **Create your own application**. 
5. On the menu, name the Okta app.
6. Select **Register an application you're working on to integrate with Azure AD**. 
7. Select **Create**.
8. Select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD Directory - Multitenant)**.
9. Select **Register**.

   ![Screenshot of Register an application.](media/migrate-okta-federation/register-change-application.png)

10. On the Azure AD menu, select **App registrations**. 
11. Open the created registration.

   ![Screenshot of the App registrations page in the Azure portal. The new app registration appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/app-registration.png)

12. Record the Tenant ID and Application ID.

   >[!Note]
   >You need the Tenant ID and Application ID to configure the identity provider in Okta.

   ![Screenshot of the Okta Application Access page in the Azure portal. The Tenant ID and Application ID appear.](media/migrate-okta-federation/record-ids.png)

13. On the left menu, select **Certificates & secrets**. 
14. Select **New client secret**. 
15. Enter a secret name.
16. Enter its expiration date.
17. Record the secret value and ID.

   >[!NOTE]
   >The value and ID don't appear later. If you don't record the information, you must regenerate a secret.

   ![Screenshot of the Certificates and secrets page. The value and I D of the secret appear.](media/migrate-okta-federation/record-secrets.png)

18. On the left menu, select **API permissions**. 
19. Grant the application access to the OpenID Connect (OIDC) stack.
20. Select **Add a permission**.
21. Select **Microsoft Graph**
22. Select **Delegated permissions**.
23. In the OpenID permissions section, add **email**, **openid**, and **profile**. 
24. Select **Add permissions**.
25. Select **Grant admin consent for \<tenant domain name>**.
26. Wait for the **Granted** status to appear.

    ![Screenshot of the API permissions page with a message for granted consent.](media/migrate-okta-federation/grant-consent.png)

27. On the left menu, select **Branding**. 
28. For **Home page URL**, add your user application home page.

    ![Screenshot of the Branding page in the Azure portal.](media/migrate-okta-federation/add-branding.png)

29. In the Okta administration portal, to add a new identity provider, select **Security** then **Identity Providers**. 
30. Select **Add Microsoft**.

    ![Screenshot of the Okta administration portal. Add Microsoft appears in the Add Identity Provider list.](media/migrate-okta-federation/configure-idp.png)

31. On the **Identity Provider** page, enter the Application ID in the **Client ID** field. 
32. Enter the client secret in the **Client Secret** field.
33. Select **Show Advanced Settings**. By default, this configuration ties the user principal name (UPN) in Okta to the UPN in Azure AD for reverse-federation access.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >If UPNs in Okta and Azure AD don't match, select an attribute that's common between users.

34. Complete autoprovisioning selections. 
35. By default, if no match appears for an Okta user, the system attempts to provision the user in Azure AD. If you migrated provisioning away from Okta, select **Redirect to Okta sign-in page**.

    ![Screenshot of the General Settings page in the Okta admin portal. The option for redirecting to the Okta sign-in page appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/redirect-okta.png)

You created the identity provider (IDP). Send users to the correct IDP.

1. On the **Identity Providers** menu, select **Routing Rules** then **Add Routing Rule**. 
2. Use one of the available attributes in the Okta profile.
3. To direct sign-ins from devices and IPs to Azure AD, set up the policy seen in following image. In this example, the **Division** attribute is unused on all Okta profiles. It's a good choice for IDP routing.

    ![Screenshot of the Edit Rule page in the Okta admin portal. A rule definition that involves the division attribute appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/division-idp-routing.png)

4. Record the redirect URI to add it to the application registration.

    ![Screenshot of the redirect URI location.](media/migrate-okta-federation/application-registration.png)

5. On the application registration, on the left menu, select **Authentication**. 
6. Select **Add a platform**
7. Select **Web**.
8. Add the redirect URI you recorded in the IDP in Okta. 
9. Select **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**.

    ![Screenshot of the Configure Web page in the Azure portal. A redirect URI appears. The access and I D tokens are selected.](media/migrate-okta-federation/access-id-tokens.png)

10. In the admin console, select **Directory**.
11. Select **People**. 
12. Select a test user to edit the profile.
13. In the profile, add **ToAzureAD**. See the following image. 
14. Select **Save**.

    ![Screenshot of the Okta admin portal. Profile settings appear, and the Division box has ToAzureAD.](media/migrate-okta-federation/profile-editing.png)

15. Sign in to the [Microsoft 356 portal](https://portal.office.com) as the modified user. If your user isn't in the managed authentication pilot, your action enters a loop. To exit the loop, add the user to the managed authentication experience.

## Test Okta app access on pilot members

After you configure the Okta app in Azure AD and configure the IDP in the Okta portal, assign the application to users.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** then **Enterprise applications**.
2. Select the app registration you created.
3. Go to **Users and groups**. 
4. Add the group that correlates with the managed authentication pilot.

   >[!NOTE]
   >You can add users and groups from the **Enterprise applications** page. You can't add users from the **App registrations** menu.

   ![Screenshot of the Users and groups page of the Azure portal. A group called Managed Authentication Staging Group appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/add-group.png)

5. Wait about 15 minutes.
6. Sign in as a managed authentication pilot user.
7. Go to [My Apps](https://myapplications.microsoft.com).

   ![Screenshot of the My Apps gallery. An icon for Okta Application Access appears.](media/migrate-okta-federation/my-applications.png)

8. To return to the Okta home page, select the **Okta Application Access** tile.

## Test managed authentication on pilot members

After you configure the Okta reverse-federation app, ask users to conduct testing on the managed authentication experience. We recommend you configure company branding to help users recognize the tenant.

Learn more: [Configure your company branding](../fundamentals/how-to-customize-branding.md).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >Before you defederate the domains from Okta, identify needed Conditional Access policies. You can secure your environment before cut-off. See, [Tutorial: Migrate Okta sign-on policies to Azure AD Conditional Access](migrate-okta-sign-on-policies-conditional-access.md).

## Defederate Office 365 domains

When your organization is comfortable with the managed authentication experience, you can defederate your domain from Okta. To begin, use the following commands to connect to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. If you don't have the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module, download it by entering `install-module MSOnline`.

```PowerShell

import-module MSOnline
Connect-MgGraph
New-MgDomainFederationConfiguration 
-domainname yourdomain.com -authentication managed

```

After you set the domain to managed authentication, you've defederated your Office 365 tenant from Okta while maintaining user access to the Okta home page.
