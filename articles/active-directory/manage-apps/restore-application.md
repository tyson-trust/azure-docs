# Restore an enterprise application in Azure AD

In this article, you learn how to restore a soft deleted enterprise application in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Soft deleted enterprise applications can be restored from the recycle bin within the first 30 days after their deletion. After the 30-day window, the enterprise application is permanently deleted and can't be restored.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you deleted an [application registration](../develop/howto-remove-app.md) in its home tenant through app registrations in the Azure portal, the enterprise application, which is its corresponding service principal also got deleted. If you restore the deleted application registration through the Azure portal, its corresponding service principal, is also restored. You'll therefore be able to recover the service principal's previous configurations, except its previous policies such as Conditional Access policies, which aren't restored.

[!INCLUDE [portal updates](../includes/portal-update.md)]

## Prerequisites

To restore an enterprise application, you need:

- An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
- A [soft deleted enterprise application](delete-application-portal.md) in your tenant.

Take the following steps to recover a recently deleted enterprise application. For more information on frequently asked questions about deletion and recovery of applications, see [Deleting and recovering applications FAQs](delete-recover-faq.yml).

:::zone pivot="aad-powershell"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you're using the AzureAD module. This is important if you've installed both the [AzureAD](/powershell/module/azuread/?preserve-view=true&view=azureadps-2.0) module and the AzureADPreview module.
1. Run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    Remove-Module AzureADPreview
    Import-Module AzureAD
    ```

1. Connect to Azure AD PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzureAD
   ```

1. To view the recently deleted enterprise application, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureADMSDeletedDirectoryObject -Id <id>
   ```

Replace ID with the object ID of the service principal that you want to restore.
 
:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="ms-powershell"

1. Run `connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All"` and sign in with a Global Administrator user account.

1. To view the recently deleted enterprise applications, run the following command:
   
   ```powershell
   Get-MgDirectoryDeletedItem -DirectoryObjectId <id>
   ```
Replace ID with the object ID of the service principal that you want to restore.

:::zone-end

:::zone pivot="ms-graph"

View and restore recently deleted enterprise applications using [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).

To get the list of deleted enterprise applications in your tenant, run the following query.
   
   ```http
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal
   ```
From the list of deleted service principals generated, record the ID of the enterprise application you want to restore.

Alternatively, if you want to get the specific enterprise application that was deleted, fetch the deleted service principal and filter the results by the client's application ID (appId) property using the following syntax:

`https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal?$filter=appId eq '{appId}'`. Once you've retrieved the object ID of the deleted service principal, proceed to restore it.
