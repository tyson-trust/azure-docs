# Manage a dev box project
A project is the point of access to Microsoft Dev Box for the development team members. A project contains dev box pools, which specify the dev box definitions and network connections used when dev boxes are created. Dev managers can configure the project with dev box pools that specify dev box definitions appropriate for their team's workloads. Dev box users create dev boxes from the dev box pools they have access to through their project memberships.

Each project is associated with a single dev center. When you associate a project with a dev center, all the settings at the dev center level will be applied to the project automatically. 

## Project admins

Microsoft Dev Box makes it possible for you to delegate administration of projects to a member of the project team. Project administrators can assist with the day-to-day management of projects for their team, like creating and managing dev box pools. To provide users permissions to manage projects, add them to the DevCenter Project Admin role. The tasks in this quickstart can be performed by project admins. 

To learn how to add a user to the Project Admin role, refer to [Provide access to projects for project admins](how-to-project-admin.md).

## Provide access to a dev box project
Before users can create dev boxes based on the dev box pools in a project, you must provide access for them through a role assignment. The Dev Box User role enables dev box users to create, manage and delete their own dev boxes. You must have sufficient permissions to a project before you can add users to it.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
 
1. In the search box, type *Projects* and then select **Projects** from the list.

1. Select the project you want to provide your team members access to.
 
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-projects/projects-grid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of existing projects.":::

1. Select **Access Control (IAM)** from the left menu.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
    
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Role** | Select **DevCenter Dev Box User**. |
    | **Assign access to** | Select **User, group, or service principal**. |
    | **Members** | Select the users or groups you want to have access to the project. |

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-manage-dev-box-projects/add-role-assignment-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add role assignment pane.":::

The user will now be able to view the project and all the pools within it. They can create dev boxes from any of the pools and manage those dev boxes from the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

To assign administrative access to a project, select the DevCenter Project Admin role. For more details on how to add a user to the Project Admin role, refer to [Provide access to projects for project admins](how-to-project-admin.md).
