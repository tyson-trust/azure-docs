# How to hibernate your dev box

Hibernation is a power-saving state that saves your running applications to your hard disk and then shuts down the virtual machine (VM). When you resume the VM, all your previous work is restored. 

You can hibernate your dev box through the developer portal or the CLI. You can't hibernate your dev box from the dev box itself.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dev Box Hibernation is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Hibernate your dev box using the developer portal 

Hibernate your dev box through the developer portal: 

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).
 
1. On the dev box you want to hibernate, on the more options menu, select **Hibernate**. 
 
Dev boxes that support hibernation will show the **Hibernate** option. Dev boxes that only support shutdown will show the **Shutdown** option.

## Resume your dev box using the developer portal 

Resume your Dev box through the developer portal: 

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).
 
1. On the dev box you want to resume, on the more options menu, select **Resume**. 

In addition, you can also double select on your dev box  in the list of VMs you see in the "Remote Desktop" app. Your dev box  automatically starts up and resumes from a hibernating state. 

## Hibernate your dev box using the CLI

You can use the CLI to hibernate your dev box:

```azurecli-interactive
az devcenter dev dev-box stop --name <YourDevBoxName> --dev-center-name <YourDevCenterName> --project-name <YourProjectName> --user-id "me" --hibernate false
```

To learn more about managing your dev box from the CLI, see: [devcenter reference](/cli/azure/devcenter/dev/dev-box?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true). 

## Troubleshooting

**My dev box doesn't resume from hibernated state. Attempts to connect to it fail and I receive an error from the RDP app.** 

If your machine is unresponsive, it may have stalled either while going into hibernation or resuming from hibernation, you can manually reboot your dev box. 

To shut down your dev box, either 

- Developer portal - Go to the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal), select your DevBox, and on the more options menu, select **Shut down**. 
- CLI - `az devcenter dev dev-box stop --name <YourDevBoxName> --dev-center-name <YourDevCenterName> --project-name <YourProjectName> --user-id "me" --hibernate false`

**When my dev box resumes from a hibernated state, all my open windows were gone.** 

Dev Box Hibernation is a preview feature, and you might run into reliability issues. Enable AutoSave on your applications to minimize the impact of session loss. 

**I changed some settings on one of my dev boxes and it no longer hibernates. My other dev boxes hibernate without issues. What could be the problem?**

Some settings aren't compatible with hibernation and prevent your dev box from hibernating. To learn about these settings, see: [Settings not compatible with hibernation](how-to-configure-dev-box-hibernation.md#settings-not-compatible-with-hibernation).
