# Manage a dev box definition

A dev box definition is a Microsoft Dev Box resource that specifies a source image, compute size, and storage size.

Depending on their task, development teams have different software, configuration, compute, and storage requirements. You can create a new dev box definition to fulfill each team's needs. There's no limit to the number of dev box definitions that you can create, and you can use dev box definitions across multiple projects in a dev center.

## Permissions

To manage a dev box definition, you need the following permissions:

|Action|Permissions required|
|-----|-----|
|Create, delete, or update a dev box definition|Owner, Contributor, or Write permissions on the dev center in which you want to create the dev box definition. |

## Sources of images

When you create a dev box definition, you can choose a preconfigured image from Azure Marketplace or a custom image from Azure Compute Gallery.

### Azure Marketplace

Azure Marketplace gives you quick access to various images, including images that are preconfigured with productivity tools like Microsoft Teams and provide optimal performance.

When you're selecting an Azure Marketplace image, consider using an image that has the latest version of Windows 11 Enterprise and the Microsoft 365 apps installed.

### Azure Compute Gallery

Azure Compute Gallery enables you to store and manage a collection of custom images. You can build an image to your dev team's exact requirements and store it in a gallery.

To use the custom image while creating a dev box definition, attach the gallery to your dev center. To learn how to attach a gallery, see [Configure Azure Compute Gallery](how-to-configure-azure-compute-gallery.md).

## Image versions

When you select an image to use in your dev box definition, you must specify whether you'll use updated versions of the image:

- **Numbered image versions**: If you want a consistent dev box definition in which the base image doesn't change, use a specific, numbered version of the image. Using a numbered version ensures that all the dev boxes in the pool always use the same version of the image.
- **Latest image versions**: If you want a flexible dev box definition in which you can update the base image as needs change, use the latest version of the image. This choice ensures that new dev boxes use the most recent version of the image. Existing dev boxes aren't modified when an image version is updated.

## Create a dev box definition

You can create multiple dev box definitions to meet the needs of your developer teams.

The following steps show you how to create a dev box definition by using an existing dev center. If you don't have an available dev center, follow the steps in [Quickstart: Configure Microsoft Dev Box](./quickstart-configure-dev-box-service.md) to create one.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **dev center**. In the list of results, select **Dev centers**.

1. Open the dev center in which you want to create the dev box definition, and then select **Dev box definitions**.
  
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/select-dev-box-definitions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the dev center overview page and the menu item for dev box definitions.":::

1. On the **Dev box definitions** page, select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/create-dev-box-definition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create button and the list of existing dev box definitions.":::

1. On the **Create dev box definition** pane, enter the following values:

   |Name|Value|
   |----|----|
   |**Name**|Enter a descriptive name for your dev box definition. You can't change the dev box definition name after it's created. |
   |**Image**|Select the base operating system for the dev box. You can select an image from Azure Marketplace or from Azure Compute Gallery. </br> If you're creating a dev box definition for testing purposes, consider using the **Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise on Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 22H2** or **Visual Studio 2022 Pro on Windows 11 Enterprise + Microsoft 365 Apps 22H2** image.|
   |**Image version**|Select a specific, numbered version to ensure that all the dev boxes in the pool always use the same version of the image. Select **Latest** to ensure that new dev boxes use the latest image available.|
   |**Compute**|Select the compute combination for your dev box definition.|
   |**Storage**|Select the amount of storage for your dev box definition.|

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/recommended-test-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the pane for creating a dev box definition.":::

1. Select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> Dev box definitions with 4 core SKUs are no longer supported. You will need to update to an 8 core SKU or delete the dev box definition.

## Update a dev box definition

Over time, your needs for dev boxes will change. You might want to move from a Windows 10 base operating system to a Windows 11 base operating system, or increase the default compute specification for your dev boxes. Your initial dev box definitions might no longer be appropriate for your needs. You can update a dev box definition so that new dev boxes will use the new configuration.

You can update the image, image version, compute, and storage settings for a dev box definition:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **dev center**. In the list of results, select **Dev centers**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/discover-devcenter.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a search for dev centers in the Azure portal search box.":::

1. Open the dev center that contains the dev box definition that you want to update, and then select **Dev box definitions**.
  
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/select-dev-box-definitions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the dev center overview page and the menu option for dev box definitions.":::
  
1. Select the dev box definitions that you want to update, and then select the edit button.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/update-dev-box-definition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of existing dev box definitions and the edit button.":::

1. On the page for editing a dev box definition, you can select a new image, change the image version, change the compute, or modify the available storage.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/update-dev-box-definition-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the page for editing a dev box definition.":::

1. Select **Save**.

## Delete a dev box definition

You can delete a dev box definition when you no longer want to use it. Deleting a dev box definition is permanent and can't be undone. Dev box definitions can't be deleted if one or more dev box pools are using them.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **dev center**. In the list of results, select **Dev centers**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/discover-devcenter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a search for dev centers from the Azure portal search box.":::

1. Open the dev center from which you want to delete the dev box definition, and then select **Dev box definitions**.
  
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/select-dev-box-definitions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dev center overview page and the menu item for dev box definitions.":::
  
1. Select the dev box definition that you want to delete, and then select **Delete**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-manage-dev-box-definitions/delete-dev-box-definition.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a selected dev box definition and the Delete button.":::

1. In the warning message, select **OK**.
