# Quickstart: Configure Microsoft Dev Box 

This quickstart describes how to set up Microsoft Dev Box to enable development teams to self-serve their dev boxes. The setup process involves two distinct phases. In the first phase, platform engineers configure the necessary Microsoft Dev Box resources through the Azure portal. After this phase is complete, users can proceed to the next phase, creating and managing their dev boxes through the developer portal. This quickstart shows you how to complete the first phase.

The following graphic shows the steps required to configure Microsoft Dev Box in the Azure portal. 

:::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service/dev-box-build-stages.png" alt-text="Graphic showing the stages required to configure Microsoft Dev Box.":::

First, you create a dev center to organize your dev box resources. Next, you configure network components to enable dev boxes to connect to your organizational resources. Then, you create a dev box definition that is used to create dev boxes. After that, you create a project and a dev box pool. Users who have access to a project can create dev boxes from the pools associated with that project.

After you complete this quickstart, you'll have Microsoft Dev Box set up ready for users to create and connect to dev boxes. 

If you already have a Microsoft Dev Box configured and you want to learn how to create and connect to dev boxes, refer to: [Quickstart: Create a dev box by using the developer portal](quickstart-create-dev-box.md).

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- Owner or Contributor role on an Azure subscription or resource group.
- User licenses. To use Dev Box , each user must be licensed for Windows 11 Enterprise or Windows 10 Enterprise, Microsoft Intune, and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) P1. These licenses are available independently and are included in the following subscriptions:
  - Microsoft 365 F3
  - Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5
  - Microsoft 365 A3, Microsoft 365 A5
  - Microsoft 365 Business Premium
  - Microsoft 365 Education Student Use Benefit
- If your organization routes egress traffic through a firewall, open the appropriate ports. For more information, see [Network requirements](/windows-365/enterprise/requirements-network).

## 6. Provide access to a dev box project

Before users can create dev boxes based on the dev box pools in a project, you must provide access for them through a role assignment. The Dev Box User role enables dev box users to create, manage, and delete their own dev boxes. You must have sufficient permissions to a project before you can add users to it.

To assign roles:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box, enter **projects**. In the list of results, select **Projects**.

1. Select the project that you want to give team members access to.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service/select-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of existing projects.":::

1. On the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-configure-dev-box-service/project-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the page for project access control.":::

1. On the command bar, select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

   | Setting | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Role** | Select **DevCenter Dev Box User**. |
   | **Assign access to** | Select **User, group, or service principal**. |
   | **Members** | Select the users or groups that you want to be able to access to the project. |

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-dev-box-user/add-role-assignment-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the pane for adding a role assignment.":::

   The user can now view the project and all the pools within it. The user can create dev boxes from any of the pools and manage those dev boxes from the [developer portal](https://aka.ms/devbox-portal).

## Project Admins

Microsoft Dev Box  makes it possible for you to delegate administration of projects to a member of the project team. Project administrators can assist with the day-to-day management of projects for their teams, like creating and managing dev box pools. To give users permissions to manage projects, assign the DevCenter Project Admin role to them.

You can assign the DevCenter Project Admin role by using the steps described earlier in [6. Provide access to a dev box project](#6-provide-access-to-a-dev-box-project) and select the Project Admin role instead of the Dev Box User role. For more information, see [Provide access to projects for project admins](how-to-project-admin.md).
