# Protect your APIs with Defender for APIs (Preview)

Defender for APIs in Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers full lifecycle protection, detection, and response coverage for APIs.

Defender for APIs helps you to gain visibility into business-critical APIs. You can investigate and improve your API security posture, prioritize vulnerability fixes, and quickly detect active real-time threats.

Learn more about the [Microsoft Defender for APIs](defender-for-apis-introduction.md) plan in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Defender for APIs is currently in preview.

## Prerequisites

- You need a Microsoft Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [sign up for a free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

- You must [enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud](get-started.md#enable-defender-for-cloud-on-your-azure-subscription) on your Azure subscription.

- Review [Defender for APIs support, permissions, and requirements](defender-for-apis-introduction.md) before you begin deployment.

- You enable Defender for APIs at the subscription level.

- Ensure that APIs you want to secure are published in [Azure API management](/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts). Follow [these instructions](/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance) to set up Azure API Management.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to enable and onboard the Defender for APIs plan in the Defender for Cloud portal. Alternately, you can [enable Defender for APIs within an API Management instance](../api-management/protect-with-defender-for-apis.md) in the Azure portal.

## Enable the Defender for APIs plan

1. Sign into the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and in Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings**.

1. Select the subscription that contains the managed APIs that you want to protect.

1. In the **APIs** plan, select **On**. Then select **Save**.

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> After enabling Defender for APIs, onboarded APIs take up to 50 minutes to appear in the **Recommendations** tab. Security insights are available in the **Workload protections** > **API security** dashboard within 40 minutes of onboarding.

## Onboard APIs

1. In the Defender for Cloud portal, select **Recommendations**.
1. Search for *Defender for APIs*.
1. Under **Enable enhanced security features**, select the security recommendation **Azure API Management APIs should be onboarded to Defender for APIs**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/defender-for-apis-deploy/api-recommendations.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to turn on the Defender for APIs plan from the recommendation." lightbox="media/defender-for-apis-deploy/api-recommendations.png":::


1. In the recommendation page, you can review the recommendation severity, update interval, description, and remediation steps.
1. Review the resources in scope for the recommendations:
    - **Unhealthy resources**: Resources that aren't onboarded to Defender for APIs.
    - **Healthy resources**: API resources that are onboarded to Defender for APIs.
    - **Not applicable resources**: API resources that aren't applicable for protection.

1. In **Unhealthy resources**, select the APIs that you want to protect with Defender for APIs.
1. Select **Fix**.

## Track onboarded API resources

After onboarding the API resources, you can track their status in the Defender for Cloud portal > **Workload protections** > **API security**.
