# Automatically configure vulnerability assessment for your machines

Defender for Cloud collects data from your machines using agents and extensions. To save you the process of manually installing the extensions, such as [the manual installation of the Log Analytics agent](working-with-log-analytics-agent.md#manual-agent-provisioning), Defender for Cloud reduces management overhead by installing all required extensions on existing and new machines. Learn more about [monitoring components](monitoring-components.md).

To assess your machines for vulnerabilities, you can use one of the following solutions:

- Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management solution (included with Microsoft Defender for Servers)
- Built-in Qualys agent (included with Microsoft Defender for Servers)
- A Qualys or Rapid7 scanner that you've licensed separately and configured within Defender for Cloud (this scenario is called the Bring Your Own License, or BYOL, scenario)

> [!NOTE]
> To automatically configure a BYOL solution, see [Integrate security solutions in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](partner-integration.md).

## Automatically enable a vulnerability assessment solution

    > [!TIP]
    > If you select the "Microsoft Defender for Cloud built-in Qualys solution" solution, Defender for Cloud enables the following policy: [Configure machines to receive a vulnerability assessment provider](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f13ce0167-8ca6-4048-8e6b-f996402e3c1b).

1. Select **Apply** and then select **Save**.

1. To view the findings for **all** supported vulnerability assessment solutions, see the **Machines should have vulnerability findings resolved** recommendation.
