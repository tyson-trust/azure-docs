### Extended properties in Defender for Cloud security alerts are masked from activity logs

August 17, 2023

We recently changed the way security alerts and activity logs are integrated. To better protect sensitive customer information, we no longer include this information in activity logs. Instead, we mask it with asterisks. However, this information is still available through the alerts API, continuous export, and the Defender for Cloud portal.

Customers who rely on activity logs to export alerts to their SIEM solutions should consider using a different solution, as it isn't the recommended method for exporting Defender for Cloud security alerts.

For instructions on how to export Defender for Cloud security alerts to SIEM, SOAR and other third party applications, see [Stream alerts to a SIEM, SOAR, or IT Service Management solution](export-to-siem.md).

### Preview release of GCP support in Defender CSPM

August 15, 2023

We're announcing the preview release of the Defender CSPM contextual cloud security graph and attack path analysis with support for GCP resources. You can leverage the power of Defender CSPM for comprehensive visibility and intelligent cloud security across GCP resources.

 Key features of our GCP support include:

- **Attack path analysis** - Understand the potential routes attackers might take.
- **Cloud security explorer** - Proactively identify security risks by running graph-based queries on the security graph.
- **Agentless scanning** - Scan servers and identify secrets and vulnerabilities without installing an agent.
- **Data-aware security posture** - Discover and remediate risks to sensitive data in Google Cloud Storage buckets.

### New security alerts in Defender for Servers Plan 2: Detecting potential attacks abusing Azure virtual machine extensions

August 7, 2023

This new series of alerts focuses on detecting suspicious activities of Azure virtual machine extensions and provides insights into attackers' attempts to compromise and perform malicious activities on your virtual machines.

Microsoft Defender for Servers can now detect suspicious activity of the virtual machine extensions, allowing you to get better coverage of the workloads security.  

Azure virtual machine extensions are small applications that run post-deployment on virtual machines and provide capabilities such as configuration, automation, monitoring, security, and more. While extensions are a powerful tool, they can be used by threat actors for various malicious intents, for example:

- Data collection and monitoring
- Code execution and configuration deployment with high privileges
- Resetting credentials and creating administrative users
- Encrypting disks

Here's a table of the new alerts.

|Alert (alert type)|Description|MITRE tactics|Severity|
|----|----|----|----|
| **Suspicious failure installing GPU extension in your subscription (Preview)**<br>(VM_GPUExtensionSuspiciousFailure) | Suspicious intent of installing a GPU extension on unsupported VMs. This extension should be installed on virtual machines equipped with a graphic processor, and in this case the virtual machines aren't equipped with such.

### Streamlined multicloud account onboarding with enhanced settings

June 26, 2023

Defender for Cloud has improved the onboarding experience to include a new streamlined user interface and instructions in addition to new capabilities that allow you to onboard your AWS and GCP environments while providing access to advanced onboarding features.

For organizations that have adopted Hashicorp Terraform for automation, Defender for Cloud now includes the ability to use Terraform as the deployment method alongside AWS CloudFormation or GCP Cloud Shell. You can now customize the required role names when creating the integration. You can also select between:

- **Default access** - Allows Defender for Cloud to scan your resources and automatically include future capabilities.

- **Least privileged access** -Grants Defender for Cloud access only to the current permissions needed for the selected plans.

If you select the least privileged permissions, you'll only receive notifications on any new roles and permissions that are required to get full functionality on the connector health.

Defender for Cloud allows you to distinguish between your cloud accounts by their native names from the cloud vendors. For example, AWS account aliases and GCP project names.

### Private Endpoint support for Malware Scanning in Defender for Storage

June 25, 2023

Private Endpoint support is now available as part of the Malware Scanning public preview in Defender for Storage. This capability allows enabling Malware Scanning on storage accounts that are using private endpoints. No other configuration is needed.

[Malware Scanning (Preview)](defender-for-storage-malware-scan.md) in Defender for Storage helps protect your storage accounts from malicious content by performing a full malware scan on uploaded content in near real-time, using Microsoft Defender Antivirus capabilities. It's designed to help fulfill security and compliance requirements for handling untrusted content. It's an agentless SaaS solution that allows simple setup at scale, with zero maintenance, and supports automating response at scale.

Private endpoints provide secure connectivity to your Azure Storage services, effectively eliminating public internet exposure, and are considered a security best practice.

For storage accounts with private endpoints that have Malware Scanning already enabled, you'll need to disable and [enable the plan with Malware Scanning](/azure/storage/common/azure-defender-storage-configure?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdefender-for-cloud%2Ftoc.json&tabs=enable-subscription) for this to work.

Learn more about using [private endpoints](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) in [Defender for Storage](defender-for-storage-introduction.md) and how to secure your storage services further.

### Recommendation released for preview: Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)

June 21, 2023

 A new container recommendation in Defender CSPM powered by MDVM is released for preview:

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--|
| Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)(Preview) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. This recommendation provides visibility to vulnerable images currently running in your Kubernetes clusters. Remediating vulnerabilities in container images that are currently running is key to improving your security posture, significantly reducing the attack surface for your containerized workloads. | c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5

This new recommendation replaces the current recommendation of the same name, powered by Qualys, only in Defender CSPM (replacing assessment key 41503391-efa5-47ee-9282-4eff6131462c).

### Control updates were made to the NIST 800-53 standards in regulatory compliance

June 15, 2023

The NIST 800-53 standards (both R4 and R5) have recently been updated with control changes in Microsoft Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance. The Microsoft-managed controls have been removed from the standard, and the information on the Microsoft responsibility implementation (as part of the cloud shared responsibility model) is now available only in the control details pane under **Microsoft Actions**.

These controls were previously calculated as passed controls, so you may see a significant dip in your compliance score for NIST standards between April 2023 and May 2023.

For more information on compliance controls, see [Tutorial: Regulatory compliance checks - Microsoft Defender for Cloud](regulatory-compliance-dashboard.md#investigate-regulatory-compliance-issues).

### Planning of cloud migration with an Azure Migrate business case now includes Defender for Cloud

### Express configuration for vulnerability assessments in Defender for SQL is now Generally Available

June 7, 2023

Express configuration for vulnerability assessments in Defender for SQL is now Generally Available. Express configuration provides a streamlined onboarding experience for SQL vulnerability assessments by using a one-click configuration (or an API call). There's no extra settings or dependencies on managed storage accounts needed.

Check out this [blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/defender-for-sql-vulnerability-assessment-updates/ba-p/3837732) to learn more about express configuration.

You can learn the differences between [express and classic configuration](sql-azure-vulnerability-assessment-overview.md#what-are-the-express-and-classic-configurations).

### More scopes added to existing Azure DevOps Connectors

June 6, 2023

Defender for DevOps added the following extra scopes to the Azure DevOps (ADO) application:

- **Advance Security management**: `vso.advsec_manage`. Which is needed in order to allow you to enable, disable and manage GitHub Advanced Security for ADO.

- **Container Mapping**: `vso.extension_manage`, `vso.gallery_manager`; Which is needed in order to allow you to share the decorator extension with the ADO organization.  

Only new Defender for DevOps customers that are trying to onboard ADO resources to Microsoft Defender for Cloud are affected by this change.

### Onboarding directly (without Azure Arc) to Defender for Servers is now Generally Available

June 5, 2023

Previously, Azure Arc was required to onboard non-Azure servers to Defender for Servers. However, with the latest release you can also onboard your on-premises servers to Defender for Servers using only the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint agent.

This new method simplifies the onboarding process for customers focused on core endpoint protection and allows you to take advantage of Defender for Servers’ consumption-based billing for both cloud and noncloud assets. The direct onboarding option via Defender for Endpoint is available now, with billing for onboarded machines starting on July 1.

For more information, see [Connect your non-Azure machines to Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Defender for Endpoint](onboard-machines-with-defender-for-endpoint.md).

### Replacing agent-based discovery with agentless discovery for containers capabilities in Defender CSPM

June 4, 2023

With Agentless Container Posture capabilities available in Defender CSPM, the agent-based discovery capabilities are now retired. If you currently use container capabilities within Defender CSPM, please make sure that the [relevant extensions](how-to-enable-agentless-containers.md) are enabled to continue receiving container-related value of the new agentless capabilities such as container-related attack paths, insights, and inventory. (It can take up to 24 hours to see the effects of enabling the extensions).

We recommend further investigations. | Credential Access | Medium |

For all of the available alerts, see [Alerts for Azure Key Vault](alerts-reference.md#alerts-azurekv).

### Agentless scanning now supports encrypted disks in AWS

Agentless scanning for VMs now supports processing of instances with encrypted disks in AWS, using both CMK and PMK.

This extended support increases coverage and visibility over your cloud estate without impacting your running workloads. Support for encrypted disks maintains the same zero impact method on running instances.

- For new customers enabling agentless scanning in AWS - encrypted disks coverage is built in and supported by default.
- For existing customers that already have an AWS connector with agentless scanning enabled, you need to reapply the CloudFormation stack to your onboarded AWS accounts to update and add the new permissions that are required to process encrypted disks. The updated CloudFormation template includes new assignments that allow Defender for Cloud to process encrypted disks.

You can learn more about the [permissions used to scan AWS instances](faq-permissions.yml).

**To re-apply your CloudFormation stack**:

1. Go to Defender for Cloud environment settings and open your AWS connector.
1. Navigate to the **Configure Access** tab.
1. Select **Click to download the CloudFormation template**.
1. Navigate to your AWS environment and apply the updated template.

### Deprecation of legacy standards in compliance dashboard

Legacy PCI DSS v3.2.1 and legacy SOC TSP have been fully deprecated in the Defender for Cloud compliance dashboard, and replaced by [SOC 2  Type 2](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-soc-2) initiative and [PCI DSS v4](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss) initiative-based compliance standards.
We have fully deprecated support of [PCI DSS](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-pci-dss) standard/initiative in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet.

Learn how to [customize the set of standards in your regulatory compliance dashboard](update-regulatory-compliance-packages.md).

### Two Defender for DevOps recommendations now include Azure DevOps scan findings

Defender for DevOps Code and IaC has expanded its recommendation coverage in Microsoft Defender for Cloud to include Azure DevOps security findings for the following two recommendations:

- `Code repositories should have code scanning findings resolved`

- `Code repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved`

Previously, coverage for Azure DevOps security scanning only included the secrets recommendation.

Learn more about [Defender for DevOps](defender-for-devops-introduction.md).

### New default setting for Defender for Servers vulnerability assessment solution

Vulnerability assessment (VA) solutions are essential to safeguard machines from cyberattacks and data breaches.

Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) is now enabled as the default, built-in solution for all subscriptions protected by Defender for Servers that don't already have a VA solution selected.

If a subscription has a VA solution enabled on any of its VMs, no changes are made and MDVM won't be enabled by default on the remaining VMs in that subscription. You can choose to [enable a VA solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md) on the remaining VMs on your subscriptions.

Learn how to [Find vulnerabilities and collect software inventory with agentless scanning (Preview)](enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless.md).

### Download a CSV report of your cloud security explorer query results (Preview)

Defender for Cloud has added the ability to download a CSV report of your cloud security explorer query results.

After your run a search for a query, you can select the **Download CSV report (Preview)** button from the Cloud Security Explorer page in Defender for Cloud.

### Release of containers Vulnerability Assessment powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) in Defender CSPM

We're announcing the release of Vulnerability Assessment for Linux images in Azure container registries powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM) in Defender CSPM. This release includes daily scanning of images. Findings used in the Security Explorer and attack paths rely on MDVM Vulnerability Assessment instead of the Qualys scanner.  

The existing recommendation `Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved` is replaced by a new recommendation powered by MDVM:

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--|
| Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)| Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. This recommendation provides visibility to vulnerable images currently running in your Kubernetes clusters. Remediating vulnerabilities in container images that are currently running is key to  improving your security posture, significantly reducing the attack surface for your containerized workloads. |dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648 <br> is replaced by  c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5

Learn more about [Agentless Containers Posture in Defender CSPM](concept-agentless-containers.md).

Learn more about [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management (MDVM)](/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management).

### Renaming container recommendations powered by Qualys

The current container recommendations in Defender for Containers will be renamed as follows:

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--|
| Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Qualys) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. | dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648 |
| Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Qualys) | Container image vulnerability assessment scans container images running on your Kubernetes clusters for security vulnerabilities and exposes detailed findings for each image. Resolving the vulnerabilities can greatly improve your containers' security posture and protect them from attacks. |  41503391-efa5-47ee-9282-4eff6131462c |

### Defender for DevOps GitHub Application update

Microsoft Defender for DevOps is constantly making changes and updates that require Defender for DevOps customers who have onboarded their GitHub environments in Defender for Cloud to provide permissions as part of the application deployed in their GitHub organization. These permissions are necessary to ensure all of the security features of Defender for DevOps operate normally and without issues.

We suggest updating the permissions as soon as possible to ensure continued access to all available features of Defender for DevOps.

Permissions can be granted in two different ways:

- In your organization, select **GitHub Apps**. Locate Your organization, and select **Review request**.

- You'll get an automated email from GitHub Support. In the email, select **Review permission request to accept or reject this change**.

After you have followed either of these options, you'll be navigated to the review screen where you should review the request. Select **Accept new permissions** to approve the request.

If you require any assistance updating permissions, you can [create an Azure support request](../azure-portal/supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request.md).

You can also learn more about [Defender for DevOps](defender-for-devops-introduction.md).
If a subscription has a VA solution enabled on any of its VMs, no changes are made and MDVM won't be enabled by default on the remaining VMs in that subscription. You can choose to [enable a VA solution](deploy-vulnerability-assessment-defender-vulnerability-management.md) on the remaining VMs on your subscriptions.

Learn how to [Find vulnerabilities and collect software inventory with agentless scanning (Preview)](enable-vulnerability-assessment-agentless.md).

### Defender for DevOps Pull Request annotations in Azure DevOps repositories now includes Infrastructure as Code misconfigurations

Defender for DevOps has expanded its Pull Request (PR) annotation coverage in Azure DevOps to include Infrastructure as Code (IaC) misconfigurations that are detected in Azure Resource Manager and Bicep templates.

Developers can now see annotations for IaC misconfigurations directly in their PRs. Developers can also remediate critical security issues before the infrastructure is provisioned into cloud workloads. To simplify remediation, developers are provided with a severity level, misconfiguration description, and remediation instructions within each annotation.

Previously, coverage for Defender for DevOps PR annotations in Azure DevOps only included secrets.

Learn more about [Defender for DevOps](defender-for-devops-introduction.md) and [Pull Request annotations](enable-pull-request-annotations.md).

### Agentless Container Posture in Defender CSPM (Preview)

The new Agentless Container Posture (Preview) capabilities are available as part of the Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) plan.

Agentless Container Posture allows security teams to identify security risks in containers and Kubernetes realms. An agentless approach allows security teams to gain visibility into their Kubernetes and containers registries across SDLC and runtime, removing friction and footprint from the workloads.

Agentless Container Posture offers container vulnerability assessments that, combined with attack path analysis, enable security teams to prioritize and zoom into specific container vulnerabilities. You can also use cloud security explorer to uncover risks and hunt for container posture insights, such as discovery of applications running vulnerable images or exposed to the internet.

Learn more at [Agentless Container Posture (Preview)](concept-agentless-containers.md).

### Unified Disk Encryption recommendation (preview)

We have introduced a unified disk encryption recommendation in public preview, `Windows virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost` and `Linux virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost`.

These recommendations replace `Virtual machines should encrypt temp disks, caches, and data flows between Compute and Storage resources`, which detected Azure Disk Encryption and the policy `Virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets should have encryption at host enabled`, which detected EncryptionAtHost. ADE and EncryptionAtHost provide comparable encryption at rest coverage, and we recommend enabling one of them on every virtual machine. The new recommendations detect whether either ADE or EncryptionAtHost are enabled and only warn if neither are enabled. We also warn if ADE is enabled on some, but not all disks of a VM (this condition isn't applicable to EncryptionAtHost).

The new recommendations require [Azure Automanage Machine Configuration](https://aka.ms/gcpol).

These recommendations are based on the following policies:

- [(Preview) Windows virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f3dc5edcd-002d-444c-b216-e123bbfa37c0)
- [(Preview) Linux virtual machines should enable Azure Disk Encryption or EncryptionAtHost](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fca88aadc-6e2b-416c-9de2-5a0f01d1693f)

Learn more about [ADE and EncryptionAtHost and how to enable one of them](../virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview.md).

### Changes in the recommendation Machines should be configured securely

The recommendation `Machines should be configured securely` was updated. The update improves the performance and stability of the recommendation and aligns its experience with the generic behavior of Defender for Cloud's recommendations.

As part of this update, the recommendation's ID was changed from `181ac480-f7c4-544b-9865-11b8ffe87f47` to `c476dc48-8110-4139-91af-c8d940896b98`.

No action is required on the customer side, and there's no expected effect on the secure score.

### Deprecation of App Service language monitoring policies

The following App Service language monitoring policies have been deprecated due to their ability to generate false negatives and because they don't provide better security. You should always ensure you're using a language version without any known vulnerabilities.

| Policy name | Policy ID |
|--|--|
| [App Service apps that use Java should use the latest 'Java version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F496223c3-ad65-4ecd-878a-bae78737e9ed) | 496223c3-ad65-4ecd-878a-bae78737e9ed |
| [App Service apps that use Python should use the latest 'Python version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7008174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73) | 7008174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73 |
| [Function apps that use Java should use the latest 'Java version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F9d0b6ea4-93e2-4578-bf2f-6bb17d22b4bc) | 9d0b6ea4-93e2-4578-bf2f-6bb17d22b4bc |
| [Function apps that use Python should use the latest 'Python version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7238174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73) | 7238174a-fd10-4ef0-817e-fc820a951d73 |
| [App Service apps that use PHP should use the latest 'PHP version'](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F7261b898-8a84-4db8-9e04-18527132abb3)| 7261b898-8a84-4db8-9e04-18527132abb3 |

Customers can use alternative built-in policies to monitor any specified language version for their App Services.

These policies are no longer available in Defender for Cloud's built-in recommendations. You can [add them as custom recommendations](create-custom-recommendations.md) to have Defender for Cloud monitor them.

### New alert in Defender for Resource Manager

Defender for Resource Manager has the following new alert:

| Alert (alert type) | Description | MITRE tactics | Severity |
|---|---|:-:|---|
| **PREVIEW - Suspicious creation of compute resources detected**<br>(ARM_SuspiciousComputeCreation) | Microsoft Defender for Resource Manager identified a suspicious creation of compute resources in your subscription utilizing Virtual Machines/Azure Scale Set. The identified operations are designed to allow administrators to efficiently manage their environments by deploying new resources when needed. While this activity may be legitimate, a threat actor might utilize such operations to conduct crypto mining.<br> The activity is deemed suspicious as the compute resources scale is higher than previously observed in the subscription. <br> This can indicate that the principal is compromised and is being used with malicious intent. | Impact | Medium  |

You can see a list of all of the [alerts available for Resource Manager](alerts-reference.md#alerts-resourcemanager).

### Three alerts in the Defender for Resource Manager plan have been deprecated

The following three alerts for the Defender for Resource Manager plan have been deprecated:

- `Activity from a risky IP address (ARM.MCAS_ActivityFromAnonymousIPAddresses)`
- `Activity from infrequent country (ARM.MCAS_ActivityFromInfrequentCountry)`
- `Impossible travel activity (ARM.MCAS_ImpossibleTravelActivity)`

In a scenario where activity from a suspicious IP address is detected, one of the following Defenders for Resource Manager plan alerts `Azure Resource Manager operation from suspicious IP address` or `Azure Resource Manager operation from suspicious proxy IP address` will be present.

### Alerts automatic export to Log Analytics workspace have been deprecated

Defenders for Cloud security alerts are automatically exported to a default Log Analytics workspace on the resource level. This causes an indeterministic behavior and therefore we have deprecated this feature.

Instead, you can export your security alerts to a dedicated Log Analytics workspace with [Continuous Export](continuous-export.md#set-up-a-continuous-export).

If you have already configured continuous export of your alerts to a Log Analytics workspace, no further action is required.

### Deprecation and improvement of selected alerts for Windows and Linux Servers

The security alert quality improvement process for Defender for Servers includes the deprecation of some alerts for both Windows and Linux servers. The deprecated alerts are now sourced from and covered by Defender for Endpoint threat alerts.  

If you already have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled, no further action is required. You may experience a decrease in your alerts volume in April 2023.

If you don't have the Defender for Endpoint integration enabled in Defender for Servers, you'll need to enable the Defender for Endpoint integration to maintain and improve your alert coverage.

All Defender for Servers customers, have full access to the Defender for Endpoint’s integration as a part of the [Defender for Servers plan](plan-defender-for-servers-select-plan.md#plan-features).  

You can learn more about [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint onboarding options](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md#enable-the-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-integration).

You can also view the [full list of alerts](alerts-reference.md#deprecated-defender-for-servers-alerts) that are set to be deprecated.

### New Azure Active Directory authentication-related recommendations for Azure Data Services

We have added four new Azure Active Directory authentication-related recommendations for Azure Data Services.

| Recommendation Name | Recommendation Description | Policy |
|--|--|--|
| Azure SQL Managed Instance authentication mode should be Azure Active Directory Only | Disabling local authentication methods and allowing only Azure Active Directory Authentication improves security by ensuring that Azure SQL Managed Instances can exclusively be accessed by Azure Active Directory identities. | [Azure SQL Managed Instance should have Azure Active Directory Only Authentication enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2f78215662-041e-49ed-a9dd-5385911b3a1f) |
| Azure Synapse Workspace authentication mode should be Azure Active Directory Only | Azure Active Directory only authentication methods improves security by ensuring that Synapse Workspaces exclusively require Azure AD identities for authentication.

| Azure Database for PostgreSQL should have an Azure Active Directory administrator provisioned | Provision an Azure AD administrator for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL to enable Azure AD authentication. Azure AD authentication enables simplified permission management and centralized identity management of database users and other Microsoft services | [An Azure Active Directory administrator should be provisioned for PostgreSQL servers](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2fproviders%2fMicrosoft.Authorization%2fpolicyDefinitions%2fb4dec045-250a-48c2-b5cc-e0c4eec8b5b4) |

### Two recommendations related to missing Operating System (OS) updates were released to GA

The recommendations `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Update management center)` and `Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates` have been released for General Availability.

To use the new recommendation, you need to:

- Connect your non-Azure machines to Arc.
- [Enable the periodic assessment property](../update-center/assessment-options.md#periodic-assessment). You can use the [Fix button](implement-security-recommendations.md).
 in the new recommendation, `Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates` to fix the recommendation.

### A new Defender for Storage plan is available, including near-real time malware scanning and sensitive data threat detection

Cloud storage plays a key role in the organization and stores large volumes of valuable and sensitive data. Today we're announcing a new Defender for Storage plan. If you’re using the previous plan (now renamed to "Defender for Storage (classic)"), you'll need to proactively [migrate to the new plan](defender-for-storage-classic-migrate.md) in order to use the new features and benefits.

The new plan includes advanced security capabilities to help protect against malicious file uploads, sensitive data exfiltration, and data corruption. It also provides a more predictable and flexible pricing structure for better control over coverage and costs.

The new plan has new capabilities now in public preview:

- Detecting sensitive data exposure and exfiltration events

- Near real-time blob on-upload malware scanning across all file types

- Detecting entities with no identities using SAS tokens

These capabilities enhance the existing Activity Monitoring capability, based on control and data plane log analysis and behavioral modeling to identify early signs of breach.

All these capabilities are available in a new predictable and flexible pricing plan that provides granular control over data protection at both the subscription and resource levels.

Learn more at [Overview of Microsoft Defender for Storage](defender-for-storage-introduction.md).

### Data-aware security posture (preview)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud helps security teams to be more productive at reducing risks and responding to data breaches in the cloud. It allows them to cut through the noise with data context and prioritize the most critical security risks, preventing a costly data breach.

- Automatically discover data resources across cloud estate and evaluate their accessibility, data sensitivity and configured data flows.
-Continuously uncover risks to data breaches of sensitive data resources, exposure or attack paths that could lead to a data resource using a lateral movement technique.
- Detect suspicious activities that may indicate an ongoing threat to sensitive data resources.

[Learn more](concept-data-security-posture.md) about data-aware security posture.

### Improved experience for managing the default Azure security policies

We introduce an improved Azure security policy management experience for built-in recommendations that simplifies the way Defender for Cloud customers fine tune their security requirements. The new experience includes the following new capabilities:

- A simple interface allows better performance and fewer select when managing default security policies within Defender for Cloud, including enabling/disabling, denying, setting parameters and managing exemptions.
- A single view of all built-in security recommendations offered by the Microsoft cloud security benchmark (formerly the Azure security benchmark). Recommendations are organized into logical groups, making it easier to understand the types of resources covered, and the relationship between parameters and recommendations.
- New features such as filters and search have been added.

Learn how to  [manage security policies](tutorial-security-policy.md).

Read the [Microsoft Defender for Cloud blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/improved-experience-for-managing-the-default-azure-security/ba-p/3776522).

### Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) is now Generally Available (GA)

We're announcing that Defender CSPM is now Generally Available (GA). Defender CSPM offers all of the services available under the Foundational CSPM capabilities and adds the following benefits:

- **Attack path analysis and ARG API** - Attack path analysis uses a graph-based algorithm that scans the cloud security graph to expose attack paths and suggests recommendations as to how best remediate issues that break the attack path and prevent successful breach. You can also consume attack paths programmatically by querying Azure Resource Graph (ARG) API. Learn how to use [attack path analysis](how-to-manage-attack-path.md)
- **Cloud Security explorer** - Use the Cloud Security Explorer to run graph-based queries on the cloud security graph, to proactively identify security risks in your multicloud environments.  Learn more about [cloud security explorer](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-explorer).

Learn more about [Defender CSPM](overview-page.md).

### Option to create custom recommendations and security standards in Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides the option of creating custom recommendations and standards for AWS and GCP using KQL queries. You can use a query editor to build and test queries over your data.
This feature is part of the Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) plan. Learn how to [create custom recommendations and standards](create-custom-recommendations.md).

### Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) version 1.0 is now Generally Available (GA)

Microsoft Defender for Cloud is announcing that the Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) version 1.0 is now Generally Available (GA).

MCSB version 1.0 replaces the Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) version 3 as Microsoft Defender for Cloud's default security policy for identifying security vulnerabilities in your cloud environments according to common security frameworks and best practices. MCSB version 1.0 appears as the default compliance standard in the compliance dashboard and is enabled by default for all Defender for Cloud customers.

### New version of the recommendation to find missing system updates (Preview)

You no longer need an agent on your Azure VMs and Azure Arc machines to make sure the machines have all of the latest security or critical system updates.

The new system updates recommendation, `System updates should be installed on your machines (powered by Update management center)` in the `Apply system updates` control, is based on the [Update management center (preview)](../update-center/overview.md). The recommendation relies on a native agent embedded in every Azure VM and Azure Arc machines instead of an installed agent. The Quick Fix in the new recommendation leads you to a one-time installation of the missing updates in the Update management center portal.

To use the new recommendation, you need to:

- Connect your non-Azure machines to Arc
- Turn on the [periodic assessment property](../update-center/assessment-options.md#periodic-assessment). You can use the Quick Fix in the new recommendation, `Machines should be configured to periodically check for missing system updates` to fix the recommendation.

The existing "System updates should be installed on your machines" recommendation, which relies on the Log Analytics agent, is still available under the same control.

### Cleanup of deleted Azure Arc machines in connected AWS and GCP accounts

A machine connected to an AWS and GCP account that is covered by Defender for Servers or Defender for SQL on machines is represented in Defender for Cloud as an Azure Arc machine. Until now, that machine wasn't deleted from the inventory when the machine was deleted from the AWS or GCP account. Leading to unnecessary Azure Arc resources left in Defender for Cloud that represents deleted machines.

Defender for Cloud will now automatically delete Azure Arc machines when those machines are deleted in connected AWS or GCP account.

### Allow continuous export to Event Hubs behind a firewall

You can now enable the continuous export of alerts and recommendations, as a trusted service to Event Hubs that are protected by an Azure firewall.

You can enable continuous export as the alerts or recommendations are generated. You can also define a schedule to send periodic snapshots of all of the new data.

Learn how to enable [continuous export to an Event Hubs behind an Azure firewall](continuous-export.md#continuously-export-to-an-event-hub-behind-a-firewall).
