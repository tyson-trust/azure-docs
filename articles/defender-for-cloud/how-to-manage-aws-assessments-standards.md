# Manage AWS assessments and standards

Security standards contain comprehensive sets of security recommendations to help secure your cloud environments.â€¯Security teams can use the readily available standards such as AWS CIS 1.2.0, AWS CIS 1.5.0, AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, and AWS PCI DSS 3.2.1.

There are two types of resources that are needed to create and manage assessments:

- Standard: defines a set of assessments
- Standard assignment: defines the scope, which the standard evaluates. For example, specific AWS account(s).
