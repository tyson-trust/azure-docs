# What is an external attack surface?

An external attack surface is the entire area of an organization or system that is susceptible to an attack from an external source. An organization's attack surface is made up of all the points of access that an unauthorized person could use to enter their system. The larger your attack surface is, the harder it's to protect.

You can use Defender for Cloud's new integration with Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM), to improve your organization's security posture and reduce the potential risk of being attacked. Defender EASM continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure. This visibility enables security and IT teams to identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall.

Defender EASM applies Microsoft’s crawling technology to discover assets that are related to your known online infrastructure, and actively scans these assets to discover new connections over time. Attack Surface Insights are generated by applying vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase the key areas of concern for your organization, such as: 

- Discover digital assets, always-on inventory  
- Analyze and prioritize risks and threats 
- Pinpoint attacker-exposed weaknesses, anywhere and on-demand 
- Gain visibility into third-party attack surfaces

EASM collects data for publicly exposed assets (“outside-in”). That data can be used by Defender for Cloud CSPM (“inside-out”) to assist with internet-exposure validation and discovery capabilities to provide better visibility to customers.
