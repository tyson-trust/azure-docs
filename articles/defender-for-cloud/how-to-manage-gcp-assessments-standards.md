# Manage GCP assessments and standards

Security standards contain comprehensive sets of security recommendations to help secure your cloud environments.â€¯Security teams can use the readily available regulatory standards such as GCP CIS 1.1.0, GCP CIS and 1.2.0, or create custom standards to meet specific internal requirements.

There are two types of resources that are needed to create and manage standards:

- Standard: defines a set of assessments
- Standard assignment: defines the scope, which the standard evaluates. For example, specific GCP projects.
