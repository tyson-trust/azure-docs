# Validate your Microsoft Defender for APIs alerts

Microsoft Defender for APIs offers full lifecycle protection, detection, and response coverage for APIs that are published in Azure API Management. One of the main capabilities is the ability to detect exploits of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) API Top 10 vulnerabilities through runtime observations of anomalies using machine learning-based and rule-based detections.

This page will walk you through the steps to trigger an alert for one of your API endpoints through Defender for APIs. In this scenario, the alert will be for the detection of a suspicious user agent.

## Prerequisites

- [Create a new Azure API Management service instance in the Azure portal](../api-management/get-started-create-service-instance.md)

- Check the [support and prerequisites for Defender for APIs deployment](defender-for-apis-prepare.md)

- [Import and publish your first API](../api-management/import-and-publish.md)

- [Onboard Defender for APIs](defender-for-apis-deploy.md)

- An account with [Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup)
