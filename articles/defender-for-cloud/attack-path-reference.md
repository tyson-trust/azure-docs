# Reference list of attack paths and cloud security graph components

This article lists the attack paths, connections, and insights used in Defender Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM).

- You need to [enable Defender CSPM](enable-enhanced-security.md#enable-defender-plans-to-get-the-enhanced-security-features) to view attack paths.
- What you see in your environment depends on the resources you're protecting, and your customized configuration.

Learn more about [the cloud security graph, attack path analysis, and the cloud security explorer](concept-attack-path.md).
