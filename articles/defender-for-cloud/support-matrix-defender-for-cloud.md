## Supported operating systems

Defender for Cloud depends on the [Azure Monitor Agent](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md) or the [Log Analytics agent](../azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent.md). Make sure that your machines are running one of the supported operating systems as described on the following pages:

- Azure Monitor Agent
    - [Azure Monitor Agent for Windows supported operating systems](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md#windows)
    - [Azure Monitor Agent for Linux supported operating systems](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md#linux)
- Log Analytics agent
    - [Log Analytics agent for Windows supported operating systems](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md#windows)
    - [Log Analytics agent for Linux supported operating systems](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md#linux)

Also ensure your Log Analytics agent is [properly configured to send data to Defender for Cloud](working-with-log-analytics-agent.md#manual-agent).

To learn more about the specific Defender for Cloud features available on Windows and Linux, review:

- [Defender for Servers support](support-matrix-defender-for-servers.md)
- [Defender for Containers support](support-matrix-defender-for-containers.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Even though Microsoft Defender for Servers is designed to protect servers, most of its features are supported for Windows 10 machines. One feature that isn't currently supported is [Defender for Cloud's integrated EDR solution: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).
