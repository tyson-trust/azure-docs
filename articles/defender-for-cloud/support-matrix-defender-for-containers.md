### Kubernetes distributions and configurations

| Aspect | Details |
|--|--|
| Kubernetes distributions and configurations | **Supported**<br> • Any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters<br>• [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../aks/intro-kubernetes.md) with [Kubernetes RBAC](../aks/concepts-identity.md#kubernetes-rbac) <br> • [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)<br> • [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Standard](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) <br><br> **Supported via Arc enabled Kubernetes** <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup><br>• [Azure Kubernetes Service hybrid](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-hybrid-options-overview)<br> • [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)<br> • [AKS Engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine)<br> • [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/openshift/)<br> • [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/kubernetes/) (version 4.6 or newer)<br> • [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid)<br> • [Rancher Kubernetes Engine](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/)<br> |

<sup><a name="footnote1"></a>1</sup> Any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters should be supported, but only the specified clusters have been tested.

<sup><a name="footnote2"></a>2</sup> To get [Microsoft Defender for Containers](../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction.md) protection for your environments, you'll need to onboard [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](../azure-arc/kubernetes/overview.md) and enable Defender for Containers as an Arc extension.

> [!NOTE]
> For additional requirements for Kubernetes workload protection, see [existing limitations](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#limitations).

### Private link restrictions

Defender for Containers relies on the [Defender agent](defender-for-cloud-glossary.md#defender-agent) for several features. The Defender agent doesn't support  the ability to ingest data through Private Link. You can disable public access for ingestion, so that only machines that are configured to send traffic through Azure Monitor Private Link can send data to that workstation. You can configure a private link by navigating to **`your workspace`** > **Network Isolation** and setting the Virtual networks access configurations to **No**.

:::image type="content" source="media/supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-cloud-containers/network-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to go to turn off data ingestion.":::

Allowing data ingestion to occur only through Private Link Scope on your workspace Network Isolation settings, can result in communication failures and partial converge of the Defender for Containers feature set.

#### Supported host operating systems

Defender for Containers relies on the **Defender agent** for several features. The Defender agent is supported on the following host operating systems:

- Amazon Linux 2
- CentOS 8
- Debian 10
- Debian 11
- Google Container-Optimized OS
- Mariner 1.0
- Mariner 2.0
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04

Ensure your Kubernetes node is running on one of the verified supported operating systems. Clusters with different host operating systems, will only get partial coverage.
