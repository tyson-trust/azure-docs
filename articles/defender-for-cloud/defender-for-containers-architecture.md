# Defender for Containers architecture

Defender for Containers is designed differently for each Kubernetes environment whether they're running in:

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** - Microsoft's managed service for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications.

- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in a connected Amazon Web Services (AWS) account** - Amazon's managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in a connected Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project** - Google’s managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling applications using GCP infrastructure.

- **An unmanaged Kubernetes distribution** (using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes) - Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) certified Kubernetes clusters hosted on-premises or on IaaS.

> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Containers support for Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters (AWS EKS and GCP GKE) is a preview feature.

To protect your Kubernetes containers, Defender for Containers receives and analyzes:

- Audit logs and security events from the API server
- Cluster configuration information from the control plane
- Workload configuration from Azure Policy
- Security signals and events from the node level

To learn more about implementation details such as supported operating systems, feature availability, outbound proxy, see [Defender for Containers feature availability](supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-containers.md).

When Defender for Cloud protects a cluster hosted in Azure Kubernetes Service, the collection of audit log data is agentless and frictionless. These are the required components:

- **Defender agent**: The DaemonSet that is deployed on each node, collects signals from hosts using [eBPF technology](https://ebpf.io/), and provides runtime protection. The agent is registered with a Log Analytics workspace, and used as a data pipeline. However, the audit log data isn't stored in the Log Analytics workspace. It is deployed under AKS Security profile in AKS clusters and as an Arc extension in Arc enabled Kubernetes clusters. The Defender agent is deployed as an AKS Security profile.

- **Azure Policy for Kubernetes**:  A pod that extends the open-source [Gatekeeper v3](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) and registers as a web hook to Kubernetes admission control making it possible to apply at-scale enforcements, and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. For more information, see [Protect your Kubernetes workloads](kubernetes-workload-protections.md) and [Understand Azure Policy for Kubernetes clusters](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes). The Azure Policy for Kubernetes pod is deployed as an AKS add-on.

## [**On-premises / IaaS (Arc)**](#tab/defender-for-container-arch-arc)

### Architecture diagram of Defender for Cloud and Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

For all clusters hosted outside of Azure, [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](../azure-arc/kubernetes/overview.md) is required to connect the clusters to Azure and provide Azure services such as Defender for Containers.

When a non-Azure container is connected to Azure with Arc, the [Arc extension](../azure-arc/kubernetes/extensions.md) collects Kubernetes audit logs data from all control plane nodes in the cluster. The extension sends the log data to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud backend in the cloud for further analysis. The extension is registered with a Log Analytics workspace used as a data pipeline, but the audit log data isn't stored in the Log Analytics workspace.

Workload configuration information is collected by Azure Policy for Kubernetes. As explained in [this Azure Policy for Kubernetes page](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md), the policy extends the open-source [Gatekeeper v3](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) admission controller webhook for [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/). Kubernetes admission controllers are plugins that enforce how your clusters are used. The add-on registers as a web hook to Kubernetes admission control and makes it possible to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner.

## [**AWS (EKS)**](#tab/defender-for-container-arch-eks)

### Architecture diagram of Defender for Cloud and EKS clusters

These components are required in order to receive the full protection offered by Microsoft Defender for Containers:

- **[Kubernetes audit logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/)** – [AWS account’s CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) enables, and collects audit log data through an agentless collector, and sends the collected information to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud backend for further analysis.

- **[Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](../azure-arc/kubernetes/overview.md)** - An agent based solution that connects your EKS clusters to Azure. Azure then is capable of providing services such as Defender, and Policy as [Arc extensions](../azure-arc/kubernetes/extensions.md).
