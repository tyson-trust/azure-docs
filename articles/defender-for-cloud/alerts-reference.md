# Security alerts - a reference guide

This article lists the security alerts you might get from Microsoft Defender for Cloud and any Microsoft Defender plans you've enabled. The alerts shown in your environment depend on the resources and services you're protecting, and your customized configuration.

At the bottom of this page, there's a table describing the Microsoft Defender for Cloud kill chain aligned with version 9 of the [MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/).

[Learn how to respond to these alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts from different sources might take different amounts of time to appear. For example, alerts that require analysis of network traffic might take longer to appear than alerts related to suspicious processes running on virtual machines.

## <a name="alerts-k8scluster"></a>Alerts for containers - Kubernetes clusters

Microsoft Defender for Containers provides security alerts on the cluster level and on the underlying cluster nodes by monitoring both control plane (API server) and the containerized workload itself. Control plane security alerts can be recognized by a prefix of `K8S_` of the alert type. Security alerts for runtime workload in the clusters can be recognized by the `K8S.NODE_` prefix of the alert type. All alerts are supported on Linux only, unless otherwise indicated.

| Alert (alert type) | Description | MITRE tactics<br>([Learn more](#intentions)) | Severity |
|--|--|:-:|--|
| **Exposed Postgres service with trust authentication configuration in Kubernetes detected (Preview)**<br>(K8S_ExposedPostgresTrustAuth)|Kubernetes cluster configuration analysis detected exposure of a Postgres service by a load balancer. The service is configured with trust authentication method, which doesn't require credentials.|InitialAccess|Medium|
| **Exposed Postgres service with risky configuration in Kubernetes detected (Preview)**<br>(K8S_ExposedPostgresBroadIPRange)|Kubernetes cluster configuration analysis detected exposure of a Postgres service by a load balancer with a risky configuration. Exposing the service to a wide range of IP addresses poses a security risk.|InitialAccess|Medium|
| **Attempt to create a new Linux namespace from a container detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_NamespaceCreation) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container in Kubernetes cluster detected an attempt to create a new Linux namespace. While this behavior might be legitimate, it might indicate that an attacker tries to escape from the container to the node. Some CVE-2022-0185 exploitations use this technique. | PrivilegeEscalation | Medium |
| **A history file has been cleared**<br>(K8S.NODE_HistoryFileCleared) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected that the command history log file has been cleared. Attackers may do this to cover their tracks. The operation was performed by the specified user account. | DefenseEvasion | Medium |
| **Abnormal activity of managed identity associated with Kubernetes (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AbnormalMiActivity) | Analysis of Azure Resource Manager operations detected an abnormal behavior of a managed identity used by an AKS addon. The detected activity isn\'t consistent with the behavior of the associated addon. While this activity can be legitimate, such behavior might indicate that the identity was gained by an attacker, possibly from a compromised container in the Kubernetes cluster. | Lateral Movement | Medium |
| **Abnormal Kubernetes service account operation detected**<br>(K8S_ServiceAccountRareOperation) | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected abnormal behavior by a service account in your Kubernetes cluster. The service account was used for an operation, which isn't common for this service account. While this activity can be legitimate, such behavior might indicate that the service account is being used for malicious purposes. | Lateral Movement, Credential Access | Medium |
| **An uncommon connection attempt detected**<br>(K8S.NODE_SuspectConnection) <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> | Analysis of processes running within a container or directly on a Kubernetes node, has detected an uncommon connection attempt utilizing a socks protocol. This is very rare in normal operations, but a known technique for attackers attempting to bypass network-layer detections. | Execution, Exfiltration, Exploitation | Medium |
| **Anomalous pod deployment (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AnomalousPodDeployment) <sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected pod deployment which is anomalous based on previous pod deployment activity. This activity is considered an anomaly when taking into account how the different features seen in the deployment operation are in relations to one another. The features monitored include the container image registry used, the account performing the deployment, day of the week, how often this account performs pod deployments, user agent used in the operation, whether this is a namespace to which pod deployments often occur, and other features. Top contributing reasons for raising this alert as anomalous activity are detailed under the alert's extended properties. | Execution | Medium |
| **Anomalous secret access (Preview)**<br>(K8S_AnomalousSecretAccess) <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup> | Kubernetes audit log analysis detected secret access request which is anomalous based on previous secret access activity. This activity is considered an anomaly when taking into account how the different features seen in the secret access operation are in relations to one another.

|**Suspicious external access to an Azure storage account with overly permissive SAS token (Preview)**<br>Storage.Blob_AccountSas.InternalSasUsedExternally|  The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address accessed the storage account using an overly permissive SAS token with a long expiration date. This type of access is considered suspicious because the SAS token is typically only used in internal networks (from private IP addresses). <br>The activity may indicate that a SAS token has been leaked by a malicious actor or leaked unintentionally from a legitimate source. <br>Even if the access is legitimate, using a high-permission SAS token with a long expiration date goes against security best practices and poses a potential security risk. <br>Applies to: Azure Blob (Standard general-purpose v2, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or premium block blobs) storage accounts with the new Defender for Storage plan.   |  Exfiltration /  Resource Development / Impact   |  Medium |
|**Suspicious external operation to an Azure storage account with overly permissive SAS token (Preview)**<br>Storage.Blob_AccountSas.UnusualOperationFromExternalIp|  The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address accessed the storage account using an overly permissive SAS token with a long expiration date. The access is considered suspicious because operations invoked outside your network (not from private IP addresses) with this SAS token are typically used for a specific set of Read/Write/Delete operations, but other operations occurred, which makes this access suspicious. <br>This activity may indicate that a SAS token has been leaked by a malicious actor or leaked unintentionally from a legitimate source. <br>Even if the access is legitimate, using a high-permission SAS token with a long expiration date goes against security best practices and poses a potential security risk. <br>Applies to: Azure Blob (Standard general-purpose v2, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or premium block blobs) storage accounts with the new Defender for Storage plan.   |  Exfiltration /  Resource Development / Impact   |  Medium |
|**Unusual SAS token was used to access an Azure storage account from a public IP address (Preview)**<br>Storage.Blob_AccountSas.UnusualExternalAccess|  The alert indicates that someone with an external (public) IP address has accessed the storage account using an account SAS token. The access is highly unusual and considered suspicious, as access to the storage account using SAS tokens typically comes only from internal (private) IP addresses. <br>It's possible that a SAS token was leaked or generated by a malicious actor either from within your organization or externally to gain access to this storage account. <br>Applies to: Azure Blob (Standard general-purpose v2, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 or premium block blobs) storage accounts with the new Defender for Storage plan.   |  Exfiltration /  Resource Development / Impact   |  Low         |

| Alert (alert type)| Description | MITRE tactics<br>([Learn more](#intentions)) | Severity |
|--|--|:-:|--|
| **Access from a Tor exit node** <br> (CosmosDB_TorAnomaly)  | This Azure Cosmos DB account was successfully accessed from an IP address known to be an active exit node of Tor, an anonymizing proxy. Authenticated access from a Tor exit node is a likely indication that a threat actor is trying to hide their identity. | Initial Access | High/Medium |
| **Access from a suspicious IP**<br>(CosmosDB_SuspiciousIp) | This Azure Cosmos DB account was successfully accessed from an IP address that was identified as a threat by Microsoft Threat Intelligence. | Initial Access  | Medium |
| **Access from an unusual location**<br>(CosmosDB_GeoAnomaly) | This Azure Cosmos DB account was accessed from a location considered unfamiliar, based on the usual access pattern. <br><br> Either a threat actor has gained access to the account, or a legitimate user has connected from a new or unusual geographic location | Initial Access | Low |
| **Unusual volume of data extracted**<br>(CosmosDB_DataExfiltrationAnomaly) | An unusually large volume of data has been extracted from this Azure Cosmos DB account. This might indicate that a threat actor exfiltrated data. | Exfiltration | Medium |
| **Extraction of Azure Cosmos DB accounts keys via a potentially malicious script**<br>(CosmosDB_SuspiciousListKeys.MaliciousScript) | A PowerShell script was run in your subscription and performed a suspicious pattern of key-listing operations to get the keys of Azure Cosmos DB accounts in your subscription. Threat actors use automated scripts, like Microburst, to list keys and find Azure Cosmos DB accounts they can access. <br><br> This operation might indicate that an identity in your organization was breached, and that the threat actor is trying to compromise Azure Cosmos DB accounts in your environment for malicious intentions. <br><br> Alternatively, a malicious insider could be trying to access sensitive data and perform lateral movement. | Collection | High |
| **Suspicious extraction of Azure Cosmos DB account keys** (AzureCosmosDB_SuspiciousListKeys.SuspiciousPrincipal) | A suspicious source extracted Azure Cosmos DB account access keys from your subscription. If this source is not a legitimate source, this may be a high impact issue. The access key that was extracted provides full control over the associated databases and the data stored within. See the details of each specific alert to understand why the source was flagged as suspicious. | Credential Access | high |
| **SQL injection: potential data exfiltration**<br>(CosmosDB_SqlInjection.DataExfiltration) | A suspicious SQL statement was used to query a container in this Azure Cosmos DB account. <br><br> The injected statement might have succeeded in exfiltrating data that the threat actor isn't authorized to access. <br><br> Due to the structure and capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB queries, many known SQL injection attacks on Azure Cosmos DB accounts can't work. However, the variation used in this attack may work and threat actors can exfiltrate data. | Exfiltration  | Medium |
| **SQL injection: fuzzing attempt**<br>(CosmosDB_SqlInjection.FailedFuzzingAttempt) | A suspicious SQL statement was used to query a container in this Azure Cosmos DB account. <br><br> Like other well-known SQL injection attacks, this attack won't succeed in compromising the Azure Cosmos DB account. <br><br> Nevertheless, it's an indication that a threat actor is trying to attack the resources in this account, and your application may be compromised. <br><br> Some SQL injection attacks can succeed and be used to exfiltrate data. This means that if the attacker continues performing SQL injection attempts, they may be able to compromise your Azure Cosmos DB account and exfiltrate data. <br><br> You can prevent this threat by using parameterized queries. | Pre-attack  | Low |

## MITRE ATT&CK tactics

Understanding the intention of an attack can help you investigate and report the event more easily. To help with these efforts, Microsoft Defender for Cloud alerts include the MITRE tactics with many alerts.

The series of steps that describe the progression of a cyberattack from reconnaissance to data exfiltration is often referred to as a "kill chain".

Defender for Cloud's supported kill chain intents are based on [version 9 of the MITRE ATT&CK matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v9/) and described in the table below.

| Tactic                   | ATT&CK Version    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PreAttack**            |     | [PreAttack](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/pre/) could be either an attempt to access a certain resource regardless of a malicious intent, or a failed attempt to gain access to a target system to gather information prior to exploitation. This step is usually detected as an attempt, originating from outside the network, to scan the target system and identify an entry point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Initial Access**       | V7, V9    | Initial Access is the stage where an attacker manages to get a foothold on the attacked resource. This stage is relevant for compute hosts and resources such as user accounts, certificates etc. Threat actors will often be able to control the resource after this stage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Persistence**          | V7, V9    | Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat actor a persistent presence on that system. Threat actors will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or provide an alternate backdoor for them to regain access.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Privilege Escalation** | V7, V9    | Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allow an adversary to obtain a higher level of permissions on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems or perform specific functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective may also be considered an escalation of privilege.|
| **Defense Evasion**      | V7, V9    | Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as (or variations of) techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Credential Access**    | V7, V9    | Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.                                                                                                      |
| **Discovery**            | V7, V9    | Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.                                                                                                                                    |
| **LateralMovement**      | V7, V9    | Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The lateral movement techniques could allow an adversary to gather information from a system without needing more tools, such as a remote access tool. An adversary can use lateral movement for many purposes, including remote Execution of tools, pivoting to more systems, access to specific information or files, access to more credentials, or to cause an effect. |
| **Execution**            | V7, V9    | The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of adversary-controlled code on a local or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Collection**           | V7, V9    | Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Command and Control**  | V7, V9    | The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Exfiltration**         | V7, V9    | Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where the adversary may look for information to exfiltrate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Impact**               | V7, V9    | Impact events primarily try to directly reduce the availability or integrity of a system, service, or network; including manipulation of data to impact a business or operational process. This would often refer to techniques such as ransomware, defacement, data manipulation, and others.

## Alerts for Defender for APIs

**Alert (alert type)** | **Description** | **MITRE tactics** | **Severity**
--- | --- | --- | ---
**(Preview) Suspicious population-level spike in API traffic to an API endpoint**<br/> (API_PopulationSpikeInAPITraffic) | A suspicious spike in API traffic was detected at one of the API endpoints. The detection system used historical traffic patterns to establish a baseline for routine API traffic volume between all IPs and the endpoint, with the baseline being specific to API traffic for each status code (such as 200 Success). The detection system flagged an unusual deviation from this baseline leading to the detection of suspicious activity. | Impact | Medium
**(Preview) Suspicious spike in API traffic from a single IP address to an API endpoint**<br/> (API_SpikeInAPITraffic) | A suspicious spike in API traffic was detected from a client IP to the API endpoint. The detection system used historical traffic patterns to establish a baseline for routine API traffic volume to the endpoint coming from a specific IP to the endpoint. The detection system flagged an unusual deviation from this baseline leading to the detection of suspicious activity. | Impact | Medium
**(Preview) Unusually large response payload transmitted between a single IP address and an API endpoint**<br/> (API_SpikeInPayload) | A suspicious spike in API response payload size was observed for traffic between a single IP and one of the API endpoints. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns a baseline that represents the typical API response payload size between a specific IP and API endpoint. The learned baseline is specific to API traffic for each status code (e.g., 200 Success). The alert was triggered because an API response payload size deviated significantly from the historical baseline. | Initial access | Medium
**(Preview) Unusually large request body transmitted between a single IP address and an API endpoint**<br/> (API_SpikeInPayload) | A suspicious spike in API request body size was observed for traffic between a single IP and one of the API endpoints. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns a baseline that represents the typical API request body size between a specific IP and API endpoint. The learned baseline is specific to API traffic for each status code (e.g., 200 Success). The alert was triggered because an API request size deviated significantly from the historical baseline. | Initial access | Medium
**(Preview) Suspicious spike in latency for traffic between a single IP address and an API endpoint**<br/> (API_SpikeInLatency) | A suspicious spike in latency was observed for traffic between a single IP and one of the API endpoints. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns a baseline that represents the routine API traffic latency between a specific IP and API endpoint. The learned baseline is specific to API traffic for each status code (e.g., 200 Success). The alert was triggered because an API call latency deviated significantly from the historical baseline. | Initial access | Medium
**(Preview) API requests spray from a single IP address to an unusually large number of distinct API endpoints**<br/>(API_SprayInRequests) | A single IP was observed making API calls to an unusually large number of distinct endpoints. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defenders for APIs learns a baseline that represents the typical number of distinct endpoints called by a single IP across 20-minute windows. The alert was triggered because a single IP's behavior deviated significantly from the historical baseline. | Discovery | Medium
**(Preview) Parameter enumeration on an API endpoint**<br/> (API_ParameterEnumeration) | A single IP was observed enumerating parameters when accessing one of the API endpoints. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns a baseline that represents the typical number of distinct parameter values used by a single IP when accessing this endpoint across 20-minute windows. The alert was triggered because a single client IP recently accessed an endpoint using an unusually large number of distinct parameter values. | Initial access | Medium
**(Preview) Distributed parameter enumeration on an API endpoint**<br/> (API_DistributedParameterEnumeration) | The aggregate user population (all IPs) was observed enumerating parameters when accessing one of the API endpoints. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns a baseline that represents the typical number of distinct parameter values used by the user population (all IPs) when accessing an endpoint across 20-minute windows. The alert was triggered because the user population recently accessed an endpoint using an unusually large number of distinct parameter values. | Initial access | Medium
**(Preview) Parameter value(s) with anomalous data types in an API call**<br/> (API_UnseenParamType) | A single IP was observed accessing one of your API endpoints and using parameter values of a low probability data type (e.g., string, integer, etc.). Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns the expected data types for each API parameter. The alert was triggered because an IP recently accessed an endpoint using a previously low probability data type as a parameter input. | Impact | Medium
**(Preview) Previously unseen parameter used in an API call**<br/> (API_UnseenParam) | A single IP was observed accessing one of the API endpoints using a previously unseen or out-of-bounds parameter in the request. Based on historical traffic patterns from the last 30 days, Defender for APIs learns a set of expected parameters associated with calls to an endpoint. The alert was triggered because an IP recently accessed an endpoint using a previously unseen parameter. | Impact | Medium
**(Preview) Access from a Tor exit node to an API endpoint**<br/> (API_AccessFromTorExitNode) | An IP address from the Tor network accessed one of your API endpoints. Tor is a network that allows people to access the Internet while keeping their real IP hidden. Though there are legitimate uses, it is frequently used by attackers to hide their identity when they target people's systems online. | Pre-attack | Medium
**(Preview) API Endpoint access from suspicious IP**<br/> (API_AccessFromSuspiciousIP) | An IP address accessing one of your API endpoints was identified by Microsoft Threat Intelligence as having a high probability of being a threat. While observing malicious Internet traffic, this IP came up as involved in attacking other online targets.  | Pre-attack | High
**(Preview) Suspicious User Agent detected**<br/> (API_AccessFromSuspiciousUserAgent) | The user agent of a request accessing one of your API endpoints contained anomalous values indicative of an attempt at remote code execution. This does not mean that any of your API endpoints have been breached, but it does suggest that an attempted attack is underway. | Execution | Medium
