# Manage secrets with agentless secret scanning (preview)

Attackers can move laterally across networks, find sensitive data, and exploit vulnerabilities to damage critical information systems by accessing internet-facing workloads and exploiting exposed credentials and secrets.

Defender for Cloud's agentless secret scanning for Virtual Machines (VM) locates plaintext secrets that exist in your environment. If secrets are detected, Defender for Cloud can assist your security team to prioritize and take actionable remediation steps to minimize the risk of lateral movement, all without affecting your machine's performance.

By using agentless secret scanning, you can proactively discover the following types of secrets across your environments:

- **Insecure SSH private keys (Azure, AWS, GCP)** - supports RSA algorithm for PuTTy files, PKCS#8 and PKCS#1 standards
- **Plaintext Azure SQL connection strings (Azure, AWS)** - supports SQL PAAS
- **Plaintext Azure storage account connection strings (Azure, AWS)**
- **Plaintext Azure storage account SAS tokens (Azure, AWS)**
- **Plaintext AWS access keys (Azure, AWS)**
- **Plaintext AWS RDS SQL connection string (Azure, AWS)** -supports SQL PAAS

In addition to detecting SSH private keys, the agentless scanner verifies whether they can be used to move laterally in the network. Keys that we didn't successfully verify are categorized as **unverified** in the **Recommendation** pane.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

For requirements for agentless scanning, see [Learn about agentless scanning](concept-agentless-data-collection.md#availability).

## Remediate secrets with attack path

Attack path analysis is a graph-based algorithm that scans your [cloud security graph](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-graph). These scans expose exploitable paths that attackers may use to breach your environment to reach your high-impact assets. Attack path analysis exposes attack paths and suggests recommendations as to how best remediate issues that break the attack path and prevent successful breach.

Attack path analysis takes into account the contextual information of your environment to identify issues that may compromise it. This analysis helps prioritize the riskiest issues for faster remediation.

The attack path page shows an overview of your attack paths, affected resources and a list of active attack paths.

### Azure VM supported attack path scenarios

Agentless secret scanning for Azure VMs supports the following attack path scenarios:

- `Exposed Vulnerable VM has an insecure SSH private key that is used to authenticate to a VM`.

- `Exposed Vulnerable VM has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to a storage account`.

- `Vulnerable VM has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to a storage account`.

- `Exposed Vulnerable VM has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to an SQL server`.

### AWS instances supported attack path scenarios

Agentless secret scanning for AWS instances supports the following attack path scenarios:

- `Exposed Vulnerable EC2 instance has an insecure SSH private key that is used to authenticate to a EC2 instance`.

- `Exposed Vulnerable EC2 instance has an insecure secret that are used to authenticate to a storage account`.

- `Exposed Vulnerable EC2 instance has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to an AWS RDS server`.

- `Vulnerable EC2 instance has insecure secrets that are used to authenticate to an AWS RDS server`.

### GCP instances supported attack path scenarios

Agentless secret scanning for GCP VM instances supports the following attack path scenarios:

- `Exposed Vulnerable GCP VM instance has an insecure SSH private key that is used to authenticate to a GCP VM instance`.

**To investigate secrets with Attack path**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations** > **Attack path**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/secret-scanning/attack-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to navigate to your attack path in Defender for Cloud.":::

1. Select the relevant attack path.

1. Follow the remediation steps to remediate the attack path.

## Remediate secrets with recommendations

If a secret is found on your resource, that resource triggers an affiliated recommendation that is located under the Remediate vulnerabilities security control on the recommendations page. Depending on your resources, either or both of the following recommendations appear:

- **Azure resources**: `Machines should have secrets findings resolved`

- **AWS resources**: `EC2 instances should have secret findings resolved`

- **GCP resources**: `VM instances should have secret findings resolved`

**To remediate secrets from the recommendations page**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Recommendations**.

1. Expand the **Remediate vulnerabilities** security control.

1. Select either:

    - **Azure resources**: `Machines should have secrets findings resolved`

    - **AWS resources**: `EC2 instances should have secret findings resolved`
    - **GCP resources**: `VM instances should have secret findings resolved`

        :::image type="content" source="media/secret-scanning/recommendation-findings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows either of the two results under the Remediate vulnerabilities security control." lightbox="media/secret-scanning/recommendation-findings.png":::

1. Expand **Affected resources** to review the list of all resources that contain secrets.

1. In the Findings section, select a secret to view detailed information about the secret.

    :::image type="content" source="media/secret-scanning/select-findings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the detailed information of a secret after you have selected the secret in the findings section." lightbox="media/secret-scanning/select-findings.png":::

1. Expand **Remediation steps** and follow the listed steps.

1. Expand **Affected resources** to review the resources affected by this secret.

1. (Optional) You can select an affected resource to see that resources information.

Secrets that don't have a known attack path, are referred to as `secrets without an identified target resource`.

## Remediate secrets with cloud security explorer

The [cloud security explorer](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-explorer) enables you to proactively identify potential security risks within your cloud environment. It does so by querying the [cloud security graph](concept-attack-path.md#what-is-cloud-security-graph), which is the context engine of Defender for Cloud. The cloud security explorer allows your security team to prioritize any concerns, while also considering the specific context and conventions of your organization.

**To remediate secrets with cloud security explorer**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Cloud Security Explorer**.

1. Select one of the following templates:

    - **VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to another VM** - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access other VMs or EC2s.
    - **VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to a storage account** - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access storage accounts.
    - **VM with plaintext secret that can authenticate to a SQL database** - Returns all Azure VMs, AWS EC2 instances, or GCP VM instances with plaintext secret that can access SQL databases.

If you don't want to use any of the available templates, you can also [build your own query](how-to-manage-cloud-security-explorer.md) on the cloud security explorer.

## Remediate secrets from your asset inventory

Your [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md) shows the [security posture](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) of the resources you've connected to Defender for Cloud. Defender for Cloud periodically analyzes the security state of resources connected to your subscriptions to identify potential security issues and provides you with active recommendations.

The asset inventory allows you to view the secrets discovered on a specific machine.

**To remediate secrets from your asset inventory**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Inventory**.

1. Select the relevant VM.

1. Go to the **Secrets** tab.

1. Review each plaintext secret that appears with the relevant metadata.

1. Select a secret to view extra details of that secret.

Different types of secrets have different sets of additional information. For example, for plaintext SSH private keys, the information includes related public keys (mapping between the private key to the authorized keysâ€™ file we discovered or mapping to a different virtual machine that contains the same SSH private key identifier).
