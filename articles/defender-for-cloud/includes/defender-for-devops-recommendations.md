## DevOps recommendations

| Recommendation | Description | Severity |
|--|--|--|
| (Preview) [Code repositories should have code scanning findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsWithRulesBlade/assessmentKey/c68a8c2a-6ed4-454b-9e37-4b7654f2165f/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | Defender for DevOps has found vulnerabilities in code repositories. To improve the security posture of the repositories, it is highly recommended to remediate these vulnerabilities. (No related policy) | Medium |
| (Preview) [Code repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsWithRulesBlade/assessmentKey/4e07c7d0-e06c-47d7-a4a9-8c7b748d1b27/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | Defender for DevOps has found a secret in code repositories.  This should be remediated immediately to prevent a security breach.  Secrets found in repositories can be leaked or discovered by adversaries, leading to compromise of an application or service.  For Azure DevOps, the Microsoft Security DevOps CredScan tool only scans builds on which it has been configured to run.  Therefore, results may not reflect the complete status of secrets in your repositories. (No related policy) | High |
| (Preview) [Code repositories should have Dependabot scanning findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/822425e3-827f-4f35-bc33-33749257f851/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | Defender for DevOps has found vulnerabilities in code repositories. To improve the security posture of the repositories, it is highly recommended to remediate these vulnerabilities. (No related policy) | Medium |
| (Preview) [Code repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/2ebc815f-7bc7-4573-994d-e1cc46fb4a35/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | Defender for DevOps has found infrastructure as code security configuration issues in repositories. The issues shown below have been detected in template files. To improve the security posture of the related cloud resources, it is highly recommended to remediate these issues. (No related policy) | Medium |
| (Preview) [GitHub repositories should have code scanning enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/6672df26-ff2e-4282-83c3-e2f20571bd11/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | GitHub uses code scanning to analyze code in order to find security vulnerabilities and errors in code.  Code scanning can be used to find, triage, and prioritize fixes for existing problems in your code. Code scanning can also prevent developers from introducing new problems. Scans can be scheduled for specific days and times, or scans can be triggered when a specific event occurs in the repository, such as a push. If code scanning finds a potential vulnerability or error in code, GitHub displays an alert in the repository.   A vulnerability is a problem in a project's code that could be exploited to damage the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project. (No related policy) | Medium |
| (Preview) [GitHub repositories should have secret scanning enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/1a600c61-6443-4ab4-bd28-7a6b6fb4691d/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | GitHub scans repositories for known types of secrets, to prevent fraudulent use of secrets that were accidentally committed to repositories.  Secret scanning will scan the entire Git history on all branches present in the GitHub repository for any secrets. Examples of secrets are tokens and private keys that a service provider can issue for authentication. If a secret is checked into a repository, anyone who has read access to the repository can use the secret to access the external service with those privileges. Secrets should be stored in a dedicated, secure location outside the repository for the project. (No related policy) | High |
| (Preview) [GitHub repositories should have Dependabot scanning enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Security/GenericRecommendationDetailsBlade/assessmentKey/92643c1f-1a95-4b68-bbd2-5117f92d6e35/showSecurityCenterCommandBar~/false) | GitHub sends Dependabot alerts when it detects vulnerabilities in code dependencies that affect repositories.  A vulnerability is a problem in a project's code that could be exploited to damage the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the project or other projects that use its code. Vulnerabilities vary in type, severity, and method of attack. When code depends on a package that has a security vulnerability, this vulnerable dependency can cause a range of problems.
