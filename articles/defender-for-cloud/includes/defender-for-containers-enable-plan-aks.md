## Enable the plan

**To enable the plan**:

1. From Defender for Cloud's menu, open the Settings page and select the relevant subscription.

1. In the [Defender plans page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/pricingTier), select **Defender for Containers** and select **Settings**.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the subscription already has Defender for Kubernetes and/or Defender for container registries enabled, an update notice is shown. Otherwise, the only option will be **Defender for Containers**.
    >
    > :::image type="content" source="../media/release-notes/defender-plans-deprecated-indicator.png" alt-text="Defender for container registries and Defender for Kubernetes plans showing 'Deprecated' and upgrade information.":::

1. Turn the relevant component on to enable it.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/defender-for-containers-enable-plan-gke/container-components-on.png" alt-text="screenshot of turning on components." lightbox="../media/defender-for-containers-enable-plan-gke/container-components-on.png":::

    > [!Note]
    > When you turn off Defender for Containers, the components are set to off and are not deployed to any more containers but they are not removed from containers that they are already installed on.

By default, when enabling the plan through the Azure portal, [Microsoft Defender for Containers](../defender-for-containers-introduction.md) is configured to automatically install required components to provide the protections offered by plan, including the assignment of a default workspace.

You can [assign a custom workspace](../defender-for-containers-enable.md?pivots=defender-for-container-aks&tabs=aks-deploy-portal%2ck8s-deploy-asc%2ck8s-verify-asc%2ck8s-remove-arc%2caks-removeprofile-api#assign-a-custom-workspace) through Azure Policy.

If you don't want to automatically install the Defender for Containers monitoring components on your container resources, select **Edit configuration** for the **Containers** plan. Then, in the Settings & monitoring page, turn off automatic installation for each component.

In addition, you can modify this configuration from the [Defender plans page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/SecurityMenuBlade/pricingTier).

If you disable the automatic installation of any component, you can easily deploy the component to one or more clusters using the appropriate recommendation:

- Policy Add-on for Kubernetes - [Azure Kubernetes Service clusters should have the Azure Policy Add-on for Kubernetes installed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/08e628db-e2ed-4793-bc91-d13e684401c3)
- Azure Kubernetes Service profile - [Azure Kubernetes Service clusters should have Defender profile enabled](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/56a83a6e-c417-42ec-b567-1e6fcb3d09a9)
- Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes Defender extension - [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters should have the Defender extension installed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/3ef9848c-c2c8-4ff3-8b9c-4c8eb8ddfce6)
- Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes Policy extension - [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters should have the Azure Policy extension installed](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/0642d770-b189-42ef-a2ce-9dcc3ec6c169)

   > [!Note]
    > Microsoft Defender for Containers is configured to defend all of your clouds automatically. When you install all of the required prerequisites and enable all of the automatic installation capabilities.
    >
    > If you choose to disable all of the automatic installation configuration options, no agents, or components will be deployed to your clusters. Protection will be limited to the agentless features only. Learn which features are agentless in the [availability section](../supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-containers.md) for Defender for Containers.

Learn more about the [roles used to provision Defender for Containers extensions](../permissions.md#roles-used-to-automatically-provision-agents-and-extensions).

## Deploy the Defender agent

You can enable the Defender for Containers plan and deploy all of the relevant components from the Azure portal, the REST API, or with a Resource Manager template. For detailed steps, select the relevant tab.

Once the Defender agent has been deployed, a default workspace will be automatically assigned. You can [assign a custom workspace](../defender-for-containers-enable.md?pivots=defender-for-container-aks&tabs=aks-deploy-portal%2ck8s-deploy-asc%2ck8s-verify-asc%2ck8s-remove-arc%2caks-removeprofile-api#assign-a-custom-workspace) in place of the default workspace through Azure Policy.

> [!NOTE]
> The Defender agent is deployed to each node to provide the runtime protections and collect signals from those nodes using [eBPF technology](https://ebpf.io/).

### [**Azure portal**](#tab/aks-deploy-portal)

### Use the fix button from the Defender for Cloud recommendation

A streamlined, frictionless, process lets you use the Azure portal pages to enable the Defender for Cloud plan and setup auto provisioning of all the necessary components for defending your Kubernetes clusters at scale.

A dedicated Defender for Cloud recommendation provides:

- **Visibility** about which of your clusters has the Defender agent deployed
- **Fix** button to deploy it to those clusters without the agent

1. From Microsoft Defender for Cloud's recommendations page, open the **Enable enhanced security** security control.

1. Use the filter to find the recommendation named **Azure Kubernetes Service clusters should have Defender profile enabled**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Notice the **Fix** icon in the actions column

1. Select the clusters to see the details of the healthy and unhealthy resources - clusters with and without the agent.

1. From the unhealthy resources list, select a cluster and select **Remediate** to open the pane with the remediation confirmation.

1. Select **Fix X resources**.

### [**REST API**](#tab/aks-deploy-rest)

### Use the REST API to deploy the Defender agent

To install the 'SecurityProfile' on an existing cluster with the REST API, run the following PUT command:

```rest
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{{Subscription Id}}/resourcegroups/{{Resource Group}}/providers/Microsoft.Kubernetes/connectedClusters/{{Cluster Name}}/providers/Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration/extensions/microsoft.azuredefender.kubernetes?api-version=2020-07-01-preview
```

                "securityMonitoring": {
                    "enabled": true,
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Request body parameters:

| properties.securityProfile.defender.securityMonitoring.enabled | Determines whether to enable or disable Microsoft Defender for Containers on the cluster | Yes |
| properties.securityProfile.defender.logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId | Log Analytics workspace Azure resource ID | Yes |

### [**Azure CLI**](#tab/k8s-deploy-cli)

### Use Azure CLI to deploy the Defender agent

1. Sign in to Azure:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Ensure that you use the same subscription ID for ``<your-subscription-id>`` as the one associated with your AKS cluster.

1. Enable the Defender agent on your containers:

    - Run the following command to create a new cluster with the Defender agent enabled:

        ```azurecli
        az aks create --enable-defender --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-cluster-name>
        ```

    - Run the following command to enable the Defender agent on an existing cluster:

        ```azurecli
        az aks update --enable-defender --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-cluster-name>
        ```

    A description of all the supported configuration settings on the Defender agent type is given below:

    | Property | Description |
    |----------|-------------|
    | logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId | **Optional**. Full resource ID of your own Log Analytics workspace.<br>When not provided, the default workspace of the region will be used.<br><br>To get the full resource ID, run the following command to display the list of workspaces in your subscriptions in the default JSON format:<br>```az resource list --resource-type Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces -o json```<br><br>The Log Analytics workspace resource ID has the following syntax:<br>/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{your-workspace-name}. <br>Learn more in [Log Analytics workspaces](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md) |

    You can include these settings in a JSON file and specify the JSON file in the `az aks create` and `az aks update` commands with this parameter: `--defender-config <path-to-JSON-file>`. The format of the JSON file must be:

    ```json
    {"logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId": "<workspace-id>"}
    ```

    Learn more about AKS CLI commands in [az aks](/cli/azure/aks).

1. To verify that the agent was successfully added, run the following command on your machine with the `kubeconfig` file pointed to your cluster:

    ```console
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    ```

    When the agent is added, you should see a pod called `microsoft-defender-XXXXX` in `Running` state. It might take a few minutes for pods to be added.

### [**Resource Manager**](#tab/aks-deploy-arm)

### Use Azure Resource Manager to deploy the Defender agent

To use Azure Resource Manager to deploy the Defender agent, you'll need a Log Analytics workspace on your subscription. Learn more in [Log Analytics workspaces](../../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you're new to Resource Manager templates, start here: [What are Azure Resource Manager templates?](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md)

To install the 'SecurityProfile' on an existing cluster with Resource Manager:

```
{ 
    "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters", 
    "apiVersion": "2022-06-01", 
    "name": "string", 
    "location": "string",
    "properties": {
        …
        "securityProfile": { 
            "defender": { 
                "logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId": “logAnalyticsWorkspaceResourceId",
                "securityMonitoring": {
                    "enabled": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
