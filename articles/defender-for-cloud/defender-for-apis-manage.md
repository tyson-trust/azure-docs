## Query your APIs with the cloud security explorer

You can use the cloud security explorer to run graph-based queries on the cloud security graph. By utilizing the cloud security explorer, you can proactively identify potential security risks to your APIs.

There are three types of APIs you can query:

- **API Collections** - A group of all types of API collections.

- **API Endpoints** - A group of all types of API endpoints.

- **API Management** services - API management services are platforms that provide tools and infrastructure for managing APIs, typically through a web-based interface. They often include features such as: API gateway, API portal, API analytics and API security.

**To query APIs in the cloud security graph**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Cloud Security Explorer**.

1. From the drop down menu, select APIs.
