# Discover misconfigurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Once you have set up the Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action or Azure DevOps extension, you can configure the YAML configuration file to run a single tool or multiple tools. For example, you can set up the action or extension to run Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scanning tools only. This can help reduce pipeline run time.

## Prerequisites

- Configure Microsoft Security DevOps for GitHub and/or Azure DevOps based on your source code management system:
  - [Microsoft Security DevOps GitHub action](github-action.md)
  - [Microsoft Security DevOps Azure DevOps extension](azure-devops-extension.md).
- Ensure you have an IaC template in your repository.

## Configure IaC scanning and view the results in GitHub

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com). 

1. Navigate to **`your repository's home page`** > **.github/workflows** > **msdevopssec.yml** that was created in the [prerequisites](github-action.md#configure-the-microsoft-security-devops-github-action-1).    

1. Select **Edit file**.

1. Under the Run Analyzers section, add:

    ```yml
    with:
        categories: 'IaC'
    ```

    > [!NOTE] 
    > Categories are case sensitive.
    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-iac-vulnerabilities/add-to-yaml.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the information that needs to be added to the yaml file.":::

1. Select **Start Commit** 

1. Select **Commit changes**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-iac-vulnerabilities/commit-change.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to select commit change on the githib page.":::

1. (Optional) Add an IaC template to your repository. Skip if you already have an IaC template in your repository.

    For example, [commit an IaC template to deploy a basic Linux web application](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/quickstarts/microsoft.web/webapp-basic-linux) to your repository.

    1. Select `azuredeploy.json`.
    
        :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-iac-vulnerabilities/deploy-json.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the azuredeploy.json file is located.":::

    1. Select **Raw**
    
    1. Copy all the information in the file.

        ```json
        {
          "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",

## View details and remediation information on IaC rules included with Microsoft Security DevOps

The IaC scanning tools that are included with Microsoft Security DevOps, are [Template Analyzer](https://github.com/Azure/template-analyzer) (which contains [PSRule](https://aka.ms/ps-rule-azure)) and [Terrascan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan). 

Template Analyzer runs rules on ARM and Bicep templates. You can learn more about [Template Analyzer's rules and remediation details](https://github.com/Azure/template-analyzer/blob/main/docs/built-in-rules.md#built-in-rules).

Terrascan runs rules on ARM, CloudFormation, Docker, Helm, Kubernetes, Kustomize, and Terraform templates. You can learn more about the [Terrascan rules](https://runterrascan.io/docs/policies/).
