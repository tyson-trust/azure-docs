1. Select an unhealthy cluster.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must select the clusters one at a time.
    >
    > Don't select the clusters by their hyperlinked names: select anywhere else in the relevant row.

1. Select **Fix**.

1. Defender for Cloud generates a script in the language of your choice:
    - For Linux, select **Bash**.
    - For Windows, select **PowerShell**.

1. Select **Download remediation logic**.
