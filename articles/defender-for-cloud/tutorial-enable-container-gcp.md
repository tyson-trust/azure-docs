# Protect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project containers with Defender for Containers

Defender for Containers in Microsoft Defender for Cloud is the cloud-native solution that is used to secure your containers so you can improve, monitor, and maintain the security of your clusters, containers, and their applications.

Learn more about [Overview of Microsoft Defender for Containers](defender-for-containers-introduction.md).

You can learn more about Defender for Container's pricing on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

## Prerequisites

- You must [enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud](get-started.md#enable-defender-for-cloud-on-your-azure-subscription) on your Azure subscription.

- [Connect your GCP projects to Microsoft Defender for Cloud](quickstart-onboard-gcp.md#connect-your-gcp-project).

- Validate the following domains only if you're using a relevant OS.

    | Domain                     | Port | Host operating systems |
    | -------------------------- | ---- |--|
    | amazonlinux.*.amazonaws.com/2/extras/\* | 443 | Amazon Linux 2 |

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. In the Defender for Cloud menu, select **Environment settings**.

1. Select the relevant GCP project.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable or disable individual Defender for Containers capabilities, either globally or for specific resources, see [How to enable Microsoft Defender for Containers components](defender-for-containers-enable.md).

## Deploy the solution to specific clusters

If you disabled any of the default auto provisioning configurations to Off, during the [GCP connector onboarding process](quickstart-onboard-gcp.md#configure-the-defender-for-containers-plan), or afterwards. You need to manually install Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes, the Defender agent, and Azure Policy for Kubernetes to each of your GKE clusters to get the full security value out of Defender for Containers.

There are two dedicated Defender for Cloud recommendations you can use to install the extensions (and Arc if necessary):

- `GKE clusters should have Microsoft Defender's extension for Azure Arc installed`
- `GKE clusters should have the Azure Policy extension installed`

> [!NOTE]
> When installing Arc extensions, you must verify that the GCP project provided is identical to the one in the relevant connector.

**To deploy the solution to specific clusters**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**.

1. In the Defender for Cloud menu, select **Recommendations**.

1. From Defender for Cloud's **Recommendations** page, search for one of the recommendations by name.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-containers-gcp/recommendation-search.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to search for the recommendation." lightbox="media/tutorial-enable-containers-gcp/recommendation-search-expanded.png":::

1. Select an unhealthy GKE cluster.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You must select the clusters one at a time.
    >
    > Don't select the clusters by their hyperlinked names: select anywhere else in the relevant row.

1. Select the name of the unhealthy resource.

1. Select **Fix**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-enable-containers-gcp/fix-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the location of the fix button.":::

1. Defender for Cloud generates a script in the language of your choice:
    - For Linux, select **Bash**.
    - For Windows, select **PowerShell**.

1. Select **Download remediation logic**.

1. Run the generated script on your cluster.

1. Repeat steps *3 through 10* for the second recommendation.
