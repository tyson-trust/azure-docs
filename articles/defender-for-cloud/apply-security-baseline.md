# Review hardening recommendations

To reduce a machine's attack surface and avoid known risks, it's important to configure the operating system (OS) as securely as possible.

The Microsoft cloud security benchmark has guidance for OS hardening which has led to security baseline documents for [Windows](../governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-windows.md) and [Linux](../governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-linux.md).

Use the security recommendations described in this article to assess the machines in your environment and:

- Identify gaps in the security configurations
- Learn how to remediate those gaps

## What are the hardening recommendations?

Microsoft Defender for Cloud includes two recommendations that check whether the configuration of Windows and Linux machines in your environment meet the Azure security baseline configurations:

- For **Windows** machines, [Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Windows machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/8c3d9ad0-3639-4686-9cd2-2b2ab2609bda) compares the configuration with the [Windows security baseline](../governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-windows.md).
- For **Linux** machines, [Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Linux machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1f655fb7-63ca-4980-91a3-56dbc2b715c6) compares the configuration with the [Linux security baseline](../governance/policy/samples/guest-configuration-baseline-linux.md).

These recommendations use the guest configuration feature of Azure Policy to compare the OS configuration of a machine with the baseline defined in the [Microsoft cloud security benchmark](/security/benchmark/azure/overview).

## Compare machines in your subscriptions with the OS security baselines

To compare machines with the OS security baselines:

1. From Defender for Cloud's portal pages, open the **Recommendations** page.
1. Select the relevant recommendation:
    - For **Windows** machines, [Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Windows machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/8c3d9ad0-3639-4686-9cd2-2b2ab2609bda)
    - For **Linux** machines, [Vulnerabilities in security configuration on your Linux machines should be remediated (powered by Guest Configuration)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/1f655fb7-63ca-4980-91a3-56dbc2b715c6)

1. On the recommendation details page you can see:
    1. The affected resources.
    1. The specific security checks that failed.

1. To learn more about a specific finding, select it.

1. Other investigation possibilities:

    - To view the list of machines that have been assessed, open **Affected resources**.
    - To view the list of findings for one machine, select a machine from the **Unhealthy resources** tab. A page will open listing only the findings for that machine.

## Next steps

In this document, you learned how to use Defender for Cloud's guest configuration recommendations to compare the hardening of your OS with the Azure security baseline.
