# How to use the IoT Central REST API to upload a file

IoT Central lets you upload media and other files from connected devices to cloud storage. You configure the file upload capability in your IoT Central application, and then implement file uploads in your device code. In this article, learn how to:

* Use the REST API to configure the file upload capability in your IoT Central application.
* Test the file upload by running some sample device code.

The IoT Central REST API lets you:

* Add a file upload storage account configuration
* Update a file upload storage account configuration
* Get the file upload storage account configuration
* Delete the file upload storage configuration

Every IoT Central REST API call requires an authorization header. To learn more, see [How to authenticate and authorize IoT Central REST API calls](howto-authorize-rest-api.md).

For the reference documentation for the IoT Central REST API, see [Azure IoT Central REST API reference](/rest/api/iotcentral/).

[!INCLUDE [iot-central-postman-collection](../../../includes/iot-central-postman-collection.md)]

To learn how to upload files by using the IoT Central UI, see [How to configure file uploads.](../core/howto-configure-file-uploads.md)

## Prerequisites

To test the file upload, install the following prerequisites in your local development environment:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## Add a file upload storage account configuration

To add a file upload storage account configuration:

### Create a storage account

To use the Azure Storage REST API, you need a bearer token for the `management.azure.com` resource. To get a bearer token, you can use the Azure CLI:

```azurecli
az account get-access-token --resource https://management.azure.com
```

If you don't have a storage account for your blobs, you can use the following request to create one in your subscription:

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}?api-version=2021-09-01

```

The request headers have the following fields:

* `subscriptionId` : The ID of the target subscription.
* `resourceGroupName`:  The name of the resource group in your subscription. The name is case insensitive.
* `accountName` : The name of the storage account within the specified resource group. Storage account names must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower-case letters only.

The request body has the following required fields:

* `kind` : Type of storage account
* `location` : The geo-location where the resource lives
* `sku`: The SKU name.

```json
{
 "kind": "BlockBlobStorage",
 "location": "West US",
 "sku": "Premium_LRS"
}
```

### Create a container

Use the following request to create a container called `fileuploads` in your storage account for your blobs:

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}/blobServices/default/containers/fileuploads?api-version=2021-09-01
```

* `containerName` : Blob container names must be between 3 and 63 characters in length and use numbers, lower-case letters and dash (-) only. Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number.

Send an empty request body with this request that looks like the following example:

```json
{
}
```

The response to this request looks like the following example:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/yourResourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/yourAccountName/blobServices/default/containers/fileuploads",
  "name": "fileuploads",
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers"
}
```

### Get the storage account keys

Use the following request to retrieve that storage account keys that you need when you configure the upload in IoT Central:

```http
POST https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/{accountName}/listKeys?api-version=2021-09-01
```

The response to this request looks like the following example:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "creationTime": "2022-05-19T19:22:40.9132287Z",
      "keyName": "key1",
      "value": "j3UTm**************==",
      "permissions": "FULL"
    },
    {
      "creationTime": "2022-05-19T19:22:40.9132287Z",
      "keyName": "key2",
      "value": "Nbs3W**************==",
      "permissions": "FULL"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create the upload configuration

Use the following request to create a file upload blob storage account configuration in your IoT Central application:

```http
PUT https://{your-app-subdomain}.azureiotcentral.com/api/fileUploads?api-version=2022-07-31
```

The request body has the following fields:

* `account`: The storage account name where to upload the file to.
* `connectionString`: The connection string to connect to the storage account. Use one of the `value` values from the previous `listKeys` request as the `AccountKey` value.
* `container`: The name of the container inside the storage account. The following example uses the name `fileuploads`.
* `etag`: ETag to prevent conflict with multiple uploads
* `sasTtl`: ISO 8601 duration standard, The amount of time the deviceâ€™s request to upload a file is valid before it expires.

```json
{
  "account": "yourAccountName",
  "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=*****;BlobEndpoint=https://yourAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/",
  "container": "fileuploads",
  "sasTtl": "PT1H"
}
```

The response to this request looks like the following example:

```json
{
  "account": "yourAccountName",
  "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=*****;BlobEndpoint=https://yourAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/",
  "container": "fileuploads",
  "sasTtl": "PT1H",
  "state": "pending",
  "etag": "\"7502ac89-0000-0300-0000-627eaf100000\""

}
```

## Get the file upload storage account configuration

Use the following request to retrieve details of a file upload blob storage account configuration in your IoT Central application:

```http
GET https://{your-app-subdomain}.azureiotcentral.com/api/fileUploads?api-version=2022-07-31
```

The response to this request looks like the following example:

```json
{
  "account": "yourAccountName",
  "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=*****;BlobEndpoint=https://yourAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/",
  "container": "yourContainerName",
  "state": "succeeded",
  "etag": "\"7502ac89-0000-0300-0000-627eaf100000\""

}
```

## Update the file upload storage account configuration

Use the following request to update a file upload blob storage account connection string in your IoT Central application:

```http
PATCH https://{your-app-subdomain}.azureiotcentral.com/api/fileUploads?api-version=2022-07-31
```

```json
{
  "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=*****;BlobEndpoint=https://yourAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/"
}
```

The response to this request looks like the following example:

```json

{
  "account": "yourAccountName",
  "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=*****;BlobEndpoint=https://yourAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/",
  "container": "yourContainerName",
  "sasTtl": "PT1H",
  "state": "succeeded",
  "etag": "\"7502ac89-0000-0300-0000-627eaf100000\""
}
```

## Remove the file upload storage account configuration

Use the following request to delete a  storage account configuration:

```http
DELETE https://{your-app-subdomain}.azureiotcentral.com/api/fileUploads?api-version=2022-07-31
```

## Test file upload

After you [configure file uploads](#add-a-file-upload-storage-account-configuration) in your IoT Central application, you can test it with the sample code. If you haven't already cloned the file upload sample repository, use the following commands to clone it to a suitable location on your local machine and install the dependent packages:

```cmd/sh
git clone https://github.com/azure-Samples/iot-central-file-upload-device
cd iotc-file-upload-device
npm i
npm build
```

### Create the device template and import the model

To test the file upload, you run a sample device application. Create a device template for the sample device to use.

1. Open your application in IoT Central UI.

1. Navigate to the **Device Templates** tab in the left pane, select **+ New**:

1. Choose **IoT device** as the template type.

1. On the **Customize** page of the wizard, enter a name such as *File Upload Device Sample* for the device template.

1. On the **Review** page, select **Create**.

1. Select **Import a model** and upload the *FileUploadDeviceDcm.json* model file from the folder `iotc-file-upload-device\setup` in the repository you downloaded previously.

1. Select **Publish** to publish the device template.

### Add a device

To add a device to your Azure IoT Central application:

1. Choose **Devices** on the left pane.

1. Select the *File Upload Device Sample* device template that you created earlier.

1. Select + **New** and select **Create**.

1. Select the device that you created and Select **Connect**

Copy the values for `ID scope`, `Device ID`, and `Primary key`. You use these values in the device sample code.

### Run the sample code

Open the git repository you downloaded in VS Code. Create an ".env" file at the root of your project and add the values you copied previously. The file should look like the following sample with the values you made a note of previously.

```cmd/sh
scopeId=<YOUR_SCOPE_ID>
deviceId=<YOUR_DEVICE_ID>
deviceKey=<YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY>
modelId=dtmi:IoTCentral:IotCentralFileUploadDevice;1
```

Open the git repository you downloaded in VS Code. Press F5 to run/debug the sample. In your terminal window you see that the device is registered and is connected to IoT Central:

```cmd/sh
Starting IoT Central device...
 > Machine: Windows_NT, 8 core, freemem=6674mb, totalmem=16157mb
Starting device registration...
DPS registration succeeded
Connecting the device...
IoT Central successfully connected device: 7z1xo26yd8
Sending telemetry: {
    "TELEMETRY_SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT": 1
}
Sending telemetry: {
    "TELEMETRY_SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT": 1
}
Sending telemetry: {
    "TELEMETRY_SYSTEM_HEARTBEAT": 1
}

```

The sample project comes with a sample file named *datafile.json*. This file is uploaded when you use the **Upload File** command in your IoT Central application.

To test the upload, open your application and select the device you created. Select the **Command** tab and you see a button named **Run**. When you select that button the IoT Central app calls a direct method on your device to upload the file. You can see this direct method in the sample code in the /device.ts file. The method is named *uploadFileCommand*.

Select the **Raw data** tab to verify the file upload status.
