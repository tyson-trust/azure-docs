# Display feature information in the iOS SDK (Preview)

Spatial data is often represented using points, lines, and polygons. This data often has metadata information associated with it. For example, a point may represent the location of a restaurant and metadata about that restaurant may be its name, address, and type of food it serves. This metadata can be added as properties of a GeoJSON `Feature`. The following code creates a simple point feature with a `title` property that has a value of `"Hello World!"`.

```swift
// Create a data source and add it to the map.
let source = DataSource()
map.sources.add(source)

// Create a point feature.
let feature = Feature(Point(CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: -122.33, longitude: 47.64)))

// Add a property to the feature.
feature.addProperty("title", value: "Hello World!")

// Create a point feature, pass in the metadata properties, and add it to the data source.
source.add(feature: feature)
```

For more information on how to create and add data to the map, see [Create a data source].

When a user interacts with a feature on the map, events can be used to react to those actions. A common scenario is to display a message made of the metadata properties of a feature the user interacted with. The `azureMap(_:didTapOn:)` event is the main event used to detect when the user tapped a feature on the map. There's also an `azureMap(_:didLongPressOn:)` event. When a delegate is added to the map, it can be limited to a single layer by passing in the ID of a layer to limit it to. If no layer ID is passed in, tapping any feature on the map, regardless of which layer it is in, would fire this event. The following code creates a symbol layer to render point data on the map, then adds a delegate, limited to this symbol layer, which handles the `azureMap(_:didTapOn:)` event.

```swift
// Create a symbol and add it to the map.
let layer = SymbolLayer(source: source)
map.layers.addLayer(layer)

// Add the delegate to the map to handle feature tap events on the layer only.
map.events.addDelegate(self, for: [layer.id])
```

```swift
func azureMap(_ map: AzureMap, didTapOn features: [Feature]) {
    // Retrieve the title property of the feature as a string.
    let title = features.first?.properties["title"] as? String

    // Do something with the title.
}
```

## Display an alert

An alert is one of the easiest ways to display information to the user and is available in all typically supported versions of iOS. If you want to quickly let the user know something about what they tapped on, an alert might be a good option. The following code shows how an alert can be used with the `azureMap(_:didTapOn:)` event.

```swift
func azureMap(_ map: AzureMap, didTapOn features: [Feature]) {
    // Retrieve the title property of the feature as a string.
    let title = features.first?.properties["title"] as? String

    // Display an alert with the title information.
    let alert = UIAlertController(title: title, message: nil, preferredStyle: .alert)
    alert.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: "OK", style: .cancel))
    present(alert, animated: true)
}
```

In addition to alerts, there are many other ways to present the metadata properties of a feature, such as:

- Add a custom view over the map
- Add a child view controller over the map
- Present modally another view controller over the current one.
- Navigate to another view controller.

## Display a popup

The Azure Maps iOS SDK provides a `Popup` class that makes it easy to create UI annotation elements that are anchored to a position on the map. For popups, you have to pass in a self-sizing view into the `content` option of the popup. Here's a simple view example that displays dark text on top of a white background.

```swift
class PopupTextView: UIView {
    private let textLabel: UILabel = {
        let label = UILabel()
        label.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        label.numberOfLines = 0
        label.textColor = UIColor(red: 34 / 255, green: 34 / 255, blue: 34 / 255, alpha: 1)
        label.font = .systemFont(ofSize: 18)
        return label
    }()

    override init(frame: CGRect) {
        super.init(frame: frame)
        setup()
    }

    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        super.init(coder: coder)
    }

    override func awakeFromNib() {
        super.awakeFromNib()
        setup()
    }

    private func setup() {
        backgroundColor = .white
        addSubview(textLabel)

        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            textLabel.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: topAnchor, constant: 10),
            textLabel.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: bottomAnchor, constant: -10),
            textLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: leadingAnchor, constant: 10),
            textLabel.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: trailingAnchor, constant: -25)
        ])
    }

    func setText(_ text: String) {
        textLabel.text = text
    }
}
```

The following code creates a popup, adds it to the map. When a feature is tapped, the `title` property is displayed using the `PopupTextView` class, with the bottom center of the layout anchored to the specified position on the map.

```swift
// Create a popup and add it to the map.
let popup = Popup()
map.popups.add(popup)

// Set popup to the class property to use in events handling later.
self.popup = popup
```

```swift
func azureMap(_ map: AzureMap, didTapOn features: [Feature]) {
    guard let popup = popup, let feature = features.first else {
        // Popup has been released or no features provided
        return
    }

    // Create the custom view for the popup.
    let customView = PopupTextView()

    // Set the text to the custom view.
    let text = feature.properties["title"] as! String
    customView.setText(text)

    // Get the position of the tapped feature.
    let position = Math.positions(from: feature).first!

    // Set the options on the popup.
    popup.setOptions([
        // Set the popups position.
        .position(position),

        // Set the anchor point of the popup content.
        .anchor(.bottom),

        // Set the content of the popup.
        .content(customView)

        // Optionally, hide the close button of the popup.
        // .closeButton(false)

        // Optionally offset the popup by a specified number of points.
        // .pointOffset(CGPoint(x: 10, y: 10))
    ])

    // Open the popup.
    popup.open()
}
```

The following screen capture shows popups appearing when features are tapped and staying anchored to their specified location on the map as it moves.
