# Azure Maps traffic coverage

The Azure Maps [Traffic service] is a suite of web services designed for developers to create web and mobile applications around real-time traffic. This data can be visualized on maps or used to generate smarter routes that factor in current driving conditions.

The following tables provide information about what kind of traffic information you can request from each country or region. If a market is missing in the following tables, it isn't currently supported.

- **Incidents**: Provides an accurate view about traffic jams and incidents around a road network.
- **Flow**: Provides real time observed speeds and travel times for all key roads in a network.
