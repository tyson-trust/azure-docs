# Azure Maps render coverage

The render coverage tables below list the countries/regions that support Azure Maps road tiles. Both raster and vector tiles are supported. At the lowest resolution, the entire world fits in a single tile. At the highest resolution, a single tile represents 38 square meters. You'll see more details about continents, regions, cities, and individual streets as you zoom in the map. For more information about tiles, see [Zoom levels and tile grid](zoom-levels-and-tile-grid.md).
