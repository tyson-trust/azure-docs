## Supportability of open-source projects

All Azure Maps open-source projects and samples use supported and recommended techniques and are:

- Created and maintained by Microsoft and the community.
- A community initiative â€“ people who work on the initiative for the benefit of others, and have their normal day job as well.
- NOT a product, and not supported by Premier Support or other official support channels.
- Supported in similar ways as other open-source projects done by Microsoft with support from the community by the community.
