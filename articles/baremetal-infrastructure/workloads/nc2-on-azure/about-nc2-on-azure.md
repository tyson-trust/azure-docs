## **Azure Hybrid Benefits (AHUB) for NC2 on Azure**

### Azure Commercial benefits

**Cost Savings:** Leverage software investments to reduce costs in Azure

**Flexibility:** Use software commitments to run on-premises or in Azure, and shift from one to the other over time

**Unique to Azure:** Achieve savings unmatched by other cloud providers

Available licensing offers are:

1. Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server
2. Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server
3. Extended Security Updates (ESU)

### Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server

- Convert or re-use Windows licensing with active software assurance in Azure for NC2 BareMetal hardware.
- Re-use Windows Server on up to 2 VMs and up to 16 cores in Azure.
- Run virtual machines on-premises **and** in Azure. Significantly reduce costs compared to running Windows Server in other public clouds

### Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server

Azure-only benefit for customers with active SA (or subscriptions) on SQL cores

Advantages of the hybrid benefit over license mobility when adopting IaaS are:

- Use the SQL cores on-premises and in Azure simultaneously for up to 180 days, to allow for migration.
- Available for SQL Server core licenses only.
- No need to complete and submit license verification forms.
- The hybrid benefit for windows and SQL can be used together for IaaS (PaaS abstracts the OS)

### Extended Security Updates (ESU) – for Windows Server**

NC2 on Azure requires manual escalation to request, approve and deliver ESI keys to the client.

- ESUs for deployment to the platforms below are intended to be free of charge (Azure and Azure connected), however unlike the majority of VMs on Azure today, MSFT cannot provide automatic updates. Rather, clients must request keys and install the updates themselves.
- For regular on-premises customers – there is no manual escalation process; these customers must work with VLSC and EA processes. To be eligible to purchase ESUs for on-premises deployment, customers must have Software Assurance.

#### To request ESI keys

1. Draft an email that is sent to your Microsoft Account team, The email should contain the following:
   1. Your contact information in the body of the email
   1. Customer name and TPID
   1. Specific Deployment Scenario: Nutanix Cloud Clusters on Azure
   1. Number of Servers, nodes, or both where applicable (for example,HUB) requested to be covered by ESUs
   1. Point of Contact: Name and email address of a customer employee who can either install or manage the keys once provided. Manage in this context means ensuring that
      1. Keys are not disclosed to anyone outside of the client company
      2. Keys are not publicly exposed
1.  Do not cc the customer at this stage. The MSFT response will include the ESU Keys and the following language:

>> **Terms of Use**

>> By activating this key you agree that it will only be used for only NC1 on Azure. If you violate these terms, we may stop providing services to you or we may close your Microsoft account.

For any questions on Azure Hybrid Benefits, please contact your Microsoft Account Executive.
