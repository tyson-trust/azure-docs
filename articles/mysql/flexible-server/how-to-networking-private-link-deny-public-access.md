# Deny Public Network Access in Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server using Azure portal (Preview)

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-flexible-server.md)]

This article describes how you can configure an Azure Database for MySQL flexible server to deny all public configurations and allow only connections through private endpoints to enhance network security further.

## Deny public access during the creation of MySQL flexible server

1. When creating an [Azure Database for MySQL flexible server](quickstart-create-server-portal.md) in the Networking tab, choose *Public access (allowed IP addresses) and Private endpoint* as the connectivity method.

1. To disable public access on the MySQL flexible server you are creating, uncheck Allow public access to this resource through the internet using a public IP address under *Public access*.

1. After entering the remaining information in the other tabs, select on *Review + Create* to deploy the MySQL flexible server without public access.

## Deny public access to an existing MySQL flexible server

> [!NOTE]  
> The MySQL flexible server must have been deployed with **Public access (allowed IP addresses) and Private endpoint** as the connectivity method to implement this.

1. On the MySQL flexible server page, under **Settings**, select **Networking**.

1. To disable public access on the MySQL flexible server, uncheck Allow public access to this resource through the internet using a public IP address under **Public access**.
