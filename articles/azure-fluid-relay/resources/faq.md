## What network protocols does Fluid Relay use?

Fluid Relay, like the Fluid Framework technology, uses both http and web sockets for communication between the clients and the service.

## Will Azure Fluid Relay work in environments where web sockets are blocked?

Yes. The Fluid Framework uses socket.io library for communication with the service. In environments where web sockets are blocked, the client will fall back to use long-polling with http.

## Where does Azure Fluid Relay store customer data?

Azure Fluid Relay stores customer data. By default, customer data is replicated to the paired region. However, the customer can choose to keep it within the same region by selecting the Basic SKU during provisioning. This option is available in select regions where the paired region is outside the boundary of the primary country/region data is stored. For more information, go to [Data storage in Azure Fluid Relay](../concepts/data-storage.md).

## Does Azure Fluid Relay support offline mode?

Offline mode is when end users of your application are disconnected from the network. The Fluid Framework client accumulates operations locally and sends them to the service when reconnected. Currently, Azure Fluid Relay doesn't support extended periods of offline mode beyond 1 minute. We highly recommend that you listen to Disconnect signals and update your user experience to avoid accumulation of many ops that can get lost.
