# Monitor App Service instances using Health check

This article uses Health check in the Azure portal to monitor App Service instances. Health check increases your application's availability by rerouting requests away from unhealthy instances and replacing instances if they remain unhealthy. It does that by pinging every minute a path of your web application of your choice. 

![Health check failure][1]

Note that _/api/health_ is just an example added for illustration purposes. We do not create a Health Check path by default. You should make sure that the path you are selecting is a valid path that exists within your application

## What App Service does with Health checks

- When given a path on your app, Health check pings this path on all instances of your App Service app at 1-minute intervals.
- If an instance doesn't respond with a status code between 200-299 (inclusive) after 10 requests, App Service determines it's unhealthy and removes it from the load balancer for this Web App. The required number of failed requests for an instance to be deemed unhealthy is configurable to a minimum of two requests.
- After removal, Health check continues to ping the unhealthy instance. If the instance begins to respond with a healthy status code (200-299), then the instance is returned to the load balancer.
- If an instance remains unhealthy for one hour, it's replaced with a new instance.
- When scaling out, App Service pings the Health check path to ensure new instances are ready.

> [!NOTE]
>- Health check doesn't follow 302 redirects. 
>- At most one instance will be replaced per hour, with a maximum of three instances per day per App Service Plan.
>- If your health check is giving the status `Waiting for health check response` then the check is likely failing due to an HTTP status code of 307, which can happen if you have HTTPS redirect enabled but have `HTTPS Only` disabled.

## Enable Health check

![Health check navigation in Azure portal][3]

1. To enable Health check, browse to the Azure portal and select your App Service app.
2. Under **Monitoring**, select **Health check**.
3. Select **Enable** and provide a valid URL path on your application, such as `/health` or `/api/health`.
4. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> - Your [App Service plan](./overview-hosting-plans.md) should be scaled to two or more instances to fully utilize Health check. 
> - The Health check path should check critical components of your application. For example, if your application depends on a database and a messaging system, the Health check endpoint should connect to those components. If the application can't connect to a critical component, then the path should return a 500-level response code to indicate the app is unhealthy. Also, if the path does not return a response within 1 minute, the health check ping is considered unhealthy.
> - When selecting the Health check path, make sure you're selecting a path that returns a 200 status code, only when the app is fully warmed up.
> - In order to use Health check on your Function App, you must use a [premium or dedicated hosting plan](../azure-functions/functions-scale.md#overview-of-plans).

> [!CAUTION]
> Health check configuration changes restart your app. To minimize impact to production apps, we recommend [configuring staging slots](deploy-staging-slots.md) and swapping to production.

### Configuration

In addition to configuring the Health check options, you can also configure the following [app settings](configure-common.md):

| App setting name | Allowed values | Description |
|-|-|-|
|`WEBSITE_HEALTHCHECK_MAXPINGFAILURES` | 2 - 10 | The required number of failed requests for an instance to be deemed unhealthy and removed from the load balancer. For example, when set to `2`, your instances are removed after `2` failed pings. (Default value is `10`) |
|`WEBSITE_HEALTHCHECK_MAXUNHEALTHYWORKERPERCENT` | 1 - 100 | By default, no more than half of the instances will be excluded from the load balancer at one time to avoid overwhelming the remaining healthy instances. For example, if an App Service Plan is scaled to four instances and three are unhealthy, two are excluded. The other two instances (one healthy and one unhealthy) continue to receive requests. In the worst-case scenario where all instances are unhealthy, none are excluded. <br /> To override this behavior, set app setting to a value between `1` and `100`. A higher value means more unhealthy instances are removed (default value is `50`). |

#### Authentication and security

Health check integrates with App Service's [authentication and authorization features](overview-authentication-authorization.md). No other settings are required if these security features are enabled.

If you're using your own authentication system, the Health check path must allow anonymous access. To secure the Health check endpoint, you should first use features such as [IP restrictions](app-service-ip-restrictions.md#set-an-ip-address-based-rule), [client certificates](app-service-ip-restrictions.md#set-an-ip-address-based-rule), or a Virtual Network to restrict application access. Once you have those features in-place, you can authenticate the health check request by inspecting the header, `x-ms-auth-internal-token`, and validating that it matches the SHA256 hash of the environment variable `WEBSITE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. If they match, then the health check request is valid and originating from App Service.

/// <summary>
/// Method <c>HeaderMatchesEnvVar</c> returns true if <c>headerValue</c> matches WEBSITE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY.

public Boolean HeaderMatchesEnvVar(string headerValue) {
    var sha = System.Security.Cryptography.SHA256.Create();
    String envVar = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY");
    String hash = System.Convert.ToBase64String(sha.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(envVar)));
    return hash == headerValue;
}
```

    env_var = os.getenv('WEBSITE_AUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY')
    hash = base64.b64encode(sha256(env_var.encode('utf-8')).digest()).decode('utf-8')
    return hash == header_value
```

    String hash = new String(Base64.getDecoder().decode(digest.digest(envVar.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))));
    return hash == headerValue;
}
```

##### [Node.js](#tab/node)

    return hash == headerValue;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `x-ms-auth-internal-token` header is only available on Windows App Service.

## Instances
Once Health Check is enabled, you can restart and monitor the status of your application instances through the instances tab. The instances tab shows your instance's name, the status of that instance and gives you the option to manually restart the application instance.

If the status of your instance is unhealthy, you can restart the instance manually using the restart button in the table.  Keep in mind that any other applications hosted on the same App Service Plan as the instance will also be affected by the restart.  If there are other applications using the same App Service Plan as the instance, they are listed on the opening blade from the restart button.

If you restart the instance and the restart process fails, you will then be given the option to replace the worker (only 1 instance can be replaced per hour).  This will also affect any applications using the same App Service Plan.

Windows applications will also have the option to view processes via the Process Explorer.  This gives you further insight on the instance's processes including thread count, private memory, and total CPU time.

## Diagnostic information collection
For Windows applications, you have the option to collect diagnostic information in the Health Check tab. Enabling diagnostic collection adds an auto-heal rule that creates memory dumps for unhealthy instances and saves it to a designated storage account. Enabling this option changes auto-heal configurations. If there are existing auto-heal rules, we recommend setting this up through App Service diagnostics. 

Once diagnostic collection is enabled, you can create or choose an existing storage account for your files. You can only select storage accounts in the same region as your application. Keep in mind that saving restarts your application. After saving, if your site instances are found to be unhealthy after continuous pings, you can go to your storage account resource and view the memory dumps.


## Monitoring

After providing your application's Health check path, you can monitor the health of your site using Azure Monitor. From the **Health check** blade in the Portal, select the **Metrics** in the top toolbar. This will open a new blade where you can see the site's historical health status and option to create a new alert rule. Health check metrics aggregate the successful pings & display failures only when the instance was deemed unhealthy based on the health check configuration. For more information on monitoring your sites, [see the guide on Azure Monitor](web-sites-monitor.md).

## Limitations

- Health check can be enabled for **Free** and **Shared** App Service Plans so you can have metrics on the site's health and setup alerts, but because **Free** and **Shared** sites can't scale out, any unhealthy instances won't be replaced. You should scale up to the **Basic** tier or higher so you can scale out to 2 or more instances and utilize the full benefit of Health check. This is recommended for production-facing applications as it will increase your app's availability and performance.
- The App Service plan can have a maximum of one unhealthy instance replaced per hour and, at most, three instances per day.
- There's a non-configurable limit on the total number of instances replaced by Health Check per scale unit. If this limit is reached, no unhealthy instances are replaced. This value gets reset every 12 hours.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if my app is running on a single instance?

If your app is only scaled to one instance and becomes unhealthy, it will not be removed from the load balancer because that would take down your application entirely. However, after one hour of continuous unhealthy pings, the instance is replaced. Scale out to two or more instances to get the rerouting benefit of Health check. If your app is running on a single instance, you can still use Health check's [monitoring](#monitoring) feature to keep track of your application's health.
 
### Why are the Health check requests not showing in my web server logs?

The Health check requests are sent to your site internally, so the request won't show in [the web server logs](troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md#enable-web-server-logging). This also means the request will have an origin of `127.0.0.1` since the request is being sent internally. You can add log statements in your Health check code to keep logs of when your Health check path is pinged.

### Are the Health check requests sent over HTTP or HTTPS?

On Windows App Service, the Health check requests are sent via HTTPS when [HTTPS Only](configure-ssl-bindings.md#enforce-https) is enabled on the site. Otherwise, they're sent over HTTP. On Linux App Service, the health check requests are only sent over HTTP and can't be sent over HTTP**S** at this time.

### Is Health check following the application code configured redirects between the default domain and the custom domain?

No, the Health check feature is pinging the path of the default domain of the web application. If there is a redirect from the default domain to a custom domain, then the status code that Health check is returning is not going to be a 200 but a redirect (301), which is going to mark the worker unhealthy.


### What if I have multiple apps on the same App Service Plan?

Unhealthy instances will always be removed from the load balancer rotation regardless of other apps on the App Service Plan (up to the percentage specified in [`WEBSITE_HEALTHCHECK_MAXUNHEALTHYWORKERPERCENT`](#configuration)). When an app on an instance remains unhealthy for over one hour, the instance will only be replaced if all other apps with Health check enabled are also unhealthy. Apps that don't have Health check enabled won't be taken into account. 

#### Example 

Imagine you have two applications (or one app with a slot) with Health check enabled, called App A and App B. They are on the same App Service Plan and that the Plan is scaled out to four instances. If App A becomes unhealthy on two instances, the load balancer stops sending requests to App A on those two instances. Requests are still routed to App B on those instances assuming App B is healthy. If App A remains unhealthy for over an hour on those two instances, those instances are only replaced if App B is **also** unhealthy on those instances. If App B is healthy, the instance isn't replaced.

![Visual diagram explaining the example scenario above.][2]

> [!NOTE]
> If there were another site or slot on the Plan (Site C) without Health check enabled, it would not be taken into consideration for the instance replacement.

### What if all my instances are unhealthy?

In the scenario where all instances of your application are unhealthy, App Service will not remove instances from the load balancer. In this scenario, taking all unhealthy app instances out of the load balancer rotation would effectively cause an outage for your application; however, the instances replacement will still be honored.

### Does Health check work on App Service Environments?

Yes, health check is available for the App Service Environment v3, but not for versions 1 or 2. If you are using the older versions of the App Service Environment, you can use the [migration feature](environment/migrate.md) to migrate your App Service Environment to version 3.
