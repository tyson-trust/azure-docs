## Back up & restore vs. disaster recovery

| Platform | Back up & restore guidance  | Disaster recovery guidance |
|------|-----|-----|
|App Service Web Apps<br>(Free & Shared Pricing Tier)|If you have web applications deployed to the Free or Shared tier and require access to Back up and Restore capabilities for these web apps, [scale up](../manage-scale-up.md) to Basic tier or higher.|[Bring App Service resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster](../manage-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, App Service applications won't be placed in disaster recovery mode during a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. It's recommended to implement [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) to prevent downtime and data loss during a regional disaster.|
|App Service Web Apps<br>(Basic\Standard\Premium Pricing Tier)|In Azure App Service, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app by restoring to a new app or slot.<br><br>Refer to [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more info.|Current guidance regarding how to bring App Service resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster is available at [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md). <br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, Azure App Service web applications will no longer be placed in disaster recovery mode during a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. We encourage you to implement [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) to prevent loss of functionality or data for your web apps if there's a regional disaster.|
|App Service Environment (V2 & V3)|In Azure App Service Environment, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups. Automatic backups can be restored to a target app within the same ASE, not in another ASE. Custom backups can be restored to a target app in another ASE (such as from a V2 ASE to a V3 ASE). Backups can be restored to target app of the same OS platform as the source app.<br><br>Refer to [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more details.| We encourage you to implement disaster recovery guidance for web apps deployed to App Service Environment using [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md).  |
|Azure Functions (Dedicated)|In Azure Functions, You can make on-demand custom backups or utilize automatic backups. You can restore a backup by overwriting an existing app by restoring to a new app or slot.<br><br>Refer to [Back up and restore your app in Azure App Service](../manage-backup.md) for more info.| Current guidance regarding how to bring Azure Functions app (dedicated) resources back online in a different Azure region during a regional disaster is available at [Recover from region-wide failure - Azure App Service](../manage-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>Starting March 31, 2025, App Service applications won't be placed in disaster recovery mode during a disaster in an Azure region as explained in the [recover from region-wide failure](../manage-disaster-recovery.md) article. Instead, implement [Azure Functions geo-disaster recovery](../../azure-functions/functions-geo-disaster-recovery.md).<br><br>Additionally you may also refer to [commonly used disaster recovery techniques](../overview-disaster-recovery.md) for Azure Functions dedicated.|
|Azure Functions Consumption & Premium|Azure functions deployed to consumption and premium plans don't provide access to custom and automatic backups. Function app's content is in an Azure storage account. Use [Azure Storage redundancy](../../storage/common/storage-redundancy.md) options to ensure your storage account meets its availability and durability targets during an outage.<br><br>If you created your functions by using the editor in the Azure portal, you can also [download your existing function app project as a .zip file](../../azure-functions/deployment-zip-push.md). | We strongly encourage you to implement [Azure Functions geo-disaster recovery and reliability](../../azure-functions/functions-geo-disaster-recovery.md).|
