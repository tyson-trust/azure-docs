# App Service Environment version comparison

App Service Environment has three versions. App Service Environment v3 is the latest version and provides advantages and feature differences over earlier versions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App Service Environment v1 and v2 [will be retired on 31 August 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/app-service-environment-version-1-and-version-2-will-be-retired-on-31-august-2024/). After that date, those versions will no longer be supported and any remaining App Service Environment v1 and v2s and the applications running on them will be deleted.

In addition to the management addresses, App Service Environment v3 dynamically scales the supporting infrastructure, and uses between 4 and 27 addresses, depending on the configuration and load.

### Scaling

App Service Environment v3 runs on the latest [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](../../virtual-machine-scale-sets/overview.md) infrastructure while App Service Environment v1 and v2 run on [Cloud Services (classic)](../../cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me.md). Because of this, App Service Environment v3 has the best performing and fastest scaling times across all versions.

### Pricing

App Service Environment v3 is often cheaper than previous versions due to the removal of the stamp fee and larger instance sizes. For information and example scenarios on how migrating to App Service Environment v3 can affect your costs, see the [migration pricing samples](migrate.md#pricing) and [Estimate your cost savings by migrating to App Service Environment v3](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2023/03/02/App-service-environment-v3-pricing.html).

#### What SKUs are available on App Service Environment v1, v2, and v3?

App Service Environment v1 uses the Premium SKU and App Service Environment v2 use the Isolated SKU. App Service Environment v3 uses Isolated v2. The following tables list the available instances for each SKU with their respective core counts and RAM. The corresponding instances between Isolated v2 and Isolated have double the cores and RAM. This increase in capacity should be reviewed when migrating to App Service Environment v3 from Isolated or Premium to ensure you aren't over-provisioned.

**App Service Environment v3 (Isolated v2)**:

|Isolated v2|Cores    |RAM (GB) |
|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|I1v2       |2        |8        |
|I2v2       |4        |16       |
|I3v2       |8        |32       |
|I4v2       |16       |64       |
|I5v2       |32       |128      |
|I6v2       |64       |256      |

**App Service Environment v2 (Isolated)**:

|Isolated |Cores    |RAM (GB) |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|I1       |1        |3.5      |
|I2       |2        |7        |
|I3       |4        |14       |

**App Service Environment v1 (Premium)**:

|Premium  |Cores    |RAM (GB) |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|P1       |1        |1.75     |
|P2       |2        |3.5      |
|P3       |4        |7        |
|P4       |8        |14       |

#### What does "no networking dependencies on the customer's virtual network" mean?

On App Service Environment v3, you don't need to set inbound and outbound rules for the management and dependency traffic. App Service Environment v3 was designed so that management and dependency traffic stays within the Azure backbone instead of your virtual network. The only traffic that traverses your virtual network is the application traffic to and from your apps.

The minimal requirement for App Service Environment v3 to be operational is:

|Source / Destination Port(s)|Direction|Source|Destination|Purpose|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|* / 80|Inbound|AzureLoadBalancer|App Service Environment subnet range|Allow internal health ping traffic|

For more information on App Service Environment v3 networking dependencies, see [ports and network restrictions](networking.md#ports-and-network-restrictions).

On App Service Environment v2, there are many inbound and outbound requirements that have to you have to manage. Modifying these rules can cause the environment to go into an unhealthy state.

- Inbound
    - TCP from the IP service tag AppServiceManagement on ports 454, 455
    - TCP from the load balancer on port 16001
    - From the App Service Environment subnet to the App Service Environment subnet on all ports
- Outbound
    - UDP to all IPs on port 53
    - UDP to all IPs on port 123
    - TCP to all IPs on port 80, 443
    - TCP to the IPs service tag Sql on ports 1433
    - TCP to all IPs on port 12000
    - To the App Service Environment subnet on all ports 

For more information on App Service Environment v2 networking dependencies, see [inbound and outbound dependencies](network-info.md#inbound-and-outbound-dependencies).

#### Why is backup and restore to a storage account behind a firewall not supported on App Service Environment v3?

This limitation is a result of the underlying infrastructure change that was implemented for App Service Environment v3. Since backup and restore are management operations, and all management traffic is isolated outside of the customer's virtual network, these operations need to take place through the Azure backbone network. Therefore the customer can't explicitly allow this traffic through the firewall on their storage account.

#### What does custom domain suffix refer to?

The custom domain suffix is for the App Service Environment. It's available on App Service Environment v1 and v3, but was removed from App Service Environment v2. 

It's different from a custom domain binding on App Service. The custom domain suffix defines a root domain that can be used by the App Service Environment. In the public variation of Azure App Service, the default root domain for all web apps is azurewebsites.net. For ILB App Service Environments, the default root domain is appserviceenvironment.net. However, since an ILB App Service Environment is internal to a customer's virtual network, customers can use a root domain in addition to the default one that makes sense for use within a company's internal virtual network. For example, a hypothetical Contoso Corporation might use a default root domain of internal-contoso.com for apps that are intended to only be resolvable and accessible within Contoso's virtual network. An app in this virtual network could be reached by accessing APP-NAME.internal-contoso.com.

For more information on custom domain suffix, see [Custom domain suffix for App Service Environments](how-to-custom-domain-suffix.md).

#### What regions are the different versions supported in?

Due to hardware changes between the versions, there are some regions where App Service Environment v1/v2 may be supported, but not App Service Environment v3. The [supported regions list](overview.md#regions) is continuously updated with the latest availabilities.
