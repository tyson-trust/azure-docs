# Provide access to Key Vault keys, certificates, and secrets with an Azure role-based access control

> [!NOTE]
> Key Vault resource provider supports two resource types: **vaults** and **managed HSMs**. Access control described in this article only applies to **vaults**. To learn more about access control for managed HSM, see [Managed HSM access control](../managed-hsm/access-control.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure App Service certificate configuration through Azure Portal does not support Key Vault RBAC permission model. You can use Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, ARM template deployments with **Key Vault Secrets User** and **Key Vault Reader** role assignments for 'Microsoft Azure App Service' global identity.

Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) is an authorization system built on [Azure Resource Manager](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.

Azure RBAC allows users to manage Key, Secrets, and Certificates permissions. It provides one place to manage all permissions across all key vaults.

The Azure RBAC model allows uses to set permissions on different scope levels: management group, subscription, resource group, or individual resources.  Azure RBAC for key vault also allows users to have separate permissions on individual keys, secrets, and certificates

For more information, see [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md).

## Best Practices for individual keys, secrets, and certificates role assignments

Our recommendation is to use a vault per application per environment
(Development, Pre-Production, and Production).

Individual keys, secrets, and certificates permissions should be used
only for specific scenarios:

- Sharing individual secrets between multiple applications, for example, one application needs to access data from the other application

More about Azure Key Vault management guidelines, see:

- [Azure Key Vault best practices](best-practices.md)
- [Azure Key Vault service limits](service-limits.md)

## Azure built-in roles for Key Vault data plane operations

> [!NOTE]
> The `Key Vault Contributor` role is for management plane operations to manage key vaults. It does not allow access to keys, secrets and certificates.

| Built-in role | Description | ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Key Vault Administrator| Perform all data plane operations on a key vault and  all objects in it, including certificates, keys, and secrets. Cannot manage key vault resources or manage role assignments. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | 00482a5a-887f-4fb3-b363-3b7fe8e74483 |
| Key Vault Certificates Officer | Perform any action on the certificates of a key vault, except manage permissions. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | a4417e6f-fecd-4de8-b567-7b0420556985 |
| Key Vault Crypto Officer | Perform any action on the keys of a key vault, except manage permissions. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | 14b46e9e-c2b7-41b4-b07b-48a6ebf60603 |
| Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User | Read metadata of keys and perform wrap/unwrap operations. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | e147488a-f6f5-4113-8e2d-b22465e65bf6 |
| Key Vault Crypto User  | Perform cryptographic operations using keys. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | 12338af0-0e69-4776-bea7-57ae8d297424 |
| Key Vault Reader | Read metadata of key vaults and its certificates, keys, and secrets. Cannot read sensitive values such as secret contents or key material. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | 21090545-7ca7-4776-b22c-e363652d74d2 |
| Key Vault Secrets Officer| Perform any action on the secrets of a key vault, except manage permissions. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | b86a8fe4-44ce-4948-aee5-eccb2c155cd7 |
| Key Vault Secrets User | Read secret contents including secret portion of a certificate with private key. Only works for key vaults that use the 'Azure role-based access control' permission model. | 4633458b-17de-408a-b874-0445c86b69e6 |

> [!NOTE]
> There is no `Key Vault Certificate User` because applications require secrets portion of certificate with private key. The `Key Vault Secrets User` role should be used for applications to retrieve certificate.

For more information about Azure built-in roles definitions, see [Azure built-in roles](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md).

## Using Azure RBAC secret, key, and certificate permissions with Key Vault

The new Azure RBAC permission model for key vault provides alternative to the vault access policy permissions model. 

### Prerequisites

You must have an Azure subscription. If you don't, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

To add role assignments, you must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` and `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/delete` permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner).

### Enable Azure RBAC permissions on Key Vault

> [!NOTE]
> Changing permission model requires 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' permission, which is part of [Owner](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner) and [User Access Administrator](../../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) roles. Classic subscription administrator roles like 'Service Administrator' and 'Co-Administrator' are not supported.

1.  Enable Azure RBAC permissions on new key vault:

    ![Enable Azure RBAC permissions - new vault](../media/rbac/new-vault.png)

2.  Enable Azure RBAC permissions on existing key vault:

    ![Enable Azure RBAC permissions - existing vault](../media/rbac/existing-vault.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Setting Azure RBAC permission model invalidates all access policies permissions. It can cause outages when equivalent Azure roles aren't assigned.

### Assign role

> [!Note]
> It's recommended to use the unique role ID instead of the role name in scripts. Therefore, if a role is renamed, your scripts would continue to work. In this document role name is used only for readability.

Run the following command to create a role assignment:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)
```azurecli
az role assignment create --role <role_name_or_id> --assignee <assignee> --scope <scope>
```

For full details, see [Assign Azure roles using Azure CLI](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-cli.md).

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azurepowershell)

```azurepowershell
#Assign by User Principal Name
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName <role_name> -SignInName <assignee_upn> -Scope <scope>

#Assign by Service Principal ApplicationId
New-AzRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ApplicationId <applicationId> -Scope <scope>
```

For full details, see [Assign Azure roles using Azure PowerShell](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions:

### Can I use Key Vault role-based access control (RBAC) permission model object-scope assignments to provide isolation for application teams within Key Vault?
No. RBAC permission model allows you to assign access to individual objects in Key Vault to user or application, but any administrative operations like network access control, monitoring, and objects management require vault level permissions, which will then expose secure information to operators across application teams.
