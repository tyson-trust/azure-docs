# Route traffic for high availability of applications using Azure CLI

This script creates a resource group, two app service plans, two web apps, a traffic manager profile, and two traffic manager endpoints. Traffic Manager directs traffic to the application in one region as the primary region, and to the secondary region when the application in the primary region is unavailable. Before executing the script, you must change the MyWebApp, MyWebAppL1 and MyWebAppL2 values to unique values across Azure. After running the script, you can access the app in the primary region with the URL mywebapp.trafficmanager.net.

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, web app, traffic manager profile, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az appservice plan create](/cli/azure/appservice/plan) | Creates an App Service plan. This is like a server farm for your Azure web app. |
| [az webapp web create](/cli/azure/webapp#az-webapp-create) | Creates an Azure web app within the App Service plan. |
| [az network traffic-manager profile create](/cli/azure/network/traffic-manager/profile) | Creates an Azure Traffic Manager profile. |
| [az network traffic-manager endpoint create](/cli/azure/network/traffic-manager/endpoint) | Adds an endpoint to an Azure Traffic Manager Profile. |
