The following table shows limits that may be different for basic, standard, premium, and dedicated tiers. 

> [!NOTE]
> - In the table, CU is [capacity unit](../event-hubs-dedicated-overview.md), PU is [processing unit](../event-hubs-scalability.md#processing-units), and TU is [throughput unit](../event-hubs-scalability.md#throughput-units). 
> - You can configure [TUs](../event-hubs-auto-inflate.md#use-azure-portal) for a basic or standard tier namespace or [PUs](../configure-processing-units-premium-namespace.md) for a premium tier namespace. 
> - When you [create a dedicated cluster](../event-hubs-dedicated-cluster-create-portal.md#create-an-event-hubs-dedicated-cluster), 1 CU is assigned to the cluster. If you enable the **Support Scaling** option while creating the cluster, you'll be able to scale out by increasing CUs or scale in by decreasing CUs for the cluster yourself. For step-by-step instructions, see [Scale dedicated cluster](../event-hubs-dedicated-cluster-create-portal.md#scale-a-dedicated-cluster). For clusters that don't support the **Support Scaling** feature, [submit a ticket](../event-hubs-dedicated-cluster-create-portal.md#submit-a-support-request) To adjust CUs for the cluster. 

| Limit | Basic | Standard | Premium |  Dedicated |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | -------- | --------- | 
| Maximum size of Event Hubs publication | 256 KB | 1 MB | 1 MB |  1 MB |
| Number of Event Hub consumer groups per event hub | 1 | 20 | 100 | 1000<br/>No limit per CU  |
| Number of Kafka consumer groups per Namespace | NA | 1000 | 1000 | 1000  |
| Number of brokered connections per namespace | 100 | 5,000 | 10000 per PU<br/><br/>For example, if the namespace is assigned 3 PUs, the limit is 30000. | 100, 000 per CU |
| Maximum retention period of event data | 1 day | 7 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| Maximum TUs or PUs or CUs | 40 TUs | 40 TUs | 16 PUs | 20 CUs |
| Number of partitions per event hub | 32 | 32 | 100 per event hub, but there's a limit of 200 per PU at the namespace level.<br/><br/> For example, if a namespace is assigned 2 PUs, the limit for total number of partitions in all event hubs in the namespace is 2 * 200 = 400. | 1024 per event hub<br/> 2000 per CU |
| Number of namespaces per subscription | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 (50 per CU) |
| Number of event hubs per namespace | 10 | 10 | 100 per PU | 1000 |
| Capture | N/A | Pay per hour | Included | Included |
| Size of compacted event hub  | N/A | 1 GB per partition | 250 GB per partition | 250 GB per partition |
| Size of the schema registry (namespace) in mega bytes | N/A | 25 | 100 | 1024 |
| Number of schema groups in a schema registry or namespace | N/A | 1 - excluding the default group | 100 <br/>1 MB per schema | 1000<br/>1 MB per schema |
| Number of schema versions across all schema groups | N/A | 25 | 1000 | 10000 |
| Throughput per unit | Ingress - 1 MB/s or 1000 events per second<br/>Egress – 2 MB/s or 4096 events per second | Ingress - 1 MB/s or 1000 events per second<br/>Egress – 2 MB/s or 4096 events per second | No limits per PU * | No limits per CU * |

\* Depends on various factors such as resource allocation, number of partitions, storage, and so on. 
 

> [!NOTE]
> You can publish events individually or batched. 
> The publication limit (according to SKU) applies regardless of whether it is a single event or a batch. Publishing events larger than the maximum threshold will be rejected.
