# Allow access to Azure Event Hubs namespaces from specific IP addresses or ranges
By default, Event Hubs namespaces are accessible from internet as long as the request comes with valid authentication and authorization. With IP firewall, you can restrict it further to only a set of IPv4 addresses or IPv4 address ranges in [CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation.

This feature is helpful in scenarios in which Azure Event Hubs should be only accessible from certain well-known sites. Firewall rules enable you to configure rules to accept traffic originating from specific IPv4 addresses. For example, if you use Event Hubs with [Azure Express Route][express-route], you can create a **firewall rule** to allow traffic from only your on-premises infrastructure IP addresses. 

## IP firewall rules
You specify IP firewall rules at the Event Hubs namespace level. So, the rules apply to all connections from clients using any supported protocol. Any connection attempt from an IP address that doesn't match an allowed IP rule on the Event Hubs namespace is rejected as unauthorized. The response doesn't mention the IP rule. IP filter rules are applied in order, and the first rule that matches the IP address determines the accept or reject action.


## Important points
- This feature isn't supported in the **basic** tier.
- Turning on firewall rules for your Event Hubs namespace blocks incoming requests by default, unless requests originate from a service operating from allowed public IP addresses. Requests that are blocked include the requests from other Azure services, from the Azure portal, from logging and metrics services, and so on. As an exception, you can allow access to Event Hubs resources from certain **trusted services** even when the IP filtering is enabled. For a list of trusted services, see [Trusted Microsoft services](#trusted-microsoft-services).
- Specify **at least one IP firewall rule or virtual network rule** for the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network. If there are no IP and virtual network rules, the namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key).  


## Use Azure portal

When creating a namespace, you can either allow public only (from all networks) or private only (only via private endpoints) access to the namespace. Once the namespace is created, you can allow access from specific IP addresses or from specific virtual networks (using network service endpoints). 

### Configure public access when creating a namespace
To enable public access, select **Public access** on the **Networking** page of the namespace creation wizard. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/event-hubs-firewall/create-namespace-public-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Networking page of the Create namespace wizard with Public access option selected.":::

After you create the namespace, select **Networking** on the left menu of the **Event Hubs Namespace** page. You see that **All Networks** option is selected. You can select **Selected Networks** option and allow access from specific IP addresses or specific virtual networks. The next section provides you details on configuring IP firewall to specify the IP addresses from which the access is allowed. 

### Configure IP firewall for an existing namespace
This section shows you how to use the Azure portal to create IP firewall rules for an Event Hubs namespace. 

1. Navigate to your **Event Hubs namespace** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
4. Select **Networking** under **Settings** on the left menu. 
1. On the **Networking** page, for **Public network access**, choose **Selected networks** option to allow access from only specified IP addresses. 

    Here are more details about options available in the **Public network access** page:
    - **Disabled**. This option disables any public access to the namespace. The namespace is accessible only through [private endpoints](private-link-service.md). 
    - **Selected networks**. This option enables public access to the namespace using an access key from selected networks. 

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If you choose **Selected networks**, add at least one IP firewall rule or a virtual network that will have access to the namespace. Choose **Disabled** if you want to restrict all traffic to this namespace over [private endpoints](private-link-service.md) only.
    - **All networks** (default). This option enables public access from all networks using an access key. If you select the **All networks** option, the event hub accepts connections from any IP address (using the access key). This setting is equivalent to a rule that accepts the 0.0.0.0/0 IP address range. 
1. To restrict access to **specific IP addresses**, select **Selected networks** option, and then follow these steps: 
    1. In the **Firewall** section, select **Add your client IP address** option to give your current client IP the access to the namespace. 
    3. For **address range**, enter a specific IPv4 address or a range of IPv4 address in CIDR notation.
        
        To restrict access to **specific virtual networks**, see [Allow access from specific networks](event-hubs-service-endpoints.md). 
    1. Specify whether you want to **allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall**. See [Trusted Microsoft services](#trusted-microsoft-services) for details.

3. Select **Save** on the toolbar to save the settings. Wait for a few minutes for the confirmation to show up on the portal notifications.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To restrict access to specific virtual networks, see [Allow access from specific networks](event-hubs-service-endpoints.md).

## Use Resource Manager template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Firewall feature isn't supported in the basic tier.

The following Resource Manager template enables adding an IP filter rule to an existing Event Hubs namespace.

**ipMask** in the template is a single IPv4 address or a block of IP addresses in CIDR notation. For example, in CIDR notation 70.37.104.0/24 represents the 256 IPv4 addresses from 70.37.104.0 to 70.37.104.255, with 24 indicating the number of significant prefix bits for the range.

> [!NOTE]
> The default value of the `defaultAction` is `Allow`. When adding virtual network or firewalls rules, make sure you set the `defaultAction` to `Deny`.

}
```

To deploy the template, follow the instructions for [Azure Resource Manager][lnk-deploy].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there are no IP and virtual network rules, all the traffic flows into the namespace even if you set the `defaultAction` to `deny`.  The namespace can be accessed over the public internet (using the access key). Specify at least one IP rule or virtual network rule for the namespace to allow traffic only from the specified IP addresses or subnet of a virtual network.  

## Use Azure CLI
Use [`az eventhubs namespace network-rule-set`](/cli/azure/eventhubs/namespace/network-rule-set) add, list, update, and remove commands to manage IP firewall rules for an Event Hubs namespace.

## Use Azure PowerShell
Use the following Azure PowerShell commands to add, list, remove, update, and delete IP firewall rules. 

- [`Add-AzEventHubIPRule`](/powershell/module/az.eventhub/add-azeventhubiprule) to add an IP firewall rule.
- [`New-AzEventHubIPRuleConfig`](/powershell/module/az.eventhub/new-azeventhubipruleconfig) and [`Set-AzEventHubNetworkRuleSet`](/powershell/module/az.eventhub/set-azeventhubnetworkruleset) together to add an IP firewall rule
- [`Remove-AzEventHubIPRule`](/powershell/module/az.eventhub/remove-azeventhubiprule) to remove an IP firewall rule.


## Default action and public network access 

### REST API

The default value of the `defaultAction` property was `Deny` for API version **2021-01-01-preview and earlier**. However, the deny rule isn't enforced unless you set IP filters or virtual network (VNet) rules. That is, if you didn't have any IP filters or VNet rules, it's treated as `Allow`. 

From API version **2021-06-01-preview onwards**, the default value of the `defaultAction` property is `Allow`, to accurately reflect the service-side enforcement. If the default action is set to `Deny`, IP filters and VNet rules are enforced. If the default action is set to `Allow`, IP filters and VNet rules aren't enforced. The service remembers the rules when you turn them off and then back on again. 

The API version **2021-06-01-preview onwards** also introduces a new property named `publicNetworkAccess`. If it's set to `Disabled`, operations are restricted to private links only. If it's set to `Enabled`, operations are allowed over the public internet. 

For more information about these properties, see [Create or Update Network Rule Set](/rest/api/eventhub/preview/namespaces-network-rule-set/create-or-update-network-rule-set) and [Create or Update Private Endpoint Connections](/rest/api/eventhub/preview/private-endpoint-connections/create-or-update).

> [!NOTE]
> None of the above settings bypass validation of claims via SAS or Azure AD authentication. The authentication check always runs after the service validates the network checks that are configured by `defaultAction`, `publicNetworkAccess`, `privateEndpointConnections` settings.

### Azure portal

Azure portal always uses the latest API version to get and set properties.  If you had configured your namespace using **2021-01-01-preview and earlier** with `defaultAction` set to `Deny`, and specified zero IP filters and VNet rules, the portal would have previously checked **Selected Networks** on the **Networking** page of your namespace. Now, it checks the **All networks** option.
