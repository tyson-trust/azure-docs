# Copy data from Google AdWords using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]


This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Google AdWords. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Google AdWords connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities|IR |
|---------| --------|
|[Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-)|&#9312; &#9313;|
|[Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md)|&#9312; &#9313;|

<small>*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*</small>

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources/sinks, see the [Supported data stores](connector-overview.md#supported-data-stores) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Getting started

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-v2-connector-get-started](includes/data-factory-v2-connector-get-started.md)]

## Create a linked service to Google AdWords using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Google AdWords in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.":::

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    :::image type="content" source="media/doc-common-process/new-linked-service-synapse.png" alt-text="Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.":::

2. Search for Google and select the Google AdWords connector.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Google AdWords connector.

## Linked service properties

> [!Important]
> Due to the sunset of Google AdWords API by **April 27, 2022**, the service has upgraded to the new Google Ads API. Please refer this [document](connector-troubleshoot-google-adwords.md#migrate-to-the-new-version-of-google-ads-api) for detailed migration steps and recommendations. Please make sure the migration to be done before **April 27, 2022**.
