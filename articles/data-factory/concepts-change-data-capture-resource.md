# Change data capture resource overview
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-xxx-md](includes/appliesto-adf-xxx-md.md)]

Adapting to the cloud-first big data world can be incredibly challenging for data engineers who are responsible for building complex data integration and ETL pipelines. 

Azure Data Factory is introducing a new mechanism to make the life of a data engineer easier. 

By automatically detecting data changes at the source without requiring complex designing or coding, ADF is making it a breeze to scale these processes. Change Data Capture will now exist as a **new native top-level resource** in the Azure Data Factory studio where data engineers can quickly configure continuously running jobs to process big data at scale with extreme efficiency. 

The new Change Data Capture resource in ADF allows for full fidelity change data capture that continuously runs in near real-time through a guided configuration experience.
