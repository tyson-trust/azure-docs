# Troubleshoot the Oracle connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article provides suggestions to troubleshoot common problems with the Oracle connector in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse.

## Oracle

### Error code: ArgumentOutOfRangeException

- **Message**: `Hour, Minute, and Second parameters describe an un-representable DateTime.`

- **Cause**: In Azure Data Factory and Synapse pipelines, DateTime values are supported in the range from 0001-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59. However, Oracle supports a wider range of DateTime values, such as the BC century or min/sec>59, which leads to failure.

- **Recommendation**: 

    To see whether the value in Oracle is in the supported range of dates, run `select dump(<column name>)`. 

    To learn the byte sequence in the result, see [How are dates stored in Oracle?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13568193/how-are-dates-stored-in-oracle).
