# Start or stop your Azure Spring Apps service instance

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

This article shows you how to start or stop your Azure Spring Apps service instance.

> [!NOTE]
> You can stop and start your Azure Spring Apps service instance to help you save costs, but you shouldn't stop and start a running instance for service recovery.

Your applications running in Azure Spring Apps may not need to run continuously. For example, an application may not need to run continuously if you have a service instance that's used only during business hours. There may be times when Azure Spring Apps is idle and running only the system components.

You can reduce the active footprint of Azure Spring Apps by reducing the running instances and ensuring costs for compute resources are reduced.

To reduce your costs further, you can completely stop your Azure Spring Apps service instance. All user apps and system components will be stopped. However, all your objects and network settings will be saved so you can restart your service instance and pick up right where you left off.

> [!NOTE]
> The state of a stopped Azure Spring Apps service instance is preserved for up to 90 days. If your cluster is stopped for more than 90 days, you can't recover the cluster state.

You can only start, view, or delete a stopped Azure Spring Apps service instance. You must start your service instance before performing any update operation, such as creating or scaling an app.

## Prerequisites

- An existing service instance in Azure Spring Apps. To create a new service instance, see [Quickstart: Provision an Azure Spring Apps service instance](./quickstart-provision-service-instance.md).
- (Optional) [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.45.0 or later.

## [Portal](#tab/azure-portal)

## Stop a running instance

In the Azure portal, use the following steps to stop a running Azure Spring Apps instance:

1. Go to the Azure Spring Apps service overview page.

1. Select **Stop** to stop a running instance.

1. After the instance stops, the status will show **Succeeded (Stopped)**.

## Start a stopped instance

In the Azure portal, use the following steps to start a stopped Azure Spring Apps instance:

1. Go to Azure Spring Apps service overview page.

1. Select **Start** to start a stopped instance.

1. After the instance starts, the status will show **Succeeded (Running)**.

## [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

## Stop a running instance

With the Azure CLI, use the following command to stop a running Azure Spring Apps instance:

```azurecli
az spring stop \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

## Start a stopped instance

With the Azure CLI, use the following command to start a stopped Azure Spring Apps instance:

```azurecli
az spring start \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

## Check the power state

After the instance stops or starts, use the following command to check the power state:

```azurecli
az spring show \
    --name <service-instance-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```
