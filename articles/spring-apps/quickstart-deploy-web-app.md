# Quickstart: Deploy your first web application to Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> The first 50 vCPU hours and 100 GB hours of memory are free each month. For more information, see [Price Reduction - Azure Spring Apps does more, costs less!](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/price-reduction-azure-spring-apps-does-more-costs-less/ba-p/3614058) on the [Apps on Azure Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/bg-p/AppsonAzureBlog).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

This quickstart shows how to deploy a Spring Boot web application to Azure Spring Apps. The sample project is a simple ToDo application to add tasks, mark when they're complete, and then delete them. The following screenshot shows the application:

:::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/todo-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a sample web application in Azure Spring Apps." lightbox="./media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/todo-app.png":::

This application is a typical three-layers web application with the following layers:

- A frontend bounded [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
- A backend Spring web application that uses Spring Data JPA to access a relational database.
- A relational database. For localhost, the application uses [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html). For Azure Spring Apps, the application uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL. For more information about Azure Database for PostgreSQL, see [Flexible Server documentation](../postgresql/flexible-server/overview.md).

The following diagram shows the architecture of the system:

This article provides the following options for deploying to Azure Spring Apps:

- Azure portal - This is a more conventional way to create resources and deploy applications step by step. This approach is suitable for Spring developers who are using Azure cloud services for the first time.
- Azure Developer CLI: This is a more efficient way to automatically create resources and deploy applications through simple commands, and it covers application code and infrastructure as code files needed to provision the Azure resources. This approach is suitable for Spring developers who are familiar with Azure cloud services.

## 1. Prerequisites

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

### [Azure portal](#tab/Azure-portal)

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.

### [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/Azure-Developer-CLI)

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install), version 1.0.

::: zone pivot="sc-consumption-plan,sc-enterprise"

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.45.0 or higher. Use the following command to install the Azure Spring Apps extension: `az extension add --name spring`

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

- If you're deploying an Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan instance for the first time in the target subscription, see the [Requirements](./how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer.md#requirements) section of [Enterprise plan in Azure Marketplace](./how-to-enterprise-marketplace-offer.md).

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-azure-spring-apps-standard-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-standard-plan.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-azure-spring-apps-enterprise-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-enterprise-plan.md)]

[!INCLUDE [deploy-to-azure-spring-apps-consumption-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/deploy-consumption-plan.md)]

## 5. Validate the web app

Now you can access the deployed app to see whether it works. Use the following steps to validate:

::: zone pivot="sc-consumption-plan"

1. After the deployment has completed, use the following command to access the app with the URL retrieved:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app show \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
       --name ${APP_NAME} \
       --query properties.url \
       --output tsv
   ```

   The page should appear as you saw in localhost.

1. Use the following command to check the app's log to investigate any deployment issue:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app logs \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
       --name ${APP_NAME}
   ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise"

1. After the deployment has completed, you can access the app with this URL: `https://${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME}-${APP_NAME}.azuremicroservices.io/`. The page should appear as you saw in localhost.

1. Use the following command to check the app's log to investigate any deployment issue:

   ```azurecli
   az spring app logs \
       --service ${AZURE_SPRING_APPS_NAME} \
       --name ${APP_NAME}
   ```

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

1. Access the application with the output application URL. The page should appear as you saw in localhost.

1. From the navigation pane of the Azure Spring Apps instance overview page, select **Logs** to check the app's logs.

   :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/logs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the Azure Spring Apps logs page." lightbox="media/quickstart-deploy-web-app/logs.png":::

::: zone-end

## 6. Clean up resources

::: zone pivot="sc-standard"

[!INCLUDE [clean-up-resources-portal-or-azd](includes/quickstart-deploy-web-app/clean-up-resources.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="sc-enterprise, sc-consumption-plan"

If you plan to continue working with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you might want to leave these resources in place. When you no longer need the resources, delete them by deleting the resource group. Use the following command to delete the resource group:

```azurecli
az group delete --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP}
```

::: zone-end
