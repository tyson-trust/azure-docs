# Quickstart: Deploy microservice applications to Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> The first 50 vCPU hours and 100 GB hours of memory are free each month. For more information, see [Price Reduction - Azure Spring Apps does more, costs less!](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/price-reduction-azure-spring-apps-does-more-costs-less/ba-p/3614058) on the [Apps on Azure Blog](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/bg-p/AppsonAzureBlog).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

This article explains how to deploy microservice applications to Azure Spring Apps using the well-known sample app [PetClinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices). The Pet Clinic sample demonstrates the microservice architecture pattern. The following diagram shows the architecture of the PetClinic application on Azure Spring Apps.

The diagram shows the following architectural flows and relationships of the Pet Clinic sample:

- Uses Azure Spring Apps to manage the Spring Boot apps. Each app uses HSQLDB as the persistent store.
- Uses the managed components Spring Cloud Config Server and Eureka Service Discovery on Azure Spring Apps. The Config Server reads Git repository configuration.
- Exposes the URL of API Gateway to load balance requests to service apps, and exposes the URL of the Admin Server to manage the applications.
- Analyzes logs using the Log Analytics workspace.
- Monitors performance with Application Insights.

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses a simplified version of PetClinic, using an in-memory database that is not production-ready to quickly deploy to Azure Spring Apps.
> 
> The deployed app `admin-server` exposes public access, which is a risk point. The production environment needs to secure the Spring Boot Admin application.

## 1. Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](/java/azure/jdk/), version 17.
- [Docker Desktop or Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

[!INCLUDE [deploy-microservice-apps-with-basic-standard-plan](includes/quickstart-deploy-microservice-apps/deploy-microservice-apps-with-basic-standard-plan.md)]

## 5. Validate the apps

The following sections describe how to validate the deployment.

### 5.1. Access the applications

Using the URL information in the deployment log output, open the URL exposed by the app named `api-gateway` - for example, `https://<your-Azure-Spring-Apps-instance-name>-api-gateway.azuremicroservices.io`. The application should look similar to the following screenshot:

### 5.2. Query the application logs

After you browse each function of the Pet Clinic, the Log Analytics workspace collects logs of each application. You can check the logs by using custom queries, as shown in the following screenshot:

### 5.3. Monitor the applications

Application Insights monitors the application dependencies, as shown by the following application tracing map:

Open the URL exposed by the app `admin-server` to manage the applications through the Spring Boot Admin Server, as shown in the following screenshot:
