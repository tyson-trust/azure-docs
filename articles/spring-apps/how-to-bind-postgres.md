# Bind an Azure Database for PostgreSQL to your application in Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Java ❌ C#

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

With Azure Spring Apps, you can bind select Azure services to your applications automatically, instead of having to configure your Spring Boot application manually. This article shows you how to bind your application to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance.

In this article, we include two authentication methods: Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and PostgreSQL authentication. The Passwordless tab shows the Azure AD authentication and the Password tab shows the PostgreSQL authentication.

Azure AD authentication is a mechanism for connecting to Azure Database for PostgreSQL using identities defined in Azure AD. With Azure AD authentication, you can manage database user identities and other Microsoft services in a central location, which simplifies permission management.

PostgreSQL authentication uses accounts stored in PostgreSQL. If you choose to use passwords as credentials for the accounts, these credentials are stored in the user table. Because these passwords are stored in PostgreSQL, you need to manage the rotation of the passwords by yourself.

## Prerequisites

* An application deployed to Azure Spring Apps. For more information, see [Quickstart: Deploy your first application to Azure Spring Apps](./quickstart.md).
* An Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server instance.
* [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) version 2.45.0 or higher.

## Prepare your Java project

Use the following steps to prepare your project.

1. In your project's *pom.xml* file, add the following dependency:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-jdbc-postgresql</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

1. In the *application.properties* file, remove any `spring.datasource.*` properties.

1. Update the current app by running `az spring app deploy`, or create a new deployment for this change by running `az spring app deployment create`.

## Bind your app to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to select only one of the following approaches to create a connection. If you've already created tables with one connection, other users can't access or modify the tables. When you try the other approach, the application will throw errors such as "Permission denied". To fix this issue, connect to a new database or delete and recreate an existing one.

### [Passwordless (Recommended)](#tab/Passwordlessflex)

1. Install the [Service Connector](../service-connector/overview.md) passwordless extension for the Azure CLI:

   ```azurecli
   az extension add --name serviceconnector-passwordless --upgrade
   ```

1. Configure Azure Spring Apps to connect to the PostgreSQL Database with a system-assigned managed identity using the `az spring connection create` command.

   ```azurecli
   az spring connection create postgres-flexible \
       --resource-group $AZ_SPRING_APPS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --service $AZ_SPRING_APPS_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME \
       --app $APP_NAME \
       --deployment $DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
       --target-resource-group $POSTGRES_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --server $POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME \
       --database $DATABASE_NAME \
       --system-identity
   ```

### [Password](#tab/Secretsflex)

Use the following steps to bind your app using a secret.

1. Note the admin username and password of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL account.

1. Connect to the server, create a database named **testdb** from a PostgreSQL client, and then create a new non-admin account.

1. Run the following command to connect to the database with admin username and password.

   ```azurecli
   az spring connection create postgres-flexible \
       --resource-group $AZ_SPRING_APPS_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --service $AZ_SPRING_APPS_SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME \
       --app $APP_NAME \
       --deployment $DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
       --target-resource-group $POSTGRES_RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --server $POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME \
       --database $DATABASE_NAME \
       --secret name=$USERNAME secret=$PASSWORD
   ```
