For clarity of structure, a separate markdown file is used to describe how to clean up resources using Azure Portal or AZD.

## 6. Clean up resources

You can delete the Azure resource group, which includes all the resources in the resource group. Use the following steps to delete the entire resource group, including the newly created service:

1. Locate your resource group in the Azure portal. On the home page, under **Azure services** select **Resource groups** and then select the name of your resource group, such as the example, **myresourcegroup**.

1. On your **Resource group** page, select **Delete resource group**. Enter the name of your resource group in the text box to confirm deletion. Select **Delete**.
