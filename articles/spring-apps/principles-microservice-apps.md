# Java and Base OS for Azure Spring Apps apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Java

The following are principles for maintaining healthy Java and base operating system for Azure Spring Apps apps.

## Principles for healthy Java and Base OS

* Shall be the same base operating system across plans - Basic | Standard | Premium.

  * Currently, apps on Azure Spring Apps use a mix of Debian 10 and Ubuntu 18.04.
  * VMware Tanzu® Build Service™ uses Ubuntu 18.04.

* Shall be the same base operating system regardless of deployment starting points - source | JAR

  * Currently, apps on Azure Spring Apps use a mix of Debian 10 and Ubuntu 18.04.

* Base operating system shall be free of security vulnerabilities.

  * Debian 10 base operating system has 147 open CVEs.
  * Ubuntu 18.04 base operating system has 132 open CVEs.

* Shall use JRE-headless.

  * Currently, apps on Azure Spring Apps use JDK. JRE-headless is a smaller image.

* Shall use the most recent builds of Java.

  * Currently, apps on Azure Spring Apps use Java 8 build 242. This is an outdated build.

Azul Systems will continuously scan for changes to base operating systems and keep the last built images up to date. Azure Spring Apps looks for changes to images and continuously updates them across deployments.

## FAQ for Azure Spring Apps

* Which versions of Java are supported? Major version and build number.

  * Support LTS versions - Java 8 and 11.
  * Uses the most recent build - for example, right now, Java 8 build 252 and Java 11 build 7.
