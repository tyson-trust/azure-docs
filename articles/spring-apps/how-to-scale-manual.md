# Scale an application in Azure Spring Apps

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Java ✔️ C#

**This article applies to:** ✔️ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

This article demonstrates how to scale a Spring application using Azure Spring Apps in the Azure portal.

You can scale your app up and down by modifying its number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) and amount of memory. Scale your app in and out by modifying the number of application instances.

After you finish, you'll know how to make quick manual changes to each application in your service. Scaling takes effect within seconds and doesn't require any code changes or redeployment.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
* A deployed Azure Spring Apps service instance. For more information, see [Quickstart: Deploy your first application to Azure Spring Apps](./quickstart.md) to get started.
* At least one application already created in your service instance.

## Navigate to the Scale page in the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to your Azure Spring Apps instance.

1. Select **Apps** under **Settings** in the navigation pane.

1. Select the app you want to scale and then select **Scale up** in the navigation pane. Specify the **vCPU** and **Memory** settings using the guidelines as described in the following section.

1. Select **Scale out** in the navigation pane. Specify the **instance  count** setting as described in the following section.

## Scale your application

As you modify the scaling attributes, keep the following notes in mind:

* **vCPU**: The maximum number of CPUs per application instance is four. The total number of CPUs for an application is the value set here multiplied by the number of application instances.

* **Memory**: The maximum amount of memory per application instance is 8 GB. The total amount of memory for an application is the value set here multiplied by the number of application instances.

* **instance count**: In the Standard plan, you can scale out to a maximum of 20 instances. This value changes the number of separate running instances of the Spring application.

Be sure to select **Save** to apply your scaling settings.

After a few seconds, the scaling changes you make are reflected on the **Overview** page of the app. Select **App instance** in the navigation pane for details about the instance of the app.

## Upgrade to the Standard plan

If you're on the Basic plan and constrained by current limits, you can upgrade to the Standard plan. For more information, see [Quotas and service plans for Azure Spring Apps](./quotas.md) and [Migrate an Azure Spring Apps Basic or Standard plan instance to the Enterprise plan](how-to-migrate-standard-tier-to-enterprise-tier.md).
