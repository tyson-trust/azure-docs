## Add IP configuration

The Azure CNI plugin allocates IP addresses to containers based on a pool of IP addresses you create on the virtual network interface of the virtual machine. For every container on the host, an IP configuration must exist on the virtual network interface. If the number of containers on the server outnumber the IP configurations on the virtual network interface, the container will start but won't have an IP address. 

In this section, you'll add an IP configuration to the virtual network interface of the virtual machine you created previously.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

2. Select **myVM**.

3. In **Settings**, select **Networking**.

4. Select the name of the network interface next to **Network Interface:**. The network interface is named **myvm** with a random number. In this example, it's **myvm418**.

18. Select **OK**.

The Bastion connection will drop for a few seconds as the network configuration is applied. Wait a few seconds then attempt to reconnect. Continue when a reconnection is successful.

## Install Docker

The Docker container engine must be installed and configured on the virtual machine you created previously.

Sign-in to the virtual machine you created previously with the Azure Bastion host you deployed with the virtual network.

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

2. Select **myVM**.

3. In the **Overview** of **myVM**, select **Connect** then **Bastion**.

4. Enter the username and password you created when you deployed the virtual machine in the previous steps.

5. Select **Connect**.

6. Open **Windows PowerShell** on **myVM**.

7. The following example installs **Docker CE/Moby**:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-DockerCE/install-docker-ce.ps1" -o install-docker-ce.ps1

    .\install-docker-ce.ps1
    ```

The virtual machine will reboot to install the container support in Windows. Reconnect to the virtual machine and the Docker install will continue.

For more information about Windows containers, see, [Get started: Prep Windows for containers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=dockerce#windows-server-1).

After Docker is installed on your virtual machine, continue with the steps in this article.

## Install CNI plugin and jq

The Azure CNI plugin is maintained as a GitHub project and is available for download from the project's GitHub page. For this article, you'll download the CNI plugin repository within the virtual machine and then install and configure the plugin.

For more information about the Azure CNI plugin, see [Microsoft Azure Container Networking](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

2. Select **myVM**.

3. In the **Overview** of **myVM**, select **Connect** then **Bastion**.

4. Enter the username and password you created when you deployed the virtual machine in the previous steps.

5. Select **Connect**.

6. Use the following example to download and extract the CNI plugin to a temporary folder in the virtual machine:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -OutFile azure-container-networking.zip
    
    Expand-Archive azure-container-networking.zip -DestinationPath azure-container-networking
    ```

7. To install the CNI plugin, change to the scripts directory of the CNI plugin folder you downloaded in the previous step.  The install script command requires a version number for the CNI plugin. At the time of the writing of this article, the newest version is **`v1.4.39`**. To obtain the latest version number of the plugin or previous versions, see [Releases](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/releases).

    ```powershell
    cd .\azure-container-networking\azure-container-networking-master\scripts\

    .\Install-CniPlugin.ps1 v1.4.39
    ```

8. The CNI plugin comes with a built-in network configuration file for the plugin. Use the following example to copy the file to the network configuration directory:

    ```powershell
    Copy-Item -Path "c:\k\azurecni\bin\10-azure.conflist" -Destination "c:\k\azurecni\netconf"
    ```

### Install jq

The script that creates the containers with the Azure CNI plugin requires the application jq. For more information and download location, see [Download jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

1. Open a web browser in the virtual machine and download the **jq** application.

2. The download is a self-contained executable for the application. Copy the executable **`jq-win64.exe`** to the **`C:\Windows`** directory.

## Create test container

1. To start a container with the CNI plugin, you must use a special script that comes with the plugin to create and start the container. The following example will create a Windows Server container with the CNI plugin script:

    ```powershell
    cd .\azure-container-networking\azure-container-networking-master\scripts\
    .\docker-exec.ps1 vnetdocker1 default mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis add
    ```

    It can take a few minutes for the image for the container to download for the first time. When the container starts and initializes the network, the Bastion connection will disconnect. Wait a few seconds and the connection will reestablish.

2. To verify that the container received the IP address you previously configured, connect to the container and view the IP:

    ```powershell
    docker exec -it vnetdocker1 powershell
    ```

3. Use the **`ipconfig`** command in the following example to verify the IP address was assigned to the container:

    ```powershell
    ipconfig
    ```
    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-container-networking-docker-windows/ipconfig-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of ipconfig output in PowerShell prompt of test container.":::

4. Exit the container and close the Bastion connection to **myVM**.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this application, delete the virtual network and virtual machine with the following steps:

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Resource group**. Select **Resource groups** in the search results.

2. Select **myResourceGroup**.

3. In the **Overview** of **myResourceGroup**, select **Delete resource group**.

4. In **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:**, enter **myResourceGroup**.

5. Select **Delete**.
