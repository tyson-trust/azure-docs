# Public IP addresses

>[!Important]
>On September 30, 2025, Basic SKU public IPs will be retired. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/upgrade-to-standard-sku-public-ip-addresses-in-azure-by-30-september-2025-basic-sku-will-be-retired/). If you are currently using Basic SKU public IPs, make sure to upgrade to Standard SKU public IPs prior to the retirement date. For guidance on upgrading, visit [Upgrading a basic public IP address to Standard SKU - Guidance](public-ip-basic-upgrade-guidance.md).

Public IP addresses allow Internet resources to communicate inbound to Azure resources. Public IP addresses enable Azure resources to communicate to Internet and public-facing Azure services. You dedicate the address to the resource until you unassign it. A resource without a public IP assigned can communicate outbound. Azure dynamically assigns an available IP address that isn't dedicated to the resource. For more information about outbound connections in Azure, see [Understand outbound connections](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

In Azure Resource Manager, a [public IP](virtual-network-public-ip-address.md) address is a resource that has its own properties. 

The following resources can be associated with a public IP address:

* Virtual machine network interfaces

* Virtual Machine Scale Sets

* Public Load Balancers

* Virtual Network Gateways (VPN/ER)

* NAT gateways

* Application Gateways

* Azure Firewalls

* Bastion Hosts

* Route Servers

* Api Management

For Virtual Machine Scale Sets, use [Public IP Prefixes](public-ip-address-prefix.md).

## At-a-glance

The following table shows the property a public IP can be associated to a resource and the allocation methods. Public IPv6 support isn't available for all resource types at this time.

| Top-level resource | IP Address association | Dynamic IPv4 | Static IPv4 | Dynamic IPv6 | Static IPv6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Virtual machine |Network interface |Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Public Load balancer |Front-end configuration |Yes | Yes | Yes |Yes |
| Virtual Network gateway (VPN) |Gateway IP configuration |Yes (non-AZ only) |Yes | No |No |
| Virtual Network gateway (ER) |Gateway IP configuration |Yes | Yes | Yes (preview) |No |
| NAT gateway |Gateway IP configuration |No |Yes | No |No |
| Application Gateway |Front-end configuration |Yes (V1 only) |Yes (V2 only) | No | No |
| Azure Firewall | Front-end configuration | No | Yes | No | No |
| Bastion Host | Public IP configuration | No | Yes | No | No |
| Route Server | Front-end configuration | No | Yes | No | No |
| Api Management | Front-end configuration | No | Yes | No | No |

## IP address version

Public IP addresses can be created with an IPv4 or IPv6 address. You may be given the option to create a dual-stack deployment with a IPv4 and IPv6 address.

## SKU

Public IP addresses are created with one of the following SKUs:

| Public IP address | Standard  | Basic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allocation method| Static | For IPv4: Dynamic or Static; For IPv6: Dynamic.| 
| Idle Timeout | Have an adjustable inbound originated flow idle timeout of 4-30 minutes, with a default of 4 minutes, and fixed outbound originated flow idle timeout of 4 minutes.|Have an adjustable inbound originated flow idle timeout of 4-30 minutes, with a default of 4 minutes, and fixed outbound originated flow idle timeout of 4 minutes.|
| Security | Secure by default model and be closed to inbound traffic when used as a frontend.  Allow traffic with [network security group](../../virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview.md#network-security-groups) (NSG) is required (for example, on the NIC of a virtual machine with a Standard SKU Public IP attached).| Open by default.  Network security groups are recommended but optional for restricting inbound or outbound traffic.| 
| [Availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) | Supported. Standard IPs can be nonzonal, zonal, or zone-redundant. **Zone redundant IPs can only be created in [regions where 3 availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-region.md) are live.** IPs created before availability zones aren't zone redundant. | Not supported. | 
| [Routing preference](routing-preference-overview.md)| Supported to enable more granular control of how traffic is routed between Azure and the Internet. | Not supported.| 
| Global tier | Supported via [cross-region load balancers](../../load-balancer/cross-region-overview.md).| Not supported. |

> [!NOTE]
> Basic SKU IPv4 addresses can be upgraded after creation to Standard SKU.  To learn about SKU upgrade, refer to [Public IP upgrade](public-ip-upgrade-portal.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Matching SKUs are required for load balancer and public IP resources. You can't have a mixture of basic SKU resources and standard SKU resources. You can't attach standalone virtual machines, virtual machines in an availability set resource, or a virtual machine scale set resources to both SKUs simultaneously.  New designs should consider using Standard SKU resources. For more information about a standard load balancer, see [Standard Load Balancer](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).

## IP address assignment

Public IPs have two types of assignments:

- **Static** - The resource is assigned an IP address at the time it's created. The IP address is released when the resource is deleted. 

- **Dynamic** - The IP address **isn't** given to the resource at the time of creation when selecting dynamic.  The IP is assigned when you associate the public IP address with a resource. The IP address is released when you stop, or delete the resource.

**Static public IP addresses** are commonly used in the following scenarios:

* When you must update firewall rules to communicate with your Azure resources.

* DNS name resolution, where a change in IP address would require updating A records.

* Your Azure resources communicate with other apps or services that use an IP address-based security model.

* You use TLS/SSL certificates linked to an IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> Even when you set the allocation method to **static**, you cannot specify the actual IP address assigned to the public IP address resource. Azure assigns the IP address from a pool of available IP addresses in the Azure location the resource is created in.

**Basic public IP addresses** are commonly used for when there's no dependency on the IP address. 

For example, a public IP resource is released from a resource named **Resource A**. **Resource A** receives a different IP on start-up if the public IP resource is reassigned. Any associated IP address is released if the allocation method is changed from **static** to **dynamic**. Any associated IP address is unchanged if the allocation method is changed from **dynamic** to **static**. Set the allocation method to **static** to ensure the IP address remains the same.

| Resource | Static  | Dynamic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard public IPv4 | :white_check_mark: | x |
| Standard public IPv6 | :white_check_mark: | x |
| Basic public IPv4 | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| Basic public IPv6 | x | :white_check_mark: |

## DNS Name Label

Select this option to specify a DNS label for a public IP resource. This functionality works for both IPv4 addresses (32-bit A records) and IPv6 addresses (128-bit AAAA records). This selection creates a mapping for **domainnamelabel**.**location**.cloudapp.azure.com to the public IP in the Azure-managed DNS. 

For instance, creation of a public IP with the following settings:

* **contoso** as a **domainnamelabel**

* **West US** Azure **location**

The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) **contoso.westus.cloudapp.azure.com** resolves to the public IP address of the resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each domain name label created must be unique within its Azure location.  

If a custom domain is desired for services that use a public IP, you can use [Azure DNS](../../dns/dns-custom-domain.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#public-ip-address) or an external DNS provider for your DNS Record.

## Availability Zone

Public IP addresses with a standard SKU can be created as nonzonal, zonal, or zone-redundant in [regions that support availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-region.md). 

A zone-redundant IP is created in all zones for a region and can survive any single zone failure. A zonal IP is tied to a specific availability zone, and shares fate with the health of the zone. A "nonzonal" public IP addresses are placed into a zone for you by Azure and doesn't give a guarantee of redundancy.

In regions without availability zones, all public IP addresses are created as nonzonal. Public IP addresses created in a region that is later upgraded to have availability zones remain nonzonal.  A public IP's availability zone can't be changed after the public IP's creation.

> [!NOTE]
> All basic SKU public IP addresses are created as non-zonal.  Any IP that is upgraded from a basic SKU to standard SKU remains non-zonal.

## Other public IP address features

There are other attributes that can be used for a public IP address.  

* The Global **Tier** allows a public IP address to be used with cross-region load balancers. 

* The Internet **Routing Preference** option minimizes the time that traffic spends on the Microsoft network, lowering the egress data transfer cost.

> [!NOTE]
> At this time, both the **Tier** and **Routing Preference** feature are available for standard SKU IPv4 addresses only. They can't be utilized on the same IP address concurrently.

## Limits 

The limits for IP addressing are listed in the full set of [limits for networking](../../azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#networking-limits) in Azure. The limits are per region and per subscription. 

[Contact support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to increase above the default limits based on your business needs.

## Pricing

Public IPv4 addresses have a nominal charge; Public IPv6 addresses have no charge.

To learn more about IP address pricing in Azure, review the [IP address pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses) page.

## Limitations for IPv6

* VPN gateways can't be used in a virtual network with IPv6 enabled, either directly or peered with "UseRemoteGateway".

* Azure doesn't support IPv6 communication for containers.

* Use of IPv6-only virtual machines or virtual machines scale sets aren't supported. Each NIC must include at least one IPv4 IP configuration (dual-stack).

* IPv6 ranges can't be added to a virtual network with existing resource navigation links when adding IPv6 to existing IPv4 deployments.

* Forward DNS for IPv6 is supported for Azure public DNS. Reverse DNS isn't supported.

* Routing Preference Internet isn't supported.
