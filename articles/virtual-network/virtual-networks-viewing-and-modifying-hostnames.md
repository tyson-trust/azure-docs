# View and modify hostnames

The hostname identifies your virtual machine (VM) in the user interface and Azure operations. You first assign the hostname of a VM in the **Virtual machine name** field during the creation process in the Azure portal. After you create a VM, you can view and modify the hostname either through a remote connection or in the Azure portal.

## View hostnames
You can view the hostname of your VM in a cloud service by using any of the following tools.

### Azure portal

In the Azure portal, go to your VM, and select **Properties** from the left navigation. On the **Properties** page, you can view the hostname under **Computer Name**.

### Remote Desktop
You can connect to your VM using a remote desktop tool like Remote Desktop (Windows), Windows PowerShell remoting (Windows), SSH (Linux and Windows) or Bastion (Azure portal). You can then view the hostname in a few ways:

* Type *hostname* in PowerShell, the command prompt, or SSH terminal.
* Type *ipconfig /all* in the command prompt (Windows only).
* View the computer name in the system settings (Windows only).

### Azure API
From a REST client, follow these instructions:

1. Ensure that you have an authenticated connection to the Azure portal. Follow the steps presented in [Create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). 
2. Send a request in the following format:

    ```http
    GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}?api-version=2022-11-01`. 
    ```

    For more information on GET requests for virtual machines, see [Virtual Machines - Get](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/get).
3. Look for the **osProfile** and then the **computerName** element to find the host name.

> [!WARNING]
> You can also view the internal domain suffix for your cloud service by running `ipconfig /all` from a command prompt in a remote desktop session (Windows), or by running `cat /etc/resolv.conf` from an SSH terminal (Linux).

## Modify a hostname
You can modify the hostname for any VM by renaming the computer from a remote desktop session or by using **Run command** in the Azure portal.

From a remote session:
* For Windows, you can change the hostname from PowerShell by using the [Rename-Computer](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/rename-computer) command. 
* For Linux, you can change the hostname by using `hostnamectl`.

You can also use run these commands to find the hostname for your VM from the Azure portal by using **Run command**. In the Azure portal, go to your VM, and select **Run command** from the left navigation. From the **Run command** page in the Azure portal:
* For Windows, select **RunPowerShellScript** and use `Rename-Computer` in the **Run Command Script** pane.
* For Linux, select **RunShellScript** and use `hostnamectl` in the **Run Command Script** pane.

The following image shows the **Run command** page in the Azure portal for a Windows VM.

After you run either `Rename-Computer` or `hostnamectl` on your VM, you need to restart your VM for the hostname to change.

## Azure classic deployment model

The Azure classic deployment model uses a configuration file that you can download and upload to change the host name. To allow your host name to reference your role instances, you must set the value for the host name in the service configuration file for each role. You do that by adding the desired host name to the **vmName** attribute of the **Role** element. The value of the **vmName** attribute is used as a base for the host name of each role instance. 

For example, if **vmName** is *webrole* and there are three instances of that role, the host names of the instances are *webrole0*, *webrole1*, and *webrole2*. You don't need to specify a host name for virtual machines in the configuration file, because the host name for a VM is populated based on the virtual machine name. For more information about configuring a Microsoft Azure service, see [Azure Service Configuration Schema (.cscfg File)](/previous-versions/azure/reference/ee758710(v=azure.100))

### Service configuration file
In  the Azure classic deployment model, you can download the service configuration file for a deployed service from the **Configure** pane of the service in the Azure portal. You can then look for the **vmName** attribute for the **Role name** element to see the host name. Keep in mind that this host name is used as a base for the host name of each role instance. For example, if **vmName** is *webrole* and there are three instances of that role, the host names of the instances are *webrole0*, *webrole1*, and *webrole2*.
