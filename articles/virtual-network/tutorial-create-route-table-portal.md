# Tutorial: Route network traffic with a route table using the Azure portal

Azure routes traffic between all subnets within a virtual network, by default. You can create your own routes to override Azure's default routing. Custom routes are helpful when, for example, you want to route traffic between subnets through a network virtual appliance (NVA).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a virtual network and subnets
> * Create an NVA that routes traffic
> * Deploy virtual machines (VMs) into different subnets
> * Create a route table
> * Create a route
> * Associate a route table to a subnet
> * Route traffic from one subnet to another through an NVA

This tutorial uses the Azure portal. You can also complete it using the [Azure CLI](tutorial-create-route-table-cli.md) or [PowerShell](tutorial-create-route-table-powershell.md).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

### Allow ICMP in Windows firewall

1. Select **Go to resource** or Search for *myVMPrivate* in the portal search box.

1. In the **Overview** page of **myVMPrivate**, select **Connect** then **Bastion**.

1. Enter the username and password you created for **myVMPrivate** virtual machine previously.

1. Select **Connect** button.

1. Open Windows PowerShell after you connect.

1. Enter this command:

    ```powershell
    New-NetFirewallRule –DisplayName "Allow ICMPv4-In" –Protocol ICMPv4
    ```

1. From PowerShell, open a remote desktop connection to the **myVMPublic** virtual machine:

    ```powershell
    mstsc /v:myvmpublic
    ```

1. After you connect to **myVMPublic** VM, open Windows PowerShell and enter the same command from step 6.

1. Close the remote desktop connection to **myVMPublic** VM.

## Turn on IP forwarding

To route traffic through the NVA, turn on IP forwarding in Azure and in the operating system of **myVMNVA** virtual machine. Once IP forwarding is enabled, any traffic received by **myVMNVA** VM that's destined for a different IP address, won't be dropped and will be forwarded to the correct destination.

### Turn on IP forwarding in Azure

In this section, you'll turn on IP forwarding for the network interface of **myVMNVA** virtual machine in Azure.

1. Search for *myVMNVA* in the portal search box.

3. In the **myVMNVA** overview page, select **Networking** from the **Settings** section.

4. In the **Networking** page of **myVMNVA**, select the network interface next to **Network Interface:**.  The name of the interface will begin with **myvmnva**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/virtual-machine-networking.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Networking page of network virtual appliance virtual machine in Azure portal." border="true":::

5. In the network interface overview page, select **IP configurations** from the **Settings** section.

6. In the **IP configurations** page, set **IP forwarding** to **Enabled**, then select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/enable-ip-forwarding.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Enabled I P forwarding in Azure portal." border="true":::

### Turn on IP forwarding in the operating system

In this section, you'll turn on IP forwarding for the operating system of **myVMNVA** virtual machine to forward network traffic. You'll use the same bastion connection to **myVMPrivate** VM, that you started in the previous steps, to open a remote desktop connection to **myVMNVA** VM.

1. From PowerShell on **myVMPrivate** VM, open a remote desktop connection to the **myVMNVA** VM:

    ```powershell
    mstsc /v:myvmnva
    ```

2. After you connect to **myVMNVA** VM, open Windows PowerShell and enter this command to turn on IP forwarding:

    ```powershell
    Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters -Name IpEnableRouter -Value 1
    ```

3. Restart **myVMNVA** VM.

    ```powershell
    Restart-Computer
    ```

## Create a route table

In this section, you'll create a route table.

1. From the Azure portal menu, select **+ Create a resource** > **Networking** > **Route table**, or search for *Route table* in the portal search box.

3. Select **Create**.

4. On the **Basics** tab of **Create route table**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription.|
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | **Instance details** |    |
    | Region | Select **East US**. |
    | Name | Enter *myRouteTablePublic*. |
    | Propagate gateway routes | Select **Yes**. |

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/create-route-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Basics tab of Create route table in Azure portal." border="true":::

5. Select the **Review + create** tab, or select the blue **Review + create** button at the bottom of the page.

## Create a route

In this section, you'll create a route in the route table that you created in the previous steps.

1. Select **Go to resource** or Search for *myRouteTablePublic* in the portal search box.

3. In the **myRouteTablePublic** page, select **Routes** from the **Settings** section.

4. In the **Routes** page, select the **+ Add** button.

5. In **Add route**, enter or select this information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Route name | Enter *ToPrivateSubnet*. |
    | Address prefix destination | Select **IP Addresses**. |
    | Destination IP addresses/CIDR ranges| Enter *10.0.1.0/24* (The address range of the **Private** subnet created earlier). |
    | Next hop type | Select **Virtual appliance**. |
    | Next hop address | Enter *10.0.2.4* (The address of **myVMNVA** VM created earlier in the **DMZ** subnet). |

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/add-route-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Add route configuration in Azure portal." lightbox="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/add-route-expanded.png":::

6. Select **Add**.

## Associate a route table to a subnet

In this section, you'll associate the route table that you created in the previous steps to a subnet.

1. Search for *myVirtualNetwork* in the portal search box.

3. In the **myVirtualNetwork** page, select **Subnets** from the **Settings** section.

4. In the virtual network's subnet list, select **Public**.

5. In **Route table**, select **myRouteTablePublic** that you created in the previous steps. 

6. Select **Save** to associate your route table to the **Public** subnet.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/associate-route-table-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Associate route table to the Public subnet in the virtual network in Azure portal." lightbox="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/associate-route-table-expanded.png":::

## Test the routing of network traffic

You'll test routing of network traffic using [tracert](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/tracert) tool from **myVMPublic** VM to **myVMPrivate** VM, and then you'll test the routing in the opposite direction.

### Test network traffic from myVMPublic VM to myVMPrivate VM

1. From PowerShell on **myVMPrivate** VM, open a remote desktop connection to the **myVMPublic** VM:

    ```powershell
    mstsc /v:myvmpublic
    ```

2. After you connect to **myVMPublic** VM, open Windows PowerShell and enter this *tracert* command to trace the routing of network traffic from **myVMPublic** VM to **myVMPrivate** VM:


    ```powershell
    tracert myvmprivate
    ```

    The response is similar to this example:

    ```powershell
    Tracing route to myvmprivate.q04q2hv50taerlrtdyjz5nza1f.bx.internal.cloudapp.net [10.0.1.4]
    over a maximum of 30 hops:

      1     1 ms     *        2 ms  myvmnva.internal.cloudapp.net [10.0.2.4]
      2     2 ms     1 ms     1 ms  myvmprivate.internal.cloudapp.net [10.0.1.4]

    Trace complete.
    ```
    
    You can see that there are two hops in the above response for *tracert* ICMP traffic from **myVMPublic** VM to **myVMPrivate** VM. The first hop is **myVMNVA** VM, and the second hop is the destination **myVMPrivate** VM.

    Azure sent the traffic from **Public** subnet through the NVA and not directly to **Private** subnet because you previously added **ToPrivateSubnet** route to **myRouteTablePublic** route table and associated it to **Public** subnet.

1. Close the remote desktop connection to **myVMPublic** VM.

### Test network traffic from myVMPrivate VM to myVMPublic VM

1. From PowerShell on **myVMPrivate** VM, and enter this *tracert* command to trace the routing of network traffic from **myVmPrivate** VM to **myVmPublic** VM.

    ```powershell
    tracert myvmpublic
    ```

    The response is similar to this example:

    ```powershell
    Tracing route to myvmpublic.q04q2hv50taerlrtdyjz5nza1f.bx.internal.cloudapp.net [10.0.0.4]
    over a maximum of 30 hops:

      1     1 ms     1 ms     1 ms  myvmpublic.internal.cloudapp.net [10.0.0.4]

    Trace complete.
    ```

    You can see that there's one hop in the above response, which is the destination **myVMPublic** virtual machine.

    Azure sent the traffic directly from **Private** subnet to **Public** subnet. By default, Azure routes traffic directly between subnets.

1. Close the bastion session.

## Clean up resources

When the resource group is no longer needed, delete **myResourceGroup** and all the resources it contains:

1. Enter *myResourceGroup* in the **Search** box at the top of the Azure portal. When you see **myResourceGroup** in the search results, select it.

1. Select **Delete resource group**.

1. Enter *myResourceGroup* for **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME:** and select **Delete**. 

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you:

* Created a route table and associated it to a subnet.
* Created a simple NVA that routed traffic from a public subnet to a private subnet. 

You can deploy different pre-configured NVAs from the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/networking), which provide many useful network functions.
