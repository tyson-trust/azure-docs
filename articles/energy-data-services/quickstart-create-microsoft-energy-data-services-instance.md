# Quickstart: Create an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance

Get started by creating an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance on Azure portal on a web browser. You first register an Azure application on Active Directory and then use the application ID to create an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance in your chosen Azure Subscription and region. 

The setup of Azure Data Manager fgigior Energy instance can be triggered using a simple interface on Azure portal and takes about 50 minutes to complete.

Azure Data Manager for Energy is a managed "Platform as a service (PaaS)" offering from Microsoft that builds on top of the [OSDU&trade;](https://osduforum.org/) Data Platform. Azure Data Manager for Energy lets you ingest, transform, and export subsurface data by letting you connect your consuming in-house or third-party applications. 

## Prerequisites

| Prerequisite | Details |
| ------------ | ------- |
Active Azure Subscription | You need the Azure subscription ID in which you want to install Azure Data Manager for Energy. You need to have appropriate permissions to create Azure resources in this subscription. 
Application ID | You need an [application ID](../active-directory/develop/application-model.md) (often referred to as "App ID" or a "client ID"). This application ID is used for authentication to Azure Active Directory and will be associated with your Azure Data Manager for Energy instance. You can [create an application ID](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md) by navigating to Active directory and selecting *App registrations* > *New registration*.
Client Secret | Sometimes called an application password, a client secret is a string value that your app can use in place of a certificate to identity itself. You can [create a client secret](../active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app.md#add-a-client-secret) by selecting *Certificates & secrets* > *Client secrets* > *New client secret*. Record the secret's value for use in your client application code. This secret value is never displayed again after you leave this page.


## Create an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance


1. Save your **Application (client) ID** and **client secret** from Azure Active Directory to refer to them later in this quickstart.  

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/MarketplaceOffersBlade/selectedMenuItemId/home)


1. If you have access to multiple tenants, use the *Directories + subscriptions* filter in the top menu to switch to the tenant in which you want to install Azure Data Manager for Energy.

1. Use the search bar in the Azure Marketplace (not the global Azure search bar on top of the screen) to search for *Azure Data Manager for Energy*.

    [![Screenshot of the search result on Azure Marketplace that shows Azure Data Manager for Energy. Azure Data Manager for Energy shows as a card.](media/quickstart-create-microsoft-energy-data-services-instance/search-meds-on-azure-marketplace.png)](media/quickstart-create-microsoft-energy-data-services-instance/search-meds-on-azure-marketplace.png#lightbox)

1. In the search page, select *Create* on the card titled "Azure Data Manager for Energy". 


1. A new window appears. Complete the *Basics* tab by choosing the *subscription*, *resource group*, *tier*, and the *region* in which you want to create your instance of Azure Data Manager for Energy. Enter the *App ID* that you created during the prerequisite steps. The default tier is currently the *Standard* tier. You can use the drop down to change your tier selection.

    [![Screenshot of the basic details page after you select Create for Azure Data Manager for Energy. This page allows you to enter both instance and data partition details.](media/quickstart-create-microsoft-energy-data-services-instance/input-basic-details-sku.png)](media/quickstart-create-microsoft-energy-data-services-instance/input-basic-details-sku.png#lightbox)

 

    Some naming conventions to guide you at this step:

    | Field | Name Validation | 
    | ----- | --------------- |
    Instance name | Only alphanumeric characters are allowed, and the value must be 1-15 characters long. The name is **not** case-sensitive. One resource group can't have two instances with the same name. 
    Application ID | Enter the valid Application ID that you generated and saved in the last section.
    Data Partition name | Name should be 1-10 char long consisting of lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens. It should start with an alphanumeric character and not contain consecutive hyphens. The data partition names that you chose are automatically prefixed with your Azure Data Manager for Energy instance name. This compound name will be used to refer to your data partition in application and API calls. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure Data Manager for Energy instance and data partition names, once created, cannot be changed later.  

1. Move to the next tab, *Networking*, and configure as needed. Learn more about [setting up a Private Endpoint in Azure Data Manager for Energy](../energy-data-services/how-to-set-up-private-links.md)

## Delete an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance

Deleting a Microsoft Energy Data instance also deletes any data that you've ingested. This action is permanent and the ingested data can't be recovered. To delete an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal and delete the *resource group* in which these components are installed.

2. This step is optional. Go to Azure Active Directory and delete the *app registration* that you linked to your Azure Data Manager for Energy instance.

Any set locks at the resource group (RG) level must be removed before deleting any resource in the RG. Resources not deleted due to locks are considered active until the resource is successfully deleted.
