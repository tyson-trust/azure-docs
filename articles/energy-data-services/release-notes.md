## June 2023

### Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Data Manager for Energy
Starting July 2023, Azure Data Manager for Energy offers an uptime SLA for its Standard tier offering. You can find the details of our SLA in the document 'Service Level Agreements for Microsoft Online Services (WW)'  published from July 2023 onwards at [Microsoft Licensing Documents & Resource website](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1).

### Developer tier for accelerating innovation with OSDU&trade;
Azure Data Manager for Energy is now available in two tiers; Developer and Standard.  All active resources of Azure Data Manager for Energy prior to this release are considered Standard, and now a new Tier option is available called, the 'Developer' tier.  Customers can now select their desired tier when creating their Azure Data Manage for Energy resource, using the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/adme-create). [Learn more](./quickstart-create-microsoft-energy-data-services-instance.md)

### Compliant with M16 OSDU&trade; release
Azure Data Manager for Energy is now compliant with the M16 OSDU&trade; milestone release. With this release, you can take advantage of the latest features and capabilities available in the [OSDU&trade; M16](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/governance/project-management-committee/-/wikis/M16-Release-Notes).

### Disaster recovery: cross-region failover
Azure Data Manager for Energy (Standard tier only) now supports cross-region disaster recovery in a multi-region geography (data residency boundary). The service replicates your critical data (in near real time) and infrastructure across another Azure region within the same geography, ensuring data redundancy and enabling swift failover to a secondary region in the event of an outage. [Learn more](./reliability-energy-data-services.md).

### Support for file uploads greater than 5 GB up to 10 GB
Azure Data Manager for Energy now supports uploading dataset files greater than 5 GB using Azcopy. [Learn more](./how-to-upload-large-files-using-file-service.md)

### Partition names without resource name prefix
July 2023 onwards, all data partitions created in your Azure Data Manager for Energy resource discontinues having the resource name as a prefix. For example, if your resource is called `myadmeresource` and you create a data partition called `mydata`, the partition name/ID will be `mydata`, while previously it used to be `myadmeresource-mydata`. This change won't affect existing data partitions.

## May 2023

### Enriched Airflow Logs

Airflow logs from your Azure Data Manager for Energy Preview resource now include extra fields: Dag Name, Dag Task Name, Run ID or Correlation ID, Code Path, TryNumber, Content, Location, Log Severity Level, and Resource ID. These fields can be utilized in the KQL query editor of your linked Log Analytics Workspace to get more specific logs for your executed workflows/DAGs.

### Monitoring and investigating actions with Audit logs

Knowing who is taking what action on which item is critical in helping organizations meet regulatory compliance and record management requirements. Azure Data Manager for Energy captures audit logs for data plane APIs of OSDU services and audit events listed [here](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/documentation/-/wikis/Releases/R3.0/GCP/GCP-Operation/Logging/Audit-Logging-Status). Learn more about [audit logging in Azure Data Manager for Energy](how-to-manage-audit-logs.md).

### Availability Zone support

Availability Zones are physically separate locations within an Azure region made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. Availability Zones provide in-region High Availability and protection against local disasters. Azure Data Manager for Energy supports zone-redundant instance by default and there's no setup required by the customer.

## December 2022

### Support for Lockbox

Most operations such as support and troubleshooting, performed by Microsoft personnel don't require access to customer data. In those rare circumstances where such access is required, Customer Lockbox for Azure Data Manager for Energy provides you with an interface to review, approve or reject data access requests. Azure Data Manager for Energy now supports Lockbox. [Learn more](../security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview.md).


<hr width=100%>

## October 2022

### Support for Private Links

Azure Private Link on Azure Data Manager for Energy provides private access to the service. With Azure Private Link, traffic between your private network and Azure Data Manager for Energy travels over the Microsoft backbone network, therefore limiting any exposure over the internet. By using Azure Private Link, you can connect to an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance from your virtual network via a private endpoint. You can limit access to your Azure Data Manager for Energy instance over these private IP addresses. [Create a private endpoint for Azure Data Manager for Energy](how-to-set-up-private-links.md).

### Encryption at rest using Customer Managed keys

Azure Data Manager for Energy supports customer managed encryption keys (CMK). All data in Azure Data Manager for Energy is encrypted with Microsoft-managed keys by default. In addition to Microsoft-managed key, you can use your own encryption key to protect the data in Azure Data Manager for Energy. When you specify a customer-managed key, that key is used to protect and control access to the Microsoft-managed key that encrypts your data.

## September 2022

### Key Announcement: Release

Azure Data Manager for Energy is now available in. Information on latest releases, bug fixes, & deprecated functionality for Azure Data Manager for Energy will be updated monthly.

Azure Data Manager for Energy is developed in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU&trade; technical standard, version 1.0. and is currently aligned with Mercury Release(R3), [Milestone-12](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/governance/project-management-committee/-/wikis/M12-Release-Notes).

### Partition & User Management

- New data partitions can be [created after provisioning an Azure Data Manager for Energy instance](how-to-add-more-data-partitions.md). Earlier, data partitions could only be created when provisioning a new instance.
- The domain name for entitlement groups for [user management](how-to-manage-users.md) has been changed to "dataservices.energy".

### Data Ingestion

- Azure Data Manager for Energy supports user context in ingestion ([ADR: Issue 52](https://community.opengroup.org/osdu/platform/data-flow/ingestion/home/-/issues/52)) 
  - User identity is preserved and passed on to all ingestion workflow related services using the newly introduced _x-on-behalf-of_ header. You need to have appropriate service level entitlements on all dependent services involved in the ingestion workflow to modify data.
- Workflow service payload is restricted to a maximum of 2 MB. If it exceeds, the service throws an HTTP 413 error. This restriction is placed to prevent workflow requests from overwhelming the server.
- Azure Data Manager for Energy uses Azure Data Factory (ADF) to run large scale ingestion workloads.

### Search

Azure Data Manager for Energy is more secure as Elasticsearch images are now pulled from Microsoft's internal Azure Container Registry instead of public repositories. In addition, Elastic search, registration, and notification services are now encrypted in transit further enhancing the security of the product.

### Monitoring

Azure Data Manager for Energy supports diagnostic settings for [Airflow logs](how-to-integrate-airflow-logs-with-azure-monitor.md) and [Elasticsearch logs](how-to-integrate-elastic-logs-with-azure-monitor.md). You can configure Azure Monitor to view these logs in the storage location of your choice.

### Region Availability

Currently, Azure Data Manager for Energy is available in the following regions - South Central US, East US, West Europe, and North Europe.
