# How to set the cookie policy for the Immersive Reader

The Immersive Reader will disable cookie usage by default. If you enable cookie usage, then the Immersive Reader may use cookies to maintain user preferences and track feature usage. If you enable cookie usage in the Immersive Reader, please consider the requirements of EU Cookie Compliance Policy. It is the responsibility of the host application to obtain any necessary user consent in accordance with EU Cookie Compliance Policy.

The cookie policy can be set through the Immersive Reader [options](../reference.md#options).

## Enable Cookie Usage

```javascript
var options = {
    'cookiePolicy': ImmersiveReader.CookiePolicy.Enable
};

ImmersiveReader.launchAsync(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_SUBDOMAIN, YOUR_DATA, options);
```

## Disable Cookie Usage

```javascript
var options = {
    'cookiePolicy': ImmersiveReader.CookiePolicy.Disable
};

ImmersiveReader.launchAsync(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_SUBDOMAIN, YOUR_DATA, options);
```
