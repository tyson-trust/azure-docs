# Do image retrieval using vectorization (version 4.0 preview)

The Image Retrieval APIs enable the _vectorization_ of images and text queries. They convert images to coordinates in a multi-dimensional vector space. Then, incoming text queries can also be converted to vectors, and images can be matched to the text based on semantic closeness. This allows the user to search a set of images using text, without the need to use image tags or other metadata. Semantic closeness often produces better results in search.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These APIs are only available in the following geographic regions: East US, France Central, Korea Central, North Europe, Southeast Asia, West Europe, West US.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Vision resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Be sure to create it in one of the permitted geographic regions: East US, France Central, Korea Central, North Europe, Southeast Asia, West Europe, West US. 
   * After it deploys, select **Go to resource**. Copy the key and endpoint to a temporary location to use later on.

## Try out Image Retrieval

You can try out the Image Retrieval feature quickly and easily in your browser using Vision Studio.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Vision Studio experience is limited to 500 images. To use a larger image set, create your own search application using the APIs in this guide.

## Call the Vectorize Image API

The `retrieval:vectorizeImage` API lets you convert an image's data to a vector. To call it, make the following changes to the cURL command below:

1. Replace `<endpoint>` with your Azure AI Vision endpoint.
1. Replace `<subscription-key>` with your Azure AI Vision key.
1. In the request body, set `"url"` to the URL of a remote image you want to use.

```bash
curl.exe -v -X POST "https://<endpoint>/computervision/retrieval:vectorizeImage?api-version=2023-02-01-preview&modelVersion=latest" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription-key>" --data-ascii "
{
'url':'https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/media/quickstarts/presentation.png'
}"
```

To vectorize a local image, you'd put the binary image data in the HTTP request body.

The API call returns an **vector** JSON object, which defines the image's coordinates in the high-dimensional vector space.

```json
{ 
  "modelVersion": "2022-04-11", 
  "vector": [ -0.09442752, -0.00067171326, -0.010985051, ... ] 
}
``` 

## Call the Vectorize Text API

The `retrieval:vectorizeText` API lets you convert a text string to a vector. To call it, make the following changes to the cURL command below:

1. Replace `<endpoint>` with your Azure AI Vision endpoint.
1. Replace `<subscription-key>` with your Azure AI Vision key.
1. In the request body, set `"text"` to the example search term you want to use.

```bash
curl.exe -v -X POST "https://<endpoint>/computervision/retrieval:vectorizeText?api-version=2023-02-01-preview&modelVersion=latest" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <subscription-key>" --data-ascii "
{
'text':'cat jumping'
}"
```

The API call returns an **vector** JSON object, which defines the text string's coordinates in the high-dimensional vector space.

```json
{ 
  "modelVersion": "2022-04-11", 
  "vector": [ -0.09442752, -0.00067171326, -0.010985051, ... ] 
}
```

## Calculate vector similarity

Cosine similarity is a method for measuring the similarity of two vectors. In an Image Retrieval scenario, you'll compare the search query vector with each image's vector. Images that are above a certain threshold of similarity can then be returned as search results.

The following example C# code calculates the cosine similarity between two vectors. It's up to you to decide what similarity threshold to use for returning images as search results.

```csharp
public static float GetCosineSimilarity(float[] vector1, float[] vector2)
{ 
    float dotProduct = 0; 
    int length = Math.Min(vector1.Length, vector2.Length); 
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) 
    { 
        dotProduct += vector1[i] * vector2[i]; 
    } 
    float magnitude1 = Math.Sqrt(vector1.Select(x => x * x).Sum());
    float magnitude2 = Math.Sqrt(vector2.Select(x => x * x).Sum());
    
    return dotProduct / (magnitude1 * magnitude2);
}
```
