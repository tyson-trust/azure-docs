### Image Analysis 4.0 Product Recognition (public preview)

The Product Recognition APIs let you analyze photos of shelves in a retail store. You can detect the presence and absence of products and get their bounding box coordinates. Use it in combination with model customization to train a model to identify your specific products. You can also compare Product Recognition results to your store's planogram document. [Product Recognition](./concept-shelf-analysis.md).

## April 2023

### Face limited access tokens

Independent software vendors (ISVs) can manage the Face API usage of their clients by issuing access tokens that grant access to Face features which are normally gated. This allows client companies to use the Face API without having to go through the formal approval process. [Use limited access tokens](how-to/identity-access-token.md).

## March 2023

### Azure AI Vision Image Analysis 4.0 SDK public preview

The [Florence foundation model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/projectflorence/) is now integrated into Azure AI Vision. The improved Vision Services enable developers to create market-ready, responsible Azure AI Vision applications across various industries. Customers can now seamlessly digitize, analyze, and connect their data to natural language interactions, unlocking powerful insights from their image and video content to support accessibility, drive acquisition through SEO, protect users from harmful content, enhance security, and improve incident response times. For more information, see [Announcing Microsoft's Florence foundation model](https://aka.ms/florencemodel).

### Image Analysis 4.0 SDK (public preview)

Image Analysis 4.0 is now available through client library SDKs in C#, C++, and Python. This update also includes the Florence-powered image captioning and dense captioning at human parity performance.

### Image Analysis V4.0 Captioning and Dense Captioning (public preview):

"Caption" replaces "Describe" in V4.0 as the significantly improved image captioning feature rich with details and semantic understanding. Dense Captions provides more detail by generating one sentence descriptions of up to 10 regions of the image in addition to describing the whole image. Dense Captions also returns bounding box coordinates of the described image regions. There's also a new gender-neutral parameter to allow customers to choose whether to enable probabilistic gender inference for alt-text and Seeing AI applications. Automatically deliver rich captions, accessible alt-text, SEO optimization, and intelligent photo curation to support digital content. [Image captions](./concept-describe-images-40.md).

### Video summary and frame locator (public preview): 
Search and interact with video content in the same intuitive way you think and write. Locate relevant content without the need for additional metadata. Available only in [Vision Studio](https://aka.ms/VisionStudio).


### Image Analysis 4.0 model customization (public preview)

You can now create and train your own [custom image classification and object detection models](./concept-model-customization.md), using Vision Studio or the v4.0 REST APIs.

### Image Retrieval APIs (public preview)

The [Image Retrieval APIs](./how-to/image-retrieval.md), part of the Image Analysis 4.0 API, enable the _vectorization_ of images and text queries. They let you convert images and text to coordinates in a multi-dimensional vector space. You can now search with natural language and find relevant images using vector similarity search.

### Background removal APIs (public preview)

As part of the Image Analysis 4.0 API, the [Background removal API](./concept-background-removal.md) lets you remove the background of an image. This operation can either output an image of the detected foreground object with a transparent background, or a grayscale alpha matte image showing the opacity of the detected foreground object.

### Azure AI Vision 3.0 & 3.1 previews deprecation

The preview versions of the Azure AI Vision 3.0 and 3.1 APIs are scheduled to be retired on September 30, 2023. Customers won't be able to make any calls to these APIs past this date.

### Responsible AI for Face

#### Face transparency documentation
* The [transparency documentation](https://aka.ms/faceraidocs) provides guidance to assist our customers to improve the accuracy and fairness of their systems by incorporating meaningful human review to detect and resolve cases of misidentification or other failures, providing support to people who believe their results were incorrect, and identifying and addressing fluctuations in accuracy due to variations in operational conditions.

#### Retirement of sensitive attributes

* We have retired facial analysis capabilities that purport to infer emotional states and identity attributes, such as gender, age, smile, facial hair, hair and makeup. 
* Facial detection capabilities, (including detecting blur, exposure, glasses, headpose, landmarks, noise, occlusion, facial bounding box) will remain generally available and do not require an application.

#### Fairlearn package and Microsoft's Fairness Dashboard

* [The open-source Fairlearn package and Microsoftâ€™s Fairness Dashboard](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox/tree/main/notebooks/cognitive-services-examples/face-verification) aims to support customers to measure the fairness of Microsoft's facial verification algorithms on their own data, allowing them to identify and address potential fairness issues that could affect different demographic groups before they deploy their technology.

#### Limited Access policy

* As a part of aligning Face to the updated Responsible AI Standard, a new [Limited Access policy](https://aka.ms/AAh91ff) has been implemented for the Face API and Azure AI Vision. Existing customers have one year to apply and receive approval for continued access to the facial recognition services based on their provided use cases. See details on Limited Access for Face [here](/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/limited-access-identity?context=/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/context/context) and for Azure AI Vision [here](/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/limited-access?context=/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/context/context).

### New Quality Attribute in Detection_01 and Detection_03
* To help system builders and their customers capture high quality images which are necessary for high quality outputs from Face API, weâ€™re introducing a new quality attribute **QualityForRecognition** to help decide whether an image is of sufficient quality to attempt face recognition. The value is an informal rating of low, medium, or high. The new attribute is only available when using any combinations of detection models `detection_01` or `detection_03`, and recognition models `recognition_03` or `recognition_04`. Only "high" quality images are recommended for person enrollment and quality above "medium" is recommended for identification scenarios. To learn more about the new quality attribute, see [Face detection and attributes](concept-face-detection.md) and see how to use it with [QuickStart](./quickstarts-sdk/identity-client-library.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=visual-studio).

## July 2021

### New HeadPose and Landmarks improvements for Detection_03

* The Detection_03 model has been updated to support facial landmarks.
* The landmarks feature in Detection_03 is much more precise, especially in the eyeball landmarks which are crucial for gaze tracking.

## May 2021

### Spatial Analysis container update

A new version of the [Spatial Analysis container](spatial-analysis-container.md) has been released with a new feature set. This Docker container lets you analyze real-time streaming video to understand spatial relationships between people and their movement through physical environments.

* [Spatial Analysis operations](spatial-analysis-operations.md) can be now configured to detect the orientation that a person is facing.
  * An orientation classifier can be enabled for the `personcrossingline` and `personcrossingpolygon` operations by configuring the `enable_orientation` parameter. It is set to off by default.

* [Spatial Analysis operations](spatial-analysis-operations.md) now also offers configuration to detect a person's speed while walking/running
  * Speed can be detected for the `personcrossingline` and `personcrossingpolygon` operations by turning on the `enable_speed` classifier, which is off by default. The output is reflected in the `speed`, `avgSpeed`, and `minSpeed` outputs.

## April 2021

### Azure AI Vision v3.2 GA

The Azure AI Vision API v3.2 is now generally available with the following updates:

* Improved image tagging model: analyzes visual content and generates relevant tags based on objects, actions, and content displayed in the image. This model is available through the [Tag Image API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-2/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499f200). See the Image Analysis [how-to guide](./how-to/call-analyze-image.md) and [overview](./overview-image-analysis.md) to learn more.
* Updated content moderation model: detects presence of adult content and provides flags to filter images containing adult, racy, and gory visual content. This model is available through the [Analyze API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-2/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499f21b). See the Image Analysis [how-to guide](./how-to/call-analyze-image.md) and [overview](./overview-image-analysis.md) to learn more.
* [OCR (Read) available for 73 languages](./language-support.md#optical-character-recognition-ocr) including Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Latin languages.
* [OCR (Read)](./overview-ocr.md) also available as a [Distroless container](./computer-vision-how-to-install-containers.md?tabs=version-3-2) for on-premises deployment.

> [See Azure AI Vision v3.2 GA](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-2/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005)

### PersonDirectory data structure (preview)

* In order to perform face recognition operations such as Identify and Find Similar, Face API customers need to create an assorted list of **Person** objects. The new **PersonDirectory** is a data structure that contains unique IDs, optional name strings, and optional user metadata strings for each **Person** identity added to the directory. Currently, the Face API offers the **LargePersonGroup** structure which has similar functionality but is limited to 1 million identities. The **PersonDirectory** structure can scale up to 75 million identities.
* Another major difference between **PersonDirectory** and previous data structures is that you'll no longer need to make any Train calls after adding faces to a **Person** object&mdash;the update process happens automatically. For more details see [Use the PersonDirectory structure](how-to/use-persondirectory.md).

## March 2021

### Azure AI Vision 3.2 Public Preview update

> [Use the Read API v3.2 Public Preview](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/computer-vision-v3-2/operations/5d986960601faab4bf452005)


### New Face API detection model
* The new Detection 03 model is the most accurate detection model currently available. If you're a new customer, we recommend using this model. Detection 03 improves both recall and precision on smaller faces found within images (64x64 pixels). Additional improvements include an overall reduction in false positives and improved detection on rotated face orientations. Combining Detection 03 with the new Recognition 04 model will provide improved recognition accuracy as well. See [Specify a face detection model](./how-to/specify-detection-model.md) for more details.
### New detectable Face attributes
* The `faceMask` attribute is available with the latest Detection 03 model, along with the additional attribute `"noseAndMouthCovered"` which detects whether the face mask is worn as intended, covering both the nose and mouth. To use the latest mask detection capability, users need to specify the detection model in the API request: assign the model version with the _detectionModel_ parameter to `detection_03`. See [Specify a face detection model](./how-to/specify-detection-model.md) for more details.
### New Face API Recognition Model
* The new Recognition 04 model is the most accurate recognition model currently available. If you're a new customer, we recommend using this model for verification and identification. It improves upon the accuracy of Recognition 03, including improved recognition for users wearing face covers (surgical masks, N95 masks, cloth masks). Note that we recommend against enrolling images of users wearing face covers as this will lower recognition quality. Now customers can build safe and seamless user experiences that detect whether a user is wearing a face cover with the latest Detection 03 model, and recognize them with the latest Recognition 04 model. See [Specify a face recognition model](./how-to/specify-recognition-model.md) for more details.

## January 2021

### Spatial Analysis container update

A new version of the [Spatial Analysis container](spatial-analysis-container.md) has been released with a new feature set. This Docker container lets you analyze real-time streaming video to understand spatial relationships between people and their movement through physical environments.

* [Spatial Analysis operations](spatial-analysis-operations.md) can be now configured to detect if a person is wearing a protective face covering such as a mask.
  * A mask classifier can be enabled for the `personcount`, `personcrossingline` and `personcrossingpolygon` operations by configuring the `ENABLE_FACE_MASK_CLASSIFIER` parameter.
  * The attributes `face_mask` and `face_noMask` will be returned as metadata with confidence score for each person detected in the video stream
* The *personcrossingpolygon* operation has been extended to allow the calculation of the dwell time a person spends in a zone. You can set the `type` parameter in the Zone configuration for the operation to `zonedwelltime` and a new event of type *personZoneDwellTimeEvent* will include the `durationMs` field populated with the number of milliseconds that the person spent in the zone.
* **Breaking change**: The *personZoneEvent* event has been renamed to *personZoneEnterExitEvent*. This event is raised by the *personcrossingpolygon* operation when a person enters or exits the zone and provides directional info with the numbered side of the zone that was crossed.
* Video URL can be provided as "Private Parameter/obfuscated" in all operations. Obfuscation is optional now and it will only work if `KEY` and `IV` are provided as environment variables.
* Calibration is enabled by default for all operations. Set the `do_calibration: false` to disable it.
* Added support for auto recalibration (by default disabled) via the `enable_recalibration` parameter, please refer to [Spatial Analysis operations](./spatial-analysis-operations.md) for details
* Camera calibration parameters to the `DETECTOR_NODE_CONFIG`. Refer to [Spatial Analysis operations](./spatial-analysis-operations.md) for details.

### Mitigate latency
* The Face team published a new article detailing potential causes of latency when using the service and possible mitigation strategies. See [Mitigate latency when using the Face service](./how-to/mitigate-latency.md).

## December 2020
### Customer configuration for Face ID storage
* While the Face Service does not store customer images, the extracted face feature(s) will be stored on server. The Face ID is an identifier of the face feature and will be used in [Face - Identify](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395239), [Face - Verify](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f3039523a), and [Face - Find Similar](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395237). The stored face features will expire and be deleted 24 hours after the original detection call. Customers can now determine the length of time these Face IDs are cached. The maximum value is still up to 24 hours, but a minimum value of 60 seconds can now be set. The new time ranges for Face IDs being cached is any value between 60 seconds and 24 hours. More details can be found in the [Face - Detect](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236) API reference (the *faceIdTimeToLive* parameter).

## November 2020
### Sample Face enrollment app
* The team published a sample Face enrollment app to demonstrate best practices for establishing meaningful consent and creating high-accuracy face recognition systems through high-quality enrollments. The open-source sample can be found in the [Build an enrollment app](Tutorials/build-enrollment-app.md) guide and on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-FaceAPIEnrollmentSample), ready for developers to deploy or customize.
