# People detection (version 4.0 preview)

Version 4.0 of Image Analysis offers the ability to detect people appearing in images. The bounding box coordinates of each detected person are returned, along with a confidence score. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We built this model by enhancing our object detection model for person detection scenarios. People detection does not involve distinguishing one face from another face, predicting or classifying facial attributes, or creating a facial template (a unique set of numbers generated from an image that represents the distinctive features of a face).

## People detection example

The following JSON response illustrates what the Analysis 4.0 API returns when describing the example image based on its visual features.

{

## Use the API

The people detection feature is part of the [Image Analysis 4.0 API](https://aka.ms/vision-4-0-ref). Include `People` in the **features** query parameter. Then, when you get the full JSON response, parse the string for the contents of the `"people"` section.
