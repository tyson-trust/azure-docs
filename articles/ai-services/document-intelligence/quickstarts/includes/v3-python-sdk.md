[Client library](/python/api/overview/azure/ai-formrecognizer-readme?view=azure-python&preserve-view=true) [SDK reference](https://azuresdkdocs.blob.core.windows.net/$web/python/azure-ai-formrecognizer/3.3.0/index.html) | [API reference](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-2023-07-31/operations/AnalyzeDocument) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-formrecognizer/3.3.0/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-ai-formrecognizer_3.3.0/sdk/formrecognizer/azure-ai-formrecognizer/samples) | [Supported REST API versions](../../sdk-overview.md)

In this quickstart you'll, use the following features to analyze and extract data and values from forms and documents:

* [**General document**](#general-document-model)—Analyze and extract text, tables, structure, and key-value pairs.

* [**Layout**](#layout-model)—Analyze and extract tables, lines, words, and selection marks like radio buttons and check boxes in documents, without the need to train a model.

* [**Prebuilt Invoice**](#prebuilt-model)—Analyze and extract common fields from specific document types using a pretrained model.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)

* [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/)

  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.

* The latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred IDE. For more information, *see* [Getting Started with Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

* An Azure AI services or Document Intelligence resource. Once you have your Azure subscription, create a [single-service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) or [multi-service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne) Document Intelligence resource, in the Azure portal, to get your key and endpoint. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.

> [!TIP]
> Create an Azure AI services resource if you plan to access multiple Azure AI services under a single endpoint/key. For Document Intelligence access only, create a Document Intelligence resource. Please note that you'll  need a single-service resource if you intend to use [Azure Active Directory authentication](../../../../active-directory/authentication/overview-authentication.md).

* After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource**. You need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Document Intelligence API. You paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart:

## Set up

Open a terminal window in your local environment and install the Azure AI Document Intelligence client library for Python with pip:

```console
pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer==3.3.0
```

<!-- > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [I &#8203;ran into an issue with the setup.](https://microsoft.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0Cl5zkG3CnDjq6O?PLanguage=python&Product=FormRecognizer&Page=quickstart&Section=setup) -->

## Create your Python application

To interact with the Document Intelligence service, you need to create an instance of the `DocumentAnalysisClient` class. To do so, you create an `AzureKeyCredential` with your `key` from the Azure portal and a `DocumentAnalysisClient` instance with the `AzureKeyCredential` and your Document Intelligence `endpoint`.

1. Create a new Python file called **doc_intel_quickstart.py** in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Open the **doc_intel_quickstart.py** file and select one of the following code samples to copy and paste into your application:

    * [**General document**](#general-document-model)

    * [**Layout**](#layout-model)

    * [**Prebuilt Invoice**](#prebuilt-model)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information, *see* Azure AI services [security](../../../../ai-services/security-features.md).

## General document model

Extract text, tables, structure, and key-value pairs from documents.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * For this example, you'll need a **form document file from a URL**. You can use our [sample form document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-layout.pdf) for this quickstart.
> * To analyze a given file at a URL, you'll use the `begin_analyze_document_from_url` method and pass in `prebuilt-document` as the model Id. The returned value is a `result` object containing data about the submitted document.
> * We've added the file URL value to the `docUrl` variable in the `analyze_general_documents` function.

**Add the following code sample to your doc_intel_quickstart.py application. Make sure you update the key and endpoint variables with values from your Azure portal Document Intelligence instance:**

**Run the application**

Once you've added a code sample to your application, build and run your program:

1. Navigate to the folder where you have your **doc_intel_quickstart.py** file.
1. Type the following command in your terminal:

    ```console
    python doc_intel_quickstart.py
    ```

## Prebuilt model

Analyze and extract common fields from specific document types using a prebuilt model. In this example, we analyze an invoice using the **prebuilt-invoice** model.

> [!TIP]
> You aren't limited to invoices—there are several prebuilt models to choose from, each of which has its own set of supported fields. The model to use for the analyze operation depends on the type of document to be analyzed. See [**model data extraction**](../../concept-model-overview.md#model-data-extraction).

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Analyze an invoice using the prebuilt-invoice model. You can use our [sample invoice document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-REST-api-samples/master/curl/form-recognizer/sample-invoice.pdf) for this quickstart.
> * We've added the file URL value to the `invoiceUrl` variable at the top of the file.
> * To analyze a given file at a URI, you'll use the `begin_analyze_document_from_url` method and pass `prebuilt-invoice` as the model Id. The returned value is a `result` object containing data about the submitted document.
> * For simplicity, all the key-value pairs that the service returns are not shown here. To see the list of all supported fields and corresponding types, see our [Invoice](../../concept-invoice.md#field-extraction) concept page.

**Run the application**

Once you've added a code sample to your application, build and run your program:

1. Navigate to the folder where you have your **doc_intel_quickstart.py** file.
1. Type the following command in your terminal:

    ```console
    python doc_intel_quickstart.py
    ```
