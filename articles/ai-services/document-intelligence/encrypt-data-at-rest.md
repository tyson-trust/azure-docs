# Document Intelligence encryption of data at rest

[!INCLUDE [applies to v3.1, v3.0, and v2.1](includes/applies-to-v3-1-v3-0-v2-1.md)]

Azure AI Document Intelligence automatically encrypts your data when persisting it to the cloud. Document Intelligence encryption protects your data to help you to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.

[!INCLUDE [cognitive-services-about-encryption](../../ai-services/includes/cognitive-services-about-encryption.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed keys are only available resources created after 11 May, 2020. To use CMK with Document Intelligence, you will need to create a new Document Intelligence resource. Once the resource is created, you can use Azure Key Vault to set up your managed identity.
