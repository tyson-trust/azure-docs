 Azure AI Document Intelligence supports a wide variety of models that enable you to add intelligent document processing to your apps and flows. You can use a prebuilt document analysis or domain specific model or train a custom model tailored to your specific business needs and use cases. Document Intelligence can be used with the REST API or Python, C#, Java, and JavaScript SDKs.

|**Custom models**||
| [Custom model (overview)](#custom-models) |  Extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. Custom models are trained for your distinct data and use cases. |
| [Custom extraction models](#custom-extraction)| &#9679; **Custom template models** use layout cues to extract values from documents and are suitable to extract fields from highly structured documents with defined visual templates.</br>&#9679; **Custom neural models** are  trained on various document types to extract fields from structured, semi-structured and unstructured documents.|
| [Custom classification model](#custom-classifier)| The **Custom classification model** can classify each page in an input file to identify the document(s) within and can also identify multiple documents or multiple instances of a single document within an input file.

For all models, except Business card model, Document Intelligence now supports add-on capabilities to allow for more sophisticated analysis. These optional capabilities can be enabled and disabled depending on the scenario of the document extraction. There are four add-on capabilities available for the `2023-07-31` (GA) API version:

* [`ocr.highResolution`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#high-resolution-extraction)
* [`ocr.formula`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#formula-extraction)
* [`ocr.font`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#font-property-extraction)
* [`ocr.barcode`](concept-add-on-capabilities.md#barcode-extraction)

### Custom models

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom.png":::

Custom document models analyze and extract data from forms and documents specific to your business. They're trained to recognize form fields within your distinct content and extract key-value pairs and table data. You only need five examples of the same form type to get started.

Version v3.0 custom model supports signature detection in custom forms (template model) and cross-page tables in both template and neural models.

***Sample custom template processed using [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects)***:

> [Learn more: custom model](concept-custom.md)

#### Custom extraction

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom-extraction.png":::

Custom extraction model can be one of two types, **custom template** or **custom neural**. To create a custom extraction model, label a dataset of documents with the values you want extracted and train the model on the labeled dataset. You only need five examples of the same form or document type to get started.

***Sample custom extraction processed using [Document Intelligence Studio](https://formrecognizer.appliedai.azure.com/studio/customform/projects)***:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Learn more: custom neural model](./concept-custom-neural.md)

#### Custom classifier

:::image type="icon" source="media/studio/custom-classifier.png":::

The custom classification model enables you to identify the document type prior to invoking the extraction model.  The classification model is available starting with the 2023-02-28-preview. Training a custom classification model requires at least two distinct classes and a minimum of five samples per class.

#### Composed models

A composed model is created by taking a collection of custom models and assigning them to a single model built from your form types. You can assign multiple custom models to a composed model called with a single model ID. You can assign up to 200 trained custom models to a single composed model.
