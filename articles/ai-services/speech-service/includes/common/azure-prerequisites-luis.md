> * <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">Create a Language resource</a> in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production. You won't need a Speech resource this time. 
> * Get the Language resource key and region. After your Language resource is deployed, select **Go to resource** to view and manage keys.
