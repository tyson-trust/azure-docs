In this quickstart, you learn basic design patterns for speaker recognition by using the Speech SDK, including:

* Text-dependent and text-independent verification.
* Speaker identification to identify a voice sample among a group of voices.
* Deleting voice profiles.

For a high-level look at speaker recognition concepts, see the [Overview](../../../speaker-recognition-overview.md) article. See the **Reference** node in the left pane for a list of the supported platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft limits access to speaker recognition. Apply to use it through the [Azure AI Speaker Recognition Limited Access Review](https://aka.ms/azure-speaker-recognition) form. After approval, you can access the Speaker Recognition APIs.
