The Speech SDK for Java is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

On Windows, you must use the 64-bit target architecture. Windows 10 or later is required.

You must install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170&preserve-view=true) for your platform. Installing this package for the first time might require a restart.

The Speech SDK for Java doesn't support Windows on ARM64.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

The Speech SDK for Java only supports **Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04**, **Debian 10/11**, **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7/8**, and **CentOS 7/8** on the following architectures when used with Linux: x64, ARM32 (Debian/Ubuntu), and ARM64 (Debian/Ubuntu)
