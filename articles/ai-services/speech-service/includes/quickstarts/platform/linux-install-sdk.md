Use the following procedure to download and install the SDK. The steps include downloading the required libraries and header files as a .tar file from https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary.

1. Choose a directory to which the Speech SDK files should be extracted, and set the `SPEECHSDK_ROOT` environment variable to point to that directory. This variable makes it easy to refer to the directory in future commands. 

   For example, if you want to use the directory `speechsdk` in your home directory, use a command like the following:

   ```sh
   export SPEECHSDK_ROOT="$HOME/speechsdk"
   ```

1. Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Download and extract the `.tar.gz` archive that contains the Speech SDK binaries:

   ```sh
   wget -O SpeechSDK-Linux.tar.gz https://aka.ms/csspeech/linuxbinary
   tar --strip 1 -xzf SpeechSDK-Linux.tar.gz -C "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

1. Validate the contents of the top-level directory of the extracted package:

   ```sh
   ls -l "$SPEECHSDK_ROOT"
   ```

   The directory listing should contain the third-party notice and license files. The listing should also contain an `include` directory that holds header (`.h`) files and a `lib` directory that holds libraries for arm32, arm64, x64, and x86.

    | Path | Description |
    |:-----|:----|
    | `license.md` | License
    | `ThirdPartyNotices.md` | Third-party notices
    | `REDIST.txt` | Redistribution notice
    | `include` | Required header files for C++
    | `lib/arm32` | Native library for ARM32 required to link your application
    | `lib/arm64` | Native library for ARM64 required to link your application
    | `lib/x64` | Native library for x64 required to link your application
    | `lib/x86` | Native library for x86 required to link your application
