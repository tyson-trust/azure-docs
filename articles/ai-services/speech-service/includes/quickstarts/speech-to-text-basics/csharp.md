## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up the environment
The Speech SDK is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) and implements .NET Standard 2.0. You install the Speech SDK later in this guide, but first check the [SDK installation guide](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) for any more requirements.

### Set environment variables

[!INCLUDE [Environment variables](../../common/environment-variables.md)]

## Recognize speech from a microphone

Follow these steps to create a new console application and install the Speech SDK.

1. Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a console application with the .NET CLI. The `Program.cs` file should be created in the project directory.
    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet new console
    ```
1. Install the Speech SDK in your new project with the .NET CLI.
    ```dotnetcli
    dotnet add package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech
    ```
1. Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with the following code. 

    ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech;
    using Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Audio;

    class Program 
    {
        // This example requires environment variables named "SPEECH_KEY" and "SPEECH_REGION"
        static string speechKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SPEECH_KEY");
        static string speechRegion = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SPEECH_REGION");

        static void OutputSpeechRecognitionResult(SpeechRecognitionResult speechRecognitionResult)
        {
            switch (speechRecognitionResult.Reason)
            {
                case ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
                    Console.WriteLine($"RECOGNIZED: Text={speechRecognitionResult.Text}");
                    break;
                case ResultReason.NoMatch:
                    Console.WriteLine($"NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
                    break;
                case ResultReason.Canceled:
                    var cancellation = CancellationDetails.FromResult(speechRecognitionResult);
                    Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Reason={cancellation.Reason}");

                    if (cancellation.Reason == CancellationReason.Error)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorCode={cancellation.ErrorCode}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: ErrorDetails={cancellation.ErrorDetails}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?");
                    }
                    break;
            }
        }

        async static Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            var speechConfig = SpeechConfig.FromSubscription(speechKey, speechRegion);        
            speechConfig.SpeechRecognitionLanguage = "en-US";

            using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
            using var speechRecognizer = new SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

            Console.WriteLine("Speak into your microphone.");
            var speechRecognitionResult = await speechRecognizer.RecognizeOnceAsync();
            OutputSpeechRecognitionResult(speechRecognitionResult);
        }
    }
    ```

1. To change the speech recognition language, replace `en-US` with another [supported language](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md). For example, `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain). The default language is `en-US` if you don't specify a language. For details about how to identify one of multiple languages that might be spoken, see [language identification](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-identification.md). 

Run your new console application to start speech recognition from a microphone:

```console
dotnet run
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you set the `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION` environment variables as described [above](#set-environment-variables). If you don't set these variables, the sample will fail with an error message.

Speak into your microphone when prompted. What you speak should be output as text: 

```console
Speak into your microphone.
RECOGNIZED: Text=I'm excited to try speech to text.
```

## Remarks
Now that you've completed the quickstart, here are some additional considerations:

- This example uses the `RecognizeOnceAsync` operation to transcribe utterances of up to 30 seconds, or until silence is detected. For information about continuous recognition for longer audio, including multi-lingual conversations, see [How to recognize speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-recognize-speech.md).
- To recognize speech from an audio file, use `FromWavFileInput` instead of `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput`:
    ```csharp
    using var audioConfig = AudioConfig.FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
    ```
- For compressed audio files such as MP4, install GStreamer and use `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. For more information, see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
