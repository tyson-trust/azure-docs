[!INCLUDE [Header](../../common/cpp.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

## Set up the environment
The Speech SDK is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) and implements .NET Standard 2.0. You install the Speech SDK later in this guide, but first check the [SDK installation guide](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-cpp) for any more requirements.

### Set environment variables

[!INCLUDE [Environment variables](../../common/environment-variables.md)]

## Recognize speech from a microphone

Follow these steps to create a new console application and install the Speech SDK.

1. Create a new C++ console project in Visual Studio Community 2022 named `SpeechRecognition`.
1. Install the Speech SDK in your new project with the NuGet package manager.
    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech
    ```
1. Replace the contents of `SpeechRecognition.cpp` with the following code:
    
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream> 
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <speechapi_cxx.h>
    
    using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech;
    using namespace Microsoft::CognitiveServices::Speech::Audio;
    
    std::string GetEnvironmentVariable(const char* name);
    
    int main()
    {
        // This example requires environment variables named "SPEECH_KEY" and "SPEECH_REGION"
        auto speechKey = GetEnvironmentVariable("SPEECH_KEY");
        auto speechRegion = GetEnvironmentVariable("SPEECH_REGION");
        
        if ((size(speechKey) == 0) || (size(speechRegion) == 0)) {
            std::cout << "Please set both SPEECH_KEY and SPEECH_REGION environment variables." << std::endl;
            return -1;
        }
    
        auto speechConfig = SpeechConfig::FromSubscription(speechKey, speechRegion);
    
        speechConfig->SetSpeechRecognitionLanguage("en-US");
    
        auto audioConfig = AudioConfig::FromDefaultMicrophoneInput();
        auto speechRecognizer = SpeechRecognizer::FromConfig(speechConfig, audioConfig);
    
        std::cout << "Speak into your microphone.\n";
        auto result = speechRecognizer->RecognizeOnceAsync().get();
    
        if (result->Reason == ResultReason::RecognizedSpeech)
        {
            std::cout << "RECOGNIZED: Text=" << result->Text << std::endl;
        }
        else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::NoMatch)
        {
            std::cout << "NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized." << std::endl;
        }
        else if (result->Reason == ResultReason::Canceled)
        {
            auto cancellation = CancellationDetails::FromResult(result);
            std::cout << "CANCELED: Reason=" << (int)cancellation->Reason << std::endl;
    
            if (cancellation->Reason == CancellationReason::Error)
            {
                std::cout << "CANCELED: ErrorCode=" << (int)cancellation->ErrorCode << std::endl;
                std::cout << "CANCELED: ErrorDetails=" << cancellation->ErrorDetails << std::endl;
                std::cout << "CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?" << std::endl;
            }
        }
    }
    
    std::string GetEnvironmentVariable(const char* name)
    {
    #if defined(_MSC_VER)
        size_t requiredSize = 0;
        (void)getenv_s(&requiredSize, nullptr, 0, name);
        if (requiredSize == 0)
        {
            return "";
        }
        auto buffer = std::make_unique<char[]>(requiredSize);
        (void)getenv_s(&requiredSize, buffer.get(), requiredSize, name);
        return buffer.get();
    #else
        auto value = getenv(name);
        return value ? value : "";
    #endif
    }
    ```

1. To change the speech recognition language, replace `en-US` with another [supported language](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md). For example, `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain). The default language is `en-US` if you don't specify a language. For details about how to identify one of multiple languages that might be spoken, see [language identification](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-identification.md). 


[Build and run](/cpp/build/vscpp-step-2-build) your new console application to start speech recognition from a microphone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you set the `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION` environment variables as described [above](#set-environment-variables). If you don't set these variables, the sample will fail with an error message.

Speak into your microphone when prompted. What you speak should be output as text: 

```console
Speak into your microphone.
RECOGNIZED: Text=I'm excited to try speech to text.
```

## Remarks
Now that you've completed the quickstart, here are some additional considerations:

- This example uses the `RecognizeOnceAsync` operation to transcribe utterances of up to 30 seconds, or until silence is detected. For information about continuous recognition for longer audio, including multi-lingual conversations, see [How to recognize speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-recognize-speech.md).
- To recognize speech from an audio file, use `FromWavFileInput` instead of `FromDefaultMicrophoneInput`:
    ```cpp
    auto audioInput = AudioConfig::FromWavFileInput("YourAudioFile.wav");
    ```
- For compressed audio files such as MP4, install GStreamer and use `PullAudioInputStream` or `PushAudioInputStream`. For more information, see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
