> * <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAllInOne" title="Create an Azure AI services resource" target="_blank">Create a multi-service resource</a> in the Azure portal. This quickstart only requires one Azure AI services [multi-service resource](../../../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal). The sample code allows you to specify separate <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">Language</a> and <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices"  title="Create a Speech resource"  target="_blank">Speech</a> resource keys.
> * Get the resource key and region. After your Azure AI services resource is deployed, select **Go to resource** to view and manage keys. For more information about Azure AI services resources, see [Get the keys for your resource](~/articles/ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#get-the-keys-for-your-resource). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This quickstart requires access to [conversation summarization](../../../../language-service/summarization/how-to/conversation-summarization.md). To get access, you must submit an [online request](https://aka.ms/applyforconversationsummarization/) and have it approved. 
> 
> The `--languageKey` and `--languageEndpoint` values in this quickstart must correspond to a resource that's in one of the regions supported by the [conversation summarization API](https://aka.ms/convsumregions): `eastus`, `northeurope`, and `uksouth`.
