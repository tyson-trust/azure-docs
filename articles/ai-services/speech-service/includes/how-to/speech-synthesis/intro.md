In this how-to guide, you learn common design patterns for doing text to speech synthesis. 

See the text to speech [overview](../../../text-to-speech.md) for more information about:

* Getting responses as in-memory streams.
* Customizing output sample rate and bit rate.
* Submitting synthesis requests by using Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).
* Using neural voices.
* Subscribing to events and acting on results.
