You need to install several dependencies and plug-ins.

# [Ubuntu/Debian](#tab/debian)

```sh
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-0 \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
```

# [RHEL/CentOS](#tab/centos)

```sh
sudo yum install gstreamer1 \
gstreamer1-plugins-base \
gstreamer1-plugins-good \
gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free \
gstreamer1-plugins-ugly-free
```

> [!NOTE]
> On RHEL/CentOS 7 and RHEL/CentOS 8, in case of using "ANY" compressed format, more GStreamer plug-ins need to be installed if the stream media format plug-in isn't in the preceding installed plug-ins.
