# Publish a custom model 

Publishing your model makes it available for use with the Translator API. A project might have one or many successfully trained models. You can only publish one model per project; however, you can publish  a model to one or multiple regions depending on your needs. For more information, see [Translator pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/translator/#pricing).

## Publish your trained model

You can publish one model per project to one or multiple regions.
1. Select the **Publish model** blade.

1. Select *en-de with sample data* and select **Publish**.

1. Check the desired region(s).

1. Select **Publish**. The status should transition from _Deploying_ to _Deployed_.
