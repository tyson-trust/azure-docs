# What are Azure AI services?

Azure AI services help developers and organizations rapidly create intelligent, cutting-edge, market-ready, and responsible applications with out-of-the-box and pre-built and customizable APIs and models. Example applications include natural language processing for conversations, search, monitoring, translation, speech, vision, and decision-making. 

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI services rebrand](./includes/rebrand-note.md)]

Most Azure AI services are available through REST APIs and client library SDKs in popular development languages. For more information, see each service's documentation.

## Pricing tiers and billing

Pricing tiers (and the amount you get billed) are based on the number of transactions you send using your authentication information. Each pricing tier specifies the:
* maximum number of allowed transactions per second (TPS).
* service features enabled within the pricing tier.
* cost for a predefined number of transactions. Going above this number will cause an extra charge as specified in the [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/) for your service.

> [!NOTE]
> Many of the Azure AI services have a free tier you can use to try the service. To use the free tier, use `F0` as the SKU for your resource.


## Use Azure AI services in different development environments

With Azure and Azure AI services, you have access to several development options, such as:

* Automation and integration tools like Logic Apps and Power Automate.
