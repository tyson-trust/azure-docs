## Create environment variables 

In this example, you'll write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine running the application.

[!INCLUDE [find key and endpoint](./find-key.md)]

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't include the key directly in your code, and never post it publicly. See the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article for more authentication options like [Azure Key Vault](../../use-key-vault.md).

To set the environment variables, open a console window and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment. 

1. To set the `VISION_TRAINING KEY` environment variable, replace `your-training-key` with one of the keys for your training resource.
1. To set the `VISION_TRAINING_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `your-training-endpoint` with the endpoint for your training resource.
1. To set the `VISION_PREDICTION_KEY` environment variable, replace `your-prediction-key` with one of the keys for your prediction resource.
1. To set the `VISION_PREDICTION_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `your-prediction-endpoint` with the endpoint for your prediction resource.
1. To set the `VISION_PREDICTION_RESOURCE_ID` environment variable, replace `your-resource-id` with the resource ID for your prediction resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx VISION_TRAINING_KEY your-training-key
```

```console
setx VISION_TRAINING_ENDPOINT your-training-endpoint
```

```console
setx VISION_PREDICTION_KEY your-prediction-key
```

```console
setx VISION_PREDICTION_ENDPOINT your-prediction-endpoint
```

```console
setx VISION_PREDICTION_RESOURCE_ID your-resource-id
```

After you add the environment variables, you may need to restart any running programs that will read the environment variables, including the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export VISION_TRAINING_KEY=your-training-key
```

```bash
export VISION_TRAINING_ENDPOINT=your-training-endpoint
```

```bash
export VISION_PREDICTION_KEY=your-prediction-key
```

```bash
export VISION_PREDICTION_ENDPOINT=your-prediction-endpoint
```

```bash
export VISION_PREDICTION_RESOURCE_ID=your-resource-id
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.
