# Convert data format of utterances

[!INCLUDE [deprecation notice](./includes/deprecation-notice.md)]

LUIS provides the following conversions of a user utterance before prediction.

* Speech to text using [Azure AI Speech](../speech-service/overview.md) service.

## Speech to text

Speech to text is provided as an integration with LUIS.

### Intent conversion concepts
Conversion of speech to text in LUIS allows you to send spoken utterances to an endpoint and receive a LUIS prediction response. The process is an integration of the [Speech](../speech-service/overview.md) service with LUIS. Learn more about Speech to Intent with a [tutorial](../speech-service/how-to-recognize-intents-from-speech-csharp.md).

### Key requirements
You do not need to create a **Bing Speech API** key for this integration. A **Language Understanding** key created in the Azure portal works for this integration. Do not use the LUIS starter key.

### Pricing Tier
This integration uses a different [pricing](luis-limits.md#resource-usage-and-limits) model than the usual Language Understanding pricing tiers.

### Quota usage
See [Key limits](luis-limits.md#resource-usage-and-limits) for information.
