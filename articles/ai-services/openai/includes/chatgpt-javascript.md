[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/openai) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/tests/Samples)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with either the `gpt-35-turbo` or the `gpt-4`<sup>1</sup> models deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

<sup>1</sup> **GPT-4 models are currently only available by request.** Existing Azure OpenAI customers can [apply for access by filling out this form](https://aka.ms/oai/get-gpt4).

## Set up

### Install the client library

Create a new directory and navigate into that directory.

Install the Azure OpenAI client library for JavaScript with npm:

```console
npm install @azure/openai
```

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an **endpoint** and a **key**.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in the **Azure OpenAI Studio** > **Playground** > **Code View**. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `API-KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview UI for an OpenAI Resource in the Azure portal with the endpoint and access keys location circled in red." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png":::

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

### Environment variables

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
```

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create a sample application

Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a new file named ChatCompletion.js. Copy the following code into the ChatCompletion.js file.

```javascript
const { OpenAIClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/openai");
const endpoint = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"] ;
const azureApiKey = process.env["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"] ;

const messages = [
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
  { role: "user", content: "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI" },
  { role: "user", content: "Do other Azure AI services support this too" },
];

async function main() {
  console.log("== Chat Completions Sample ==");

  const client = new OpenAIClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(azureApiKey));
  const deploymentId = "gpt-35-turbo";
  const result = await client.getChatCompletions(deploymentId, messages);

  for (const choice of result.choices) {
    console.log(choice.message);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});

module.exports = { main };
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

```cmd
node.exe ChatCompletion.js
```

## Output

```output
== Chat Completions Sample ==
{
  role: 'assistant',
  content: 'Yes, most Azure AI services support customer managed keys. It is always best to check the specific service documentation to confirm this.'
}
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
