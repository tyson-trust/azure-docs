## Add your data using Azure OpenAI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Connect your data to OpenAI](./connect-your-data-studio.md)]


## Chat playground

Start exploring Azure OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the chat playground. It's simply a text box where you can submit a prompt to generate a completion. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with the capabilities. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/chat-playground.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the playground page of the Azure OpenAI Studio with sections highlighted." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/chat-playground.png":::

You can experiment with the configuration settings such as temperature and pre-response text to improve the performance of your task. You can read more about each parameter in the [REST API](../reference.md).

- Selecting the **Generate** button will send the entered text to the completions API and stream the results back to the text box.
- Select the **Undo** button to undo the prior generation call.
- Select the **Regenerate** button to complete an undo and generation call together.
