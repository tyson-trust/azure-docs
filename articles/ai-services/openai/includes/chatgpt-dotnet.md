[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/src) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.OpenAI/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/openai/Azure.AI.OpenAI/tests/Samples)

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- The [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with either the `gpt-35-turbo` or the `gpt-4`<sup>1</sup> models deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

<sup>1</sup> **GPT-4 models are currently only available by request.** Existing Azure OpenAI customers can [apply for access by filling out this form](https://aka.ms/oai/get-gpt4).

## Set up

### Create a new .NET Core application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `azure-openai-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" project with a single C# source file: *Program.cs*.

```dotnetcli
dotnet new console -n azure-openai-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```dotnetcli
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors.

```output
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

Install the OpenAI .NET client library with:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Azure.AI.OpenAI --prerelease
```

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you need an **endpoint** and a **key**.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in the **Azure OpenAI Studio** > **Playground** > **Code View**. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `API-KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview UI for an OpenAI Resource in the Azure portal with the endpoint and access keys location circled in red." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png":::

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

### Environment variables

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
```

```CMD
setx AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE"
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create .NET application

From the project directory, open the *program.cs* file and replace with the following code:

### Without response streaming

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using static System.Environment;

string endpoint = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");
string key = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY");

OpenAIClient client = new(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));

var chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?"),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Do other Azure AI services support this too?"),
    },
    MaxTokens = 100
};

Response<ChatCompletions> response = client.GetChatCompletions(
    deploymentOrModelName: "gpt-35-turbo", 
    chatCompletionsOptions);

Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Choices[0].Message.Content);

Console.WriteLine();
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

```cmd
dotnet run program.cs
```

## Output

```output
Yes, many of the Azure AI services support customer managed keys. Some examples include Text Analytics, Speech Services, and Translator. However, it's important to note that not all services support customer managed keys, so it's best to check the documentation for each individual service to see if it is supported.
```

This will wait until the model has generated its entire response before printing the results. Alternatively, if you want to asynchronously stream the response and print the results, you can replace the contents of *program.cs* with the code in the next example.

### Async with streaming

```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using static System.Environment;

string endpoint = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT");
string key = GetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_OPENAI_KEY");

OpenAIClient client = new(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));

var chatCompletionsOptions = new ChatCompletionsOptions()
{
    Messages =
    {
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.System, "You are a helpful assistant."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?"),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.Assistant, "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI."),
        new ChatMessage(ChatRole.User, "Do other Azure AI services support this too?"),
    },
    MaxTokens = 100
};

Response<StreamingChatCompletions> response = await client.GetChatCompletionsStreamingAsync(
    deploymentOrModelName: "gpt-35-turbo",
    chatCompletionsOptions);
using StreamingChatCompletions streamingChatCompletions = response.Value;

await foreach (StreamingChatChoice choice in streamingChatCompletions.GetChoicesStreaming())
{
    await foreach (ChatMessage message in choice.GetMessageStreaming())
    {
        Console.Write(message.Content);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
