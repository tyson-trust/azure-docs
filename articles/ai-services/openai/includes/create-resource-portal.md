## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you must submit an application to access Azure OpenAI Service. To apply for access, complete [this form](https://aka.ms/oai/access). If you need assistance, open an issue on this repository to contact Microsoft.

## Create a resource

The following steps show how to create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal. 

### Identify the resource

1. Sign in with your Azure subscription in the Azure portal.

1. Select **Create a resource** and search for the **Azure OpenAI Service**. When you locate the service, select **Create**.

1. On the **Create Azure OpenAI** page, provide the following information for the fields on the **Basics** tab:

   | Field | Description |
   |---|---|
   | **Subscription** | The Azure subscription used in your Azure OpenAI Service onboarding application. |
   | **Resource group** | The Azure resource group to contain your Azure OpenAI resource. You can create a new group or use a pre-existing group. |
   | **Region** | The location of your instance. Different locations can introduce latency, but they don't affect the runtime availability of your resource. |
   | **Name** | A descriptive name for your Azure OpenAI Service resource, such as _MyOpenAIResource_. |
   | **Pricing Tier** | The pricing tier for the resource. Currently, only the Standard tier is available for the Azure OpenAI Service. |

1. Select **Next**.

### Configure network security

The **Network** tab presents three options for the security **Type**:
   
- Option 1: **All networks, including the internet, can access this resource.**
- Option 2: **Selected networks, configure network security for your Azure AI services resource.**
- Option 3: **Disabled, no networks can access this resource. You could configure private endpoint connections that will be the exclusive way to access this resource.**

:::image type="content" source="../media/create-resource/create-resource-network-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the network security options for an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal.":::

Depending on the option you select, you might need to provide additional information.

#### Option 1: Allow all networks

The first option allows all networks, including the internet, to access your resource. This option is the default setting. No extra settings are required for this option.

#### Option 2: Allow specific networks only

The second option lets you identify specific networks that can access your resource. When you select this option, the page updates to include the following required fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Virtual network** | Specify the virtual networks that are permitted access to your resource. You can edit the default virtual network name in the Azure portal. |
| **Subnets** | Specify the subnets that are permitted access to your resource. You can edit the default subnet name in the Azure portal. |

:::image type="content" source="../media/create-resource/create-resource-network-settings-specific.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to configure network security for an Azure OpenAI resource to allow specific networks only.":::

The **Firewall** section provides an optional **Address range** field that you can use to configure firewall settings for the resource.

#### Option 3: Disable network access

The third option lets you disable network access to your resource. When you select this option, the page updates to include the **Private endpoint** table.

:::image type="content" source="../media/create-resource/create-resource-network-settings-disable.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to disable network security for an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal.":::

As an option, you can add a private endpoint for access to your resource. Select **Add private endpoint**, and complete the endpoint configuration.

### Confirm the configuration and create the resource

1. Select **Next** and configure any **Tags** for your resource, as desired.

1. Select **Next** to move to the final stage in the process: **Review + submit**.

1. Confirm your configuration settings, and select **Create**.

The Azure portal displays a notification when the new resource is available.

## Deploy a model

Before you can generate text or inference, you need to deploy a model. You can select from one of several available models in Azure OpenAI Studio.

To deploy a model, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com).

1. Choose the subscription and the Azure OpenAI resource to work with, and select **Use resource**.

1. Under **Management** select **Deployments**.

1. Select **Create new deployment** and configure the following fields:

   | Field | Description |
   |---|---|
   | **Select a model** | Model availability varies by region. For a list of available models per region, see [Model summary table and region availability](../concepts/models.md#model-summary-table-and-region-availability). |
   | **Deployment name** | Choose a name carefully. The deployment name is used in your code to call the model by using the client libraries and the REST APIs. |
   | **Advanced options** (Optional) | You can set optional advanced settings, as needed for your resource. <br> - For the **Content Filter**, assign a content filter to your deployment.<br> - For the **Tokens per Minute Rate Limit**, adjust the Tokens per Minute (TPM) to set the effective rate limit for your deployment. You can modify this value at any time by using the [**Quotas**](../how-to/quota.md) menu. |

   1. Select a model from the dropdown list.

   1. Enter a deployment name to help you identify the model.

   1. For your first deployment, leave the **Advanced options** set to the defaults.

1. Select **Create**.

The deployments table shows a new entry that corresponds to your newly created model.

When the deployment completes, your model deployment status changes to _succeeded_.
