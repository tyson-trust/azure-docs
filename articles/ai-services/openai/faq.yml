        answer: | 
          No, GPT-4 is designed by OpenAI to be multimodal, but currently only text input and output are supported.
      - question: |
          How do I apply for new use cases?
        answer: |
          Previously, the process for adding new use cases required customers to reapply to the service. Now, we're releasing a new process that allows you to quickly add new use cases to your use of the service. This process follows the established Limited Access process within Azure AI services. [Existing customers can attest to any and all new use cases here](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUM003VEJPRjRSOTZBRVZBV1E5N1lWMk1XUyQlQCN0PWcu). Please note that this is required anytime you would like to use the service for a new use case you did not originally apply for.
      - question: |
          I am trying to use embeddings and received the error "InvalidRequestError: Too many inputs. The max number of inputs is 1." How do I fix this?
        answer: | 
          This error typically occurs when you try to send a batch of text to embed in a single API request as an array. Currently Azure OpenAI only supports arrays of embeddings with multiple inputs for the `text-embedding-ada-002` Version 2 model. This model version supports an array consisting of up to 16 inputs per API request. The array can be up to 8191 tokens in length when using the text-embedding-ada-002 (Version 2) model.
      - question: |
          Where can I read about better ways to use Azure OpenAI to get the responses I want from the service?
        answer: | 
          Check out our [introduction to prompt engineering](./concepts/prompt-engineering.md) While these models are extremely powerful, their behavior is also very sensitive to the prompts they receive from the user. This makes prompt construction an important skill to develop. After you've mastered the introduction, check out our article on more [advanced prompt engineering techniques](./concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering.md).
      - question: |
          My guest account has been given access to an Azure OpenAI resource, but I am unable to access that resource in the Azure OpenAI Studio. How do I enable access?
        answer: | 
          This is expected behavior when using the default sign-in experience for the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com).
          
          To access Azure OpenAI Studio from a guest account that has been granted access to an Azure OpenAI resource:
          
          1. Open a private browser session and then navigate to [https://oai.azure.com](https://oai.azure.com).
          2. Rather than immediately entering your guest account credentials instead select **Sign-in options** 
          3. Now select **Sign in to an organization** 
          4. Enter the domain name of the organization that granted your guest account access to the Azure OpenAI resource. 
          5. Now sign-in with your guest account credentials. 
          
          You should now be able to access the resource via the Azure OpenAI Studio.
          
          Alternatively if you are signed into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) from the Azure OpenAI resource's Overview pane you can select **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio** to automatically sign in with the appropriate organizational context.

  - name: Models and fine-tuning
    questions:
      - question: |
          What models are available?
        answer: |
          Consult the Azure OpenAI [model availability guide](./concepts/models.md#model-summary-table-and-region-availability).
      - question: |
          Where can I find out what region a model is available in?
        answer: |
          Consult the Azure OpenAI [model availability guide](./concepts/models.md#model-summary-table-and-region-availability) for region availability.
      - question: |
          What is the difference between a base model and a fine-tuned model?
        answer:
          A base model is a model that hasn't been customized or fine-tuned for a specific use case. Fine-tuned models are customized versions of base models where a model's weights are trained on a unique set of prompts. Fine-tuned models let you achieve better results on a wider number of tasks without needing to provide detailed examples for in-context learning as part of your completion prompt. To learn more, review our [fine-tuning guide](./how-to/fine-tuning.md?pivots=programming-language-studio).
      - question: |
          What is the maximum number of fine-tuned models I can create?
        answer: |
          100
      - question: |
          What are the SLAs for API responses in Azure OpenAI?
        answer:
          We don't have a defined API response time Service Level Agreement (SLA) at this time. For more information about the SLA for Azure OpenAI Service, consult the [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services page](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cognitive-services/v1_1/).  
      - question: |
          Why was my fine-tuned model deployment deleted? 
        answer:
          If a customized (fine-tuned) model is deployed for more than fifteen (15) days during which no completions or chat completions calls are made to it, the deployment will automatically be deleted (and no further hosting charges will be incurred for that deployment). The underlying customized model will remain available and can be redeployed at any time. To learn more check out the [how-to-article](how-to/fine-tuning.md?pivots=programming-language-studio#deploy-a-customized-model).  
      - question: |
          How do I deploy a model with the REST API? 
        answer:
          There are currently two different REST APIs that allow model deployment. For the latest model deployment features such as the ability to specify a model version during deployment for models like text-embedding-ada-002 Version 2, use the [Deployments - Create Or Update](/rest/api/cognitiveservices/accountmanagement/deployments/create-or-update?tabs=HTTP) REST API call. 
      - question: |
          Can I use quota to increase the max token limit of a model?
        answer:
          No, quota Tokens-Per-Minute (TPM) allocation is not related to the max input token limit of a model. Model input token limits are defined in the [models table](./concepts/models.md) and are not impacted by changes made to TPM. 
  - name: Web app
    questions:
      - question: |
            How can I customize my published web app?
        answer:
          You can customize your published web app in the Azure portal. The source code for the published web app is [available on GitHub](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2244395), where you can find information on changing the app frontend, as well as instructions for building and deploying the app.
      - question: |
          Will my web app be overwritten when I deploy the app again from the Azure AI Studio?
        answer:
          Your app code will not be overwritten when you update your app. The app will be updated to use the Azure OpenAI resource, Azure Cognitive Search index (if you're using Azure OpenAI on your data), and model settings selected in the Azure OpenAI Studio without any change to the appearance or functionality.

          Yes, [Azure OpenAI on your data](./concepts/use-your-data.md) is part of the Azure OpenAI Service and works with the [models](./concepts/models.md) available in Azure OpenAI. The [content filtering](./concepts/content-filter.md) and abuse monitoring features of Azure OpenAI still apply. For more information, see the [overview of Responsible AI practices for Azure OpenAI models](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) and the [Transparency Note for Azure OpenAI](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext&tabs=text) for additional guidance on using Azure OpenAI on your data responsibly. 
      - question: |
          Is there a token limit on the system message?
        answer: 
          Yes, the token limit on the system message is 200. If the system message is more than 200 tokens, the rest of the tokens beyond the first 200 will be ignored.
      - question: |
          Do the query language and the data source language need to be the same?
        answer:
          You must send queries in the same language of your data. Your data can be in any of the languages supported by [Azure Cognitive Search](/azure/search/search-language-support).
      - question: |
          If Semantic Search is enabled for my Azure Cognitive Search resource, will it be automatically applied to Azure OpenAI on your data in the Azure OpenAI Studio?
        answer:
          When you select "Azure Cognitive Search" as the data source, you can choose to apply semantic search. 
          If you select "Azure Blob Container" or "Upload files" as the data source, you can create the index as usual. Afterwards you would re-ingest the data using the "Azure Cognitive Search" option to select the same index and apply Semantic Search. You will then be ready to chat on your data with semantic search applied.
