# Quickstart: Chat with Azure OpenAI models using your own data

In this quickstart you can use your own data with Azure OpenAI models. Using Azure OpenAI's models on your data can provide you with a powerful conversational AI platform that enables faster and more accurate communication.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

    Azure OpenAI requires registration and is currently only available to approved enterprise customers and partners. [See Limited access to Azure OpenAI Service](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context) for more information. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

- An Azure OpenAI resource with a chat model deployed (for example, GPT-3 or GPT-4). For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](./how-to/create-resource.md).

    - Your chat model must use version `0301`. You can view or change your model version in [Azure OpenAI Studio](./concepts/models.md#model-updates).

- Be sure that you are assigned at least the [Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#cognitive-services-openai-contributor) role for the Azure OpenAI resource.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an OpenAI or Azure Cognitive Search resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

- [Azure Cognitive Search resources](/azure/search/search-get-started-portal#clean-up-resources)
