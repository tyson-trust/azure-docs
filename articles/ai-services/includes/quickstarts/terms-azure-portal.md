You must create your first Face, Language service, or Azure AI Vision resources from the Azure portal to review and acknowledge the terms and conditions. You can do so here: [Face](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace), [Language service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics), [Azure AI Vision](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision). After that, you can create subsequent resources using any deployment tool (SDK, CLI, or ARM template, etc) under the same Azure subscription.
