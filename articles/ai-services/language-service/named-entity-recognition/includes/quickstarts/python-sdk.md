[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-ai-textanalytics/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true&view=azure-python) | [Additional samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics) 

Use this quickstart to create a Named Entity Recognition (NER) application with the client library for Python. In the following example, you will create a Python application that can identify [recognized entities](../../concepts/named-entity-categories.md) in text.

[!INCLUDE [Use Language Studio](../../../includes/use-language-studio.md)]

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services)
* [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a Language resource"  target="_blank">create a Language resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`Free F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
* To use the Analyze feature, you will need a Language resource with the standard (S) pricing tier.



## Setting up

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0
```



## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Remember to replace the `key` variable with the key for your resource, and replace the `endpoint` variable with the endpoint for your resource. Then run the code.  

[!INCLUDE [find the key and endpoint for a resource](../../../includes/find-azure-resource-info.md)]

```python
key = "paste-your-key-here"
endpoint = "paste-your-endpoint-here"

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example function for recognizing entities from text
def entity_recognition_example(client):

    try:
        documents = ["I had a wonderful trip to Seattle last week."]
        result = client.recognize_entities(documents = documents)[0]

        print("Named Entities:\n")
        for entity in result.entities:
            print("\tText: \t", entity.text, "\tCategory: \t", entity.category, "\tSubCategory: \t", entity.subcategory,
                    "\n\tConfidence Score: \t", round(entity.confidence_score, 2), "\tLength: \t", entity.length, "\tOffset: \t", entity.offset, "\n")

    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
entity_recognition_example(client)
```



## Output

```console
Named Entities:

    Text:    trip   Category:        Event  SubCategory:     None
    Confidence Score:        0.74   Length:          4      Offset:          18

    Text:    Seattle        Category:        Location       SubCategory:     GPE
    Confidence Score:        1.0    Length:          7      Offset:          26

    Text:    last week      Category:        DateTime       SubCategory:     DateRange
    Confidence Score:        0.8    Length:          9      Offset:          34
```
