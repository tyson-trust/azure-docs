# Quickstart: Custom sentiment analysis

Use this article to get started with creating a Custom sentiment analysis project where you can train custom models for detecting the sentiment of text. A model is artificial intelligence software that's trained to do a certain task. For this system, the models classify text, and are trained by learning from tagged data.

::: zone pivot="language-studio"

[!INCLUDE [Language Studio quickstart](../includes/custom/quickstarts/language-studio.md)]

::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="rest-api"

[!INCLUDE [REST API quickstart](../includes/custom/quickstarts/rest-api.md)]

::: zone-end

## Next steps

After you've created a Custom sentiment analysis model, you can:
