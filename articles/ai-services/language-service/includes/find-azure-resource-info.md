> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the Language resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint by navigating to your resource's **Keys and Endpoint** page, under **Resource Management**. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). See the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article for more information.
