|`{PROJECT-NAME}`     | The name for your project. This value is case-sensitive.   | `myProject` |
|`{trainedModelLabel}`     | The name for your model name. This value is case-sensitive.   | `model1` |
|`{API-VERSION}`     | The version of the API you're calling. The value referenced here is for the latest version released. See [Model lifecycle](../../concepts/model-lifecycle.md) to learn more about other available API versions.  | `2022-05-01` |

### Headers
