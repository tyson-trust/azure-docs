# Quickstart: custom Text Analytics for health

Use this article to get started with creating a custom Text Analytics for health project where you can train custom models on top of Text Analytics for health for custom entity recognition. A model is artificial intelligence software that's trained to do a certain task. For this system, the models extract healthcare related named entities and are trained by learning from labeled data.

In this article, we use Language Studio to demonstrate key concepts of custom Text Analytics for health. As an example weâ€™ll build a custom Text Analytics for health model to extract the Facility or treatment location from short discharge notes.
