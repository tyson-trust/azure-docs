To use summarization, you submit raw unstructured text for analysis and handle the API output in your application. Analysis is performed as-is, with no additional customization to the model used on your data. There are two ways to use summarization:

# [Document summarization](#tab/document-summarization)

|Development option  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Language studio     | Language Studio is a web-based platform that lets you try entity linking with text examples without an Azure account, and your own data when you sign up. For more information, see the [Language Studio website](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/tryout/summarization) or [language studio quickstart](../../language-studio.md).         |
|REST API or Client library (Azure SDK)      | Integrate document summarization into your applications using the REST API, or the client library available in a variety of languages. For more information, see the [summarization quickstart](../quickstart.md).        |


# [Conversation summarization](#tab/conversation-summarization)

|Development option  |Description  | Links |
|---------|---------|---------|
| REST API     | Integrate conversation summarization into your applications using the REST API. | [Quickstart: Use conversation summarization](../quickstart.md?tabs=conversation-summarization&pivots=rest-api) |
