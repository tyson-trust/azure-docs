# Quickstart: custom summarization (preview)

Use this article to get started with creating a custom Summarization project where you can train custom models on top of Summarization. A model is artificial intelligence software that's trained to do a certain task. For this system, the models summarize text and are trained by learning from imported data.

In this article, we use Language Studio to demonstrate key concepts of custom summarization. As an example weâ€™ll build a custom summarization model to extract the Facility or treatment location from short discharge notes.
