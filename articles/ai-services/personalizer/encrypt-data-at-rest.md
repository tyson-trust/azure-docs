# Encryption of data at rest in Personalizer

Personalizer is a service in Azure AI services that uses a machine learning model to provide apps with user-tailored content. When Personalizer persists data to the cloud, it encrypts that data. This encryption protects your data and helps you meet organizational security and compliance commitments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer-managed keys are only available with the E0 pricing tier. To request the ability to use customer-managed keys, fill out and submit the [Personalizer Service Customer-Managed Key Request Form](https://aka.ms/cogsvc-cmk). It takes approximately 3-5 business days to hear back about the status of your request. If demand is high, you might be placed in a queue and approved when space becomes available.
>
> After you're approved to use customer-managed keys with Personalizer, create a new Personalizer resource and select E0 as the pricing tier. After you've created that resource, you can use Azure Key Vault to set up your managed identity.
