      - question: |
          What is the difference between the Azure Content Moderator and Azure AI Content Safety services?
        answer: |
          The main differences between the two services are:

          - Azure Content Moderator uses binary classification for each content type (such as `profanity` or `adult`), while Azure AI Content Safety uses multiple classes (such as `sexual`, `violent`, `hate`, and `self-harm`) with different severity levels.
          - Azure Content Safety supports multilingual content moderation in English, German, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese, while Azure Content Moderator's AI classifiers only support English.
          - Azure Content Moderator has a built-in term list and a custom term list feature, while Azure AI Content Safety does not have a built-in term list but relies on advanced language and vision models to detect harmful content. It also provides a custom term list feature for incident response and customization.
          - Azure AI Content Safety has an interactive studio for exploring and testing the service capabilities, while Azure Content Moderator does not.
