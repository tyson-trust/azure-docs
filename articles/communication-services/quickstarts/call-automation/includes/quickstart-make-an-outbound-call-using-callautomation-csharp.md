## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](../../create-communication-resource.md).
- A [phone number](../../telephony/get-phone-number.md) in your Azure Communication Services resource that can make outbound calls. If you have a free subscription, you can [get a trial phone number](../../telephony/get-trial-phone-number.md).
- Create and host an Azure Dev Tunnel. Instructions [here](/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started)

## Sample code
Download or clone quickstart sample code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-dotnet-quickstarts/tree/callautomation/callautomationQuickStart/CallAutomation_OutboundCalling).

Navigate to `CallAutomation_OutboundCalling` folder and open the solution in a code editor.

## Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel

[Azure DevTunnels](/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Run the commands to connect your local development environment to the public internet. DevTunnels creates a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We use this endpoint to notify your application of calling events from the ACS Call Automation service.

```bash
devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create -p 8080
devtunnel host
```

## Update your application configuration

Next update your `Program.cs` file with the following values:

- `acsConnectionString`: The connection string for your ACS resource. You can find your ACS connection string using the instructions [here](../../create-communication-resource.md). 
- `callbackUriHost`: Once you have your DevTunnel host initialized, update this field with that URI.
- `acsPhonenumber`: update this field with the ACS phone number you have acquired. This phone number should use the [E164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) phone number format (e.g +18881234567)
- `targetPhonenumber`: update field with the phone number you would like your application to call. This phone number should use the [E164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) phone number format (e.g +18881234567)

```csharp
// Your ACS resource connection string
var acsConnectionString = "<ACS_CONNECTION_STRING>";

// Your ACS resource phone number will act as source number to start outbound call
var acsPhonenumber = "<ACS_PHONE_NUMBER>";

// Target phone number you want to receive the call.
var targetPhonenumber = "<TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER>";

// Base url of the app
var callbackUriHost = "<CALLBACK_URI_HOST_WITH_PROTOCOL>";
```

## Make an outbound call

To make the outbound call from ACS, this sample uses the `targetPhonenumber` you defined earlier in the application to create the call using the `CreateCallAsync` API. This code will make an outbound call using the target phone number.

```csharp
PhoneNumberIdentifier target = new PhoneNumberIdentifier(targetPhonenumber);
PhoneNumberIdentifier caller = new PhoneNumberIdentifier(acsPhonenumber);
CallInvite callInvite = new CallInvite(target, caller);
CreateCallResult createCallResult = await callAutomationClient.CreateCallAsync(callInvite, new Uri(callbackUriHost + "/api/callbacks"));
```

## Handle call automation events

Earlier in our application, we registered the `callbackUriHost` to the Call Automation Service. The host indicates the endpoint the service requires to notify us of calling events that happen. We can then iterate through the events and detect specific events our application wants to understand. In the code be below we respond to the `CallConnected` event.

```csharp
app.MapPost("/api/callbacks", async (CloudEvent[] cloudEvents, ILogger<Program> logger) =>
{
    foreach (var cloudEvent in cloudEvents)
    {
        logger.LogInformation($"Event received: {JsonConvert.SerializeObject(cloudEvent)}");

        CallAutomationEventBase parsedEvent = CallAutomationEventParser.Parse(cloudEvent);
        logger.LogInformation($"{parsedEvent?.GetType().Name} parsedEvent received for call connection id: {parsedEvent?.CallConnectionId}");
        var callConnection = callAutomationClient.GetCallConnection(parsedEvent.CallConnectionId);
        var callMedia = callConnection.GetCallMedia();

        if (parsedEvent is CallConnected)
        {
            //Handle Call Connected Event
        }
    }
});
```

## Start recording a call

The Call Automation service also enables the capability to start recording and store recordings of voice and video calls. You can learn more about the various capabilities in the Call Recording APIs [here](../../voice-video-calling/get-started-call-recording.md).

```csharp
CallLocator callLocator = new ServerCallLocator(parsedEvent.ServerCallId);
var recordingResult = await callAutomationClient.GetCallRecording().StartAsync(new StartRecordingOptions(callLocator));
recordingId = recordingResult.Value.RecordingId;
```

## Play welcome message and recognize 

Using the `FileSource` API, you can provide the service the audio file you want to use for your welcome message. The ACS Call Automation service plays this message upon the `CallConnected` event. 

Next, we pass the audio file into the `CallMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions` and then call `StartRecognizingAsync`. This recognizes and options API enables the telephony client to send DTMF tones that we can recognize.

```csharp
// prepare recognize tones
CallMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions = new CallMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions(new PhoneNumberIdentifier(targetPhonenumber), maxTonesToCollect: 1);
callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions.Prompt = new FileSource(new Uri(callbackUriHost + "/audio/MainMenu.wav"));
callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions.InterruptPrompt = true;
callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions.InitialSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions.InterToneTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10);
callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions.StopTones = new List<DtmfTone> { DtmfTone.Pound, DtmfTone.Asterisk };

// Send request to recognize tones
await callMedia.StartRecognizingAsync(callMediaRecognizeDtmfOptions);
```

## Handle DTMF Events

When the telephony endpoint selects a DTMF tone, ACS Call Automation triggers the `api/callbacks` webhook we have setup and notify us with the `RecognizeCompleted` event. The event gives us the ability to respond to a specific DTMF tone and trigger an action. Then the application plays an audio file in response to DTMF tone one.

```csharp
if (parsedEvent is RecognizeCompleted recognizeCompleted)
{
    // Play audio once recognition is completed sucessfully
    string selectedTone = ((DtmfResult)recognizeCompleted.RecognizeResult).ConvertToString();

    switch (selectedTone)
    {
        case "1":
            await callMedia.PlayToAllAsync(new FileSource(new Uri(callbackUriHost + "/audio/Confirmed.wav")));
            break;

        case "2":
            await callMedia.PlayToAllAsync(new FileSource(new Uri(callbackUriHost + "/audio/Goodbye.wav")));         
            break;

        default:
            //invalid tone
            await callMedia.PlayToAllAsync(new FileSource(new Uri(callbackUriHost + "/audio/Invalid.wav")));
            break;
    }
}
```
## Hang up and stop recording

Finally, when we detect a condition that makes sense for us to terminate the call, we can use the `HangUpAsync` method to hang up the call.

```csharp
if ((parsedEvent is PlayCompleted) || (parsedEvent is PlayFailed))
{
    logger.LogInformation($"Stop recording and terminating call.");
    callAutomationClient.GetCallRecording().Stop(recordingId);
    await callConnection.HangUpAsync(true);
}
```

## Run the code

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

To run the application with VS Code, open a Terminal window and run the following command

```bash
dotnet run
```

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

Press Ctrl+F5 to run without the debugger.
