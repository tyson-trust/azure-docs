## Sample Code

You can download the sample app from [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-javascript-quickstarts/tree/main/call-recording)

## Prerequisites

- You need an Azure account with an active subscription.
- Deploy a Communication Service resource. Record your resource **connection string**.
- Subscribe to events via [Azure Event Grid](../../../../../event-grid/event-schema-communication-services.md).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) Active LTS and Maintenance LTS versions (8.11.1 and 10.14.1 recommended)

## Before you start

Call Recording APIs use exclusively the `serverCallId`to initiate recording. There are a couple of methods you can use to fetch the `serverCallId` depending on your scenario:

### Call Automation scenarios
- When using [Call Automation](../../../call-automation/callflows-for-customer-interactions.md), you have two options to get the `serverCallId`:
    1) Once a call is created, a `serverCallId` is returned as a property of the `CallConnected` event after a call has been established. Learn how to [Get CallConnected event](../../../call-automation/callflows-for-customer-interactions.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript#update-programcs) from Call Automation SDK.
    2) Once you answer the call or a call is created the `serverCallId` is returned as a property of the `AnswerCallResult` or `CreateCallResult` API responses respectively.

### Calling SDK scenarios
- When using [Calling Client SDK](../../get-started-with-video-calling.md), you can retrieve the `serverCallId` by using the `getServerCallId` method on the call.
Use this example to learn how to [Get serverCallId](../../get-server-call-id.md) from the Calling Client SDK.



Let's get started with a few simple steps!



## 1. Create a Call Automation client

Call Recording APIs are part of the Azure Communication Services [Call Automation](../../../../concepts/call-automation/call-automation.md) libraries. Thus, it's necessary to create a Call Automation client.
To create a call automation client, you'll use your Communication Services connection string and pass it to `CallAutomationClient` object.

```javascript
const callAutomationClient = new CallAutomationClient.CallAutomationClient("<ACSConnectionString>");
```

## 2. Start recording session with StartRecordingOptions using 'StartAsync' API

Use the `serverCallId` received during initiation of the call.
- RecordingContent is used to pass the recording content type. Use audio
- RecordingChannel is used to pass the recording channel type. Use mixed or unmixed.
- RecordingFormat is used to pass the format of the recording. Use wav.

```javascript
var locator: CallLocator = { id: "<ServerCallId>", kind: "serverCallLocator" };

var options: StartRecordingOptions =
{
  callLocator: locator,
  recordingContent: "audio",
  recordingChannel:"unmixed",
  recordingFormat: "wav",
  recordingStateCallbackEndpointUrl: "<CallbackUri>"
};
var response = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().start(options);
```

### 2.1. Only for Unmixed - Specify a user on channel 0
To produce unmixed audio recording files, you can use the `AudioChannelParticipantOrdering` functionality to specify which user you want to record on channel 0. The rest of the participants will be assigned to a channel as they speak. If you use `RecordingChannel.Unmixed` but don't use `AudioChannelParticipantOrdering`, Call Recording will assign channel 0 to the first participant speaking.

```javascript
var locator: CallLocator = { id: "<ServerCallId>", kind: "serverCallLocator" };

var options: StartRecordingOptions =
{
  callLocator: locator,
  recordingContent: "audio",
  recordingChannel:"unmixed",
  recordingFormat: "wav",
  recordingStateCallbackEndpointUrl: "<CallbackUri>",
  audioChannelParticipantOrdering:[{communicationUserId: "<ACS_USER_MRI>"}]
};
var response = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().start(options);
```

### 2.2. Only for Unmixed - Specify channel affinity

```javascript
var options: StartRecordingOptions =
{
  callLocator: locator,
  recordingContent: "audio",
  recordingChannel:"unmixed",
  recordingFormat: "wav",
  recordingStateCallbackEndpointUrl: "<CallbackUri>",
  ChannelAffinity:
  [
    {
      channel:0,
      targetParticipant:{communicationUserId: "<ACS_USER_MRI>"}
    }
  ]
};
var response = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().start(options);
```
The `StartAsync` API response contains the `recordingId` of the recording session.

## 3.	Stop recording session using 'stop' API

Use the `recordingId` received in response of `start`.

```javascript
var stopRecording = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().stop(recordingId);
```

## 4.	Pause recording session using 'pause' API

Use the `recordingId` received in response of `start`.

```javascript
var pauseRecording = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().pause(recordingId);
```

## 5.	Resume recording session using 'ResumeAsync' API

Use the `recordingId` received in response of `start`.

```javascript
var resumeRecording = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().resume(recordingId);
```

## 6.	Download recording File using 'DownloadToAsync' API

Use an [Azure Event Grid](../../../../../event-grid/event-schema-communication-services.md) web hook or other triggered action should be used to notify your services when the recorded media is ready for download.

An Event Grid notification `Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated` is published when a recording is ready for retrieval, typically a few minutes after the recording process has completed (for example, meeting ended, recording stopped). Recording event notifications include `contentLocation` and `metadataLocation`, which are used to retrieve both recorded media and a recording metadata file.

Below is an example of the event schema.

```
{
    "id": string, // Unique guid for event
    "topic": string, // /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{group-name}/providers/Microsoft.Communication/communicationServices/{communication-services-resource-name}
    "subject": string, // /recording/call/{call-id}/serverCallId/{serverCallId}
    "data": {
        "recordingStorageInfo": {
            "recordingChunks": [
                {
                    "documentId": string, // Document id for for the recording chunk
                    "contentLocation": string, //Azure Communication Services URL where the content is located
                    "metadataLocation": string, // Azure Communication Services URL where the metadata for this chunk is located
                    "deleteLocation": string, // Azure Communication Services URL to use to delete all content, including recording and metadata.
                    "index": int, // Index providing ordering for this chunk in the entire recording
                    "endReason": string, // Reason for chunk ending: "SessionEnded", "ChunkMaximumSizeExceeded”, etc.
                }
            ]
        },
        "recordingStartTime": string, // ISO 8601 date time for the start of the recording
        "recordingDurationMs": int, // Duration of recording in milliseconds
        "sessionEndReason": string // Reason for call ending: "CallEnded", "InitiatorLeft”, etc.
    },
    "eventType": string, // "Microsoft.Communication.RecordingFileStatusUpdated"
    "dataVersion": string, // "1.0"
    "metadataVersion": string, // "1"
    "eventTime": string // ISO 8601 date time for when the event was created
}
```

Use `downloadToPath` API for downloading the recorded media.

```javascript
var response = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().downloadToPath(contentLocation, fileName);
```
The `downloadLocation` for the recording can be fetched from the `contentLocation` attribute of the `recordingChunk`. `DownloadToAsync` method download the content into provided filename.

## 7. Delete recording content using 'DeleteAsync' API

Use `delete` API for deleting the recording content (for example, recorded media, metadata)

```javascript
var response = await callAutomationClient.getCallRecording().delete(deleteLocation);
```
