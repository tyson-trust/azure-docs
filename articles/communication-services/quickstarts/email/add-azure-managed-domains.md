# Quickstart: How to add Azure Managed Domains to Email Communication Service

In this quick start, you learn about how to provision the Azure Managed domain in Azure Communication Services to send email.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/dotnet/).
- An Azure Email Communication Services Resource created and ready to provision the domains [Get started with Creating Email Communication Resource](../../quickstarts/email/create-email-communication-resource.md)

## Azure Managed Domains vs. Custom Domains

Before provisioning an Azure Managed Domain, review the following table to determine which domain type is most appropriate for your particular use case.

| | [Azure Managed Domains](./add-azure-managed-domains.md) | [Custom Domains](./add-custom-verified-domains.md) | 
|---|---|---|
|**Pros:** | - Setup is quick & easy<br/>- No domain verification required<br /> | - Emails are sent from your own domain |
|**Cons:** | - Sender domain is not personalized and cannot be changed | - Requires verification of domain records <br /> - Longer setup for verification |


## Provision Azure Managed Domain

1. Go the overview page of the Email Communications Service resource that you created earlier.
2. Create the Azure Managed Domain.   
    - (Option 1) Click the **1-click add** button under **Add a free Azure subdomain**. Move to the next step.

## Sender authentication for Azure Managed Domain
Azure communication Services Email automatically configures the required email authentication protocols to set proper authentication for the email as detailed in [Email Authentication best practices](../../concepts/email/email-authentication-best-practice.md). 

## Changing MailFrom and FROM display name for Azure Managed Domain

You can optionally configure your MailFrom address to be something other than the default DoNotReply, and also add more than one sender username to your domain. To understand how to configure your sender address, see how to [add multiple sender addresses](add-multiple-senders.md).

**Your email domain is now ready to send emails.**
