# Quickstart: Add emergency calling

Add emergency calling to your PSTN-enabled application by using the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK.

::: zone pivot="platform-web"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with JavaScript](./includes/emergency-calling-javascript.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-android"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with Android](./includes/emergency-calling-android.md)]
::: zone-end

::: zone pivot="platform-ios"
[!INCLUDE [Calling with iOS](./includes/emergency-calling-ios.md)]
::: zone-end

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any resources that are associated with it. [Learn more about cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
