## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues related to SMS delivery, you can [enable delivery reporting with Event Grid](./handle-sms-events.md) to capture delivery details.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Communication Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it. Learn more about [cleaning up resources](../create-communication-resource.md#clean-up-resources).
