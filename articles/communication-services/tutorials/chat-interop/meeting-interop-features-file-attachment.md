# Tutorial: Enable file attachment support in your Chat app

The Chat SDK is designed to work with Microsoft Teams seamlessly. Specifically, Chat SDK provides a solution to receive file attachments sent by users from Microsoft Teams. Currently this feature is only available in the Chat SDK for JavaScript. Please note that sending file attachments from ACS user to Teams user is not currently supported, see the current capabilities of [Teams Interop Chat](../../concepts/interop/guest/capabilities.md) for details.

## Add file attachment support

The Chat SDK for JavaScript provides `previewUrl` and `url` for each file attachment. Specifically, `url` provides a direct download URL to the file. While `previewUrl` provides a link to a webpage on SharePoint where the user can see the content of the file, edit the file and download the file if permission allows. 

You should be aware of couple constraints that come with this feature:

1. The Teams admin of the sender's tenant could impose policies that limits or disable this feature entirely. For example, the Teams admin could disable certain permissions (such as "Anyone") that could cause the file attachment URLs (`previewUrl` and `Url`) to be inaccessible. 
2. We currently only support the following file permissions:
   - "Anyone", and
   - "People you choose" (with email address)

   The Teams user should be made aware of that all other permissions (such as "People in your organization") aren't supported. The Teams user should double check if the default permission is supported after uploading the file on their Teams client. 
3. The direct download URL (`url`) might be inaccessible if file is protected (files with restricted permissions such as file being password protected or shared with a specific email address owner)

In addition to regular files (with `AttachmentType` of `file`), the Chat SDK for JavaScript also provides the `AttachmentType` of `teamsImage` for image attachments so that you can use it to mirror the behavior of how Microsoft Teams client converts image attachment to inline images in the UI layer. See section "Image Attachment Handling" for more info. 

Note that images added via "Upload from this device" renders on Teams side, and Chat SDK for JavaScript would be returning such attachments as `teamsImage`. For images uploaded via "Attach cloud files" however, they would be treated as regular files on the Teams side, and therefore Chat SDK for JavaScript would be returning such attachments as `file`.

Also note that only files uploaded via "drag-and-drop" or via attachment menu of "Upload from this device" and "Attach cloud files" are supported. Some messages with embedded media (such as video clips, audio messages, weather cards, etc.) are adaptive card, which currently isn't supported.
