# Deliver expedient customer service by adding Microsoft Teams users in Call Automation workflows

[!INCLUDE [Private Preview Notice](../../includes/private-preview-include.md)]

Businesses are looking for innovative ways to increase the efficiency of their customer service operations. Azure Communication Services Call Automation provides developers the ability to build programmable customer interactions using real-time event triggers to perform actions based on custom business logic. For example, with support for interoperability with Microsoft Teams, developers can use Call Automation APIs to add subject matter experts (SMEs). These SMEs, who use Microsoft Teams, can be added to an existing customer service call to provide expert advice and help resolve a customer issue.

This interoperability with Microsoft Teams over VoIP makes it easy for developers to implement per-region multi-tenant trunks that maximize value and reduce telephony infrastructure overhead. Each new tenant will be able to use this setup in a few minutes after Microsoft Teams admin has granted necessary permissions to the Azure Communication Services resource.

## Use-cases

1. Expert Consultation: Businesses can invite subject matter experts into their customer service workflows for expedient issue resolution, and to improve their first call resolution rate. 
1. Extend customer service workforce with knowledge workers: Businesses can extend their customer service operation with more capacity during peak influx of customer service calls.

## Scenario Showcase – Expert Consultation
A customer service agent, who is using a Contact Center Agent experience, wants to now add a subject matter expert, who is knowledge worker (regular employee) at Contoso and uses Microsoft Teams, into a support call with a customer to provide some expert advice to resolve a customer issue. 

The dataflow diagram depicts a canonical scenario where a Teams user is added to an ongoing ACS call for expert consultation.

1. Customer is on an ongoing call with a Contact Center customer service agent. 
1. During the call, the customer service agent needs expert help from one of the domain experts part of an engineering team. The agent is able to identify a knowledge worker who is available on Teams (presence via Graph APIs) and tries to add them to the call. 
1. Contoso Contact Center’s SBC is already configured with ACS Direct Routing where this add participant request is processed.
1. Contoso Contact Center provider has implemented a web service, using ACS Call Automation that receives the “add Participant” request.
1. With Teams interop built into ACS Call Automation, ACS then uses the Teams user’s ObjectId to add them to the call. The Teams user receives the incoming call notification. They accept and join the call. 
1. Once the Teams user has provided their expertise, they leave the call. The customer service agent and customer continue wrap up their conversation.
