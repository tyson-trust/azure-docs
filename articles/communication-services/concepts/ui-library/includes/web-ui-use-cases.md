Use components and composites in the Azure Communication Services UI Library to create call and chat experiences in your applications. 

In a composite, call and chat capabilities are built in directly and exposed when you integrate the composite into an application. In a UI component, call and chat capabilities are exposed through a combination of UI functionality and underlying stateful libraries. To take full advantage of these capabilities, we recommend that you use UI components with stateful call and chat client libraries.

\*Microsoft Teams allows users to share attached image files that are stored behind authenticated servers, which may require additional configuration when using the UI Library. To learn more about this, see the storybook page for [Teams Inline Image](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/examples-teamsinterop-inlineimage--inline-image#inline-images).

\*Certain GIF images might not be supported by the UI library at this time. The user might receive a static image instead, and this is a known issue. In addition, the Web UI library doesn't support videos at this time.

The Web UI library currently supports the following file permissions:
  - "Anyone", and
  - "People you choose" (with email address)
  
The Teams user (sender) should be made aware that all other permissions (such as "People in your organization") aren't supported. The Teams user should double-check if the default permission is supported after uploading the file in their Teams client. In addition, The Teams admin could impose policies that limit or disable this feature entirely (such as having file sharing disabled or having certain permissions disabled).

\*Inline image and file attachment support are currently in public preview. Preview APIs and SDKs are provided without a service-level agreement. We recommend that you don't use them for production workloads. Some features might not be supported, or they might have constrained capabilities. For more information, review [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews.](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)

## Supported identities

To initialize a composite, and authenticate to the service, a user must have an Azure Communication Services identity. For more information, see [Authenticate to Azure Communication Services](../../authentication.md) and [Quickstart: Create and manage access tokens](../../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).


## Teams interoperability

For [Teams interoperability](../../teams-interop.md) scenarios, you can use UI Library composites to add a user to a Teams meeting via Communication Services. To enable Teams interoperability, use either the default features in the call composite or the chat composite, or use UI components to build a custom experience.

When you add both calling and chat to an application, it's important to remember that the chat client can't be initialized until the participant is admitted to the call. After the participant is admitted, the chat client can be initialized to join the meeting chat thread. The pattern is demonstrated in the following figure:

:::image type="content" source="../../media/teams-interop-pattern.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram that shows the Teams interoperability pattern for calling and chat.":::

If you use UI components to deliver Teams interoperability experiences, begin by using UI Library examples to create key pieces of the experience:

- [Lobby example](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/story/examples-teams-interop--lobby). A sample lobby where a participant can wait to be admitted to a call.
- [Compliance banner](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/story/examples-teams-interop--compliance-banner). A sample banner that shows the user if the call is being recorded.
- [Teams theme](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/story/examples-themes--teams). A sample theme that makes UI Library elements look like Microsoft Teams.

## Customization

Use UI Library patterns to modify components to match the look and feel of your application. Customization is a key difference between composites and UI components in Communication Services. Composites have fewer customization options for a simpler integration experience.

The following table compares composites and UI components for customization use cases:

| Use case                                            | Composites | UI components |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Use Fluent-based theming                                | X          | X             |
| Compose the experience layout                     |            | X             |
| Use CSS styling to modify style properties  |            | X             |
| Replace icons                               |            | X             |
| Modify the participant gallery layout          |            | X             |
| Modify the call control layout                 | X          | X             |
| Inject data models to modify user metadata | X          | X             |

## Observability

The state management architecture of UI Library is decoupled, so you can access stateful call and chat clients directly. You can hook into the stateful client to read the state, handle events, and override behavior to pass onto the UI components.

The following table compares composites and UI components for observability use cases:

| Use case                                  | Composites | UI components |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Access call and chat client state    | X          | X             |
| Access and handle client events | X          | X             |
| Access and handle UI events     | X          | X             |

## Recommended architecture

Initialize a composite and base component by using an Azure Communication Services access token. It's important to get access tokens from Communication Services through a trusted service that you manage. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create and manage access tokens](../../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md) and the [trusted service tutorial](../../../tutorials/trusted-service-tutorial.md).

:::image type="content" source="../../media/mobile-ui/ui-library-architecture.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram that shows the recommended UI Library architecture.":::

Call and chat client libraries must have the context for the call or chat they join. Like user access tokens, disseminate the context to clients by using your own trusted service.

The following table summarizes initialization and resource management functions that are required to add context to a client library:

| Contoso responsibilities                                 | UI Library responsibilities                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide an access token from Azure                          | Pass through the provided access token to initialize components       |
| Provide a refresh function                                 | Refresh the access token by using a developer-provided function          |
| Retrieve and pass join information for the call or chat          | Pass through call and chat information to initialize components |
| Retrieve and pass user information for any custom data model | Pass through a custom data model to components to render          |

## Platform support

| SDK    | Windows            | macOS                | Ubuntu   | Linux    | Android  | iOS        |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| UI SDK | Chrome\*, Microsoft Edge | Chrome\*, Safari\*\* | Chrome\* | Chrome\* | Chrome\* | Safari\*\* |

\* The current version of Chrome and the two preceding releases are supported.

\*\* Safari version 13.1 and later versions are supported. Outgoing video for Safari macOS isn't yet supported, but it's supported for iOS. Outgoing screen sharing is supported only on desktop iOS.

## Accessibility

Accessibility by design is a principle across Microsoft products. UI Library follows this principle, and all UI components are fully accessible.

## Localization

Localization is key to making products for users around the world and who speak different languages. UI Library provides default support for some languages and capabilities, including right-to-left languages. You can provide their own localization files to use with UI Library.
