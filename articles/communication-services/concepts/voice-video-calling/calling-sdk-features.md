# Calling SDK overview

The Calling SDK enables end-user devices to drive voice and video communication experiences. This page provides detailed descriptions of Calling features, including platform and browser support information. To get started right away, check out [Calling quickstarts](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/getting-started-with-calling.md) or [Calling hero sample](../../samples/calling-hero-sample.md).

Once you've started development, check out the [known issues page](../known-issues.md) to find bugs we're working on.

Key features of the Calling SDK:

- **Addressing** - Azure Communication Services provides generic [identities](../identity-model.md) that are used to address communication endpoints. Clients use these identities to authenticate to the service and communicate with each other. These identities are used in Calling APIs that provide clients visibility into who is connected to a call (the roster).
- **Encryption** - The Calling SDK encrypts traffic and prevents tampering on the wire.
- **Device Management and Media** - The Calling SDK provides facilities for binding to audio and video devices, encodes content for efficient transmission over the communications dataplane, and renders content to output devices and views that you specify. APIs are also provided for screen and application sharing.
- **PSTN** - The Calling SDK can initiate voice calls with the traditional publicly switched telephone network, [using phone numbers you acquire in the Azure portal](../../quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number.md) or programmatically.
- **Teams Meetings** - The Calling SDK can [join Teams meetings](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-teams-interop.md) and interact with the Teams voice and video dataplane.
- **Notifications** - The Calling SDK provides APIs allowing clients to be notified of an incoming call. In situations where your app isn't running in the foreground, patterns are available to [fire pop-up notifications](../notifications.md) ("toasts") to inform end-users of an incoming call.

## Detailed capabilities

1. The Share Screen capability can be achieved using Raw Media, if you want to learn, **how  to add Raw Media**, visit [the quickstart guide](../../quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-raw-media-access.md).
2. The Calling SDK doesn't have an explicit API, you need to use the OS (android & iOS) API to achieve it.

## UI Library

UI Library makes it easy for you to build modern communications user experiences using Azure Communication Services. It provides a library of production-ready UI components to drop into your application.

With this set of prebuilt controls, you can create beautiful designs using [the fluent UI SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/) components and audio/video communication experiences. If you want to learn more about the UI Library, you can visit [the overview site](../ui-library/ui-library-overview.md), where you find details about web and mobile platforms.

## Calling SDK streaming support

The Azure Communication Services Calling SDK supports the following streaming configurations:

| Limit                                                         | Web                         | Windows/Android/iOS        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Maximum # of outgoing local streams that can be sent simultaneously**     | 1 video and 1 screen sharing | 1 video + 1 screen sharing |
| **Maximum # of incoming remote streams that can be rendered simultaneously** | 4 videos + 1 screen sharing | 6 videos + 1 screen sharing |
| **Maximum # of incoming remote streams that can be rendered simultaneousl - Public preview WebSDK or greater [1.14.1](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/blob/master/releasenotes/acs-javascript-calling-library-release-notes.md#1141-beta1-2023-06-01)** | 9 videos + 1 screen sharing  |

While the Calling SDK don't enforce these limits, your users may experience performance degradation if they're exceeded.

## Calling SDK timeouts

The following timeouts apply to the Communication Services Calling SDKs:

| Action                                                                      | Timeout in seconds |

| Add or remove new modality from a call (Start/stop video or screen sharing) | 40                 |
| Call Transfer operation timeout                                             | 60                 |

## Maximum call duration

**The maximum call duration is 30 hours**, participants that reach the maximum call duration lifetime of 30 hours will be disconnected from the call.

## JavaScript Calling SDK support by OS and browser

The following table represents the set of supported browsers, which are currently available. **We support the most recent three major versions of the browser (most recent three minor versions for Safari)**  unless otherwise indicated.

| Platform     | Chrome | Safari | Edge  | Firefox |  Webview |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| Android      | ✔️      | ❌      | ✔️           | ❌      | ✔️ *    |
| iOS          | ✔️      | ✔️      | ❌           | ❌      | ✔️      |
| macOS        | ✔️      | ✔️      | ✔️           | ✔️      | ❌      |
| Windows      | ✔️      | ❌      | ✔️           | ✔️      | ❌      |
| Ubuntu/Linux | ✔️      | ❌      | ❌           | ❌      | ❌      |

- Outgoing Screen Sharing isn't supported on iOS or Android.
- Firefox support is in public preview.
- ACS only supports Android System WebView on Android, iOS WebView(WKWebView) in public preview. Other types of embedded browsers or WebView on other OS platforms aren't officially supported, for example, GeckoView, Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), Microsoft Edge WebView2.
Running JavaScript Calling SDK on these platforms isn't actively tested, it may or may not work.
- [An iOS app on Safari can't enumerate/select mic and speaker devices](../known-issues.md#enumerating-devices-isnt-possible-in-safari-when-the-application-runs-on-ios-or-ipados) (for example, Bluetooth); this issue is a limitation of the OS, and there's always only one device, OS controls default device selection.

## Android Calling SDK support

- Support for Android API Level 21 or Higher

- Support for Java 7 or higher

- Support for Android Studio 2.0

## iOS Calling SDK support

- Support for iOS 10.0+ at build time, and iOS 12.0+ at run time

- Xcode 12.0+

## Calling client - browser security model

### User WebRTC over HTTPS

WebRTC APIs like `getUserMedia` require that the app that calls these APIs is served over HTTPS.

For local development, you can use `http://localhost`.

### Embed the Communication Services Calling SDK in an iframe

A new [permissions policy (also called a feature policy)](https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions-policy-1/#iframe-allow-attribute) is available in various browsers. This policy affects calling scenarios by controlling how applications can access a device's camera and microphone through a cross-origin iframe element.

If you want to use an iframe to host part of the app from a different domain, you must add the `allow` attribute with the correct value to your iframe.

For example, this iframe allows both camera and microphone access:

```html
<iframe allow="camera *; microphone *">
```
