# User Facing Diagnostics
When working with calls in Azure Communication Services, you may encounter issues that affect your customers. To help with this, Azure Communication Services provides a feature called "User Facing Diagnostics" (UFD) that can be used to examine various properties of a call to determine what the issue might be. User Facing Diagnostics are events that are fired off that could indicate due to some underlying issue (poor network, user has their microphone muted) that a user might have a poor experience. After a User Facing Diagnostic is fired, you should consider giving feedback to an end-user that they might be having some underlying issue. However, the User Facing Diagnostic output is informational only, and the calling stack does not make any changes based on a User Facing Diagnostic being fired.

## Diagnostic values
The following user-facing diagnostics are available:

Most cases happen when user is on an Azure Communication Services call on a mobile device and a phone call comes in. In most cases, the operating system mutes the Azure Communication Services call so a user can answer the phone call. | When value is set to `True`, give visual notification to end user that their call was muted because a phone call came in.

| cameraFreeze              | Camera stops producing frames for more than 5 seconds. | - Set to `True` when the local video stream is frozen. This diagnostic means that the remote side is seeing your video frozen on their screen or it means that the remote participants are not rendering your video on their screen. <br/> - Set to `False` when the freeze ends and users can see your video as per normal. | The Camera was lost during the call or bad network caused the camera to freeze. | When value is set to `True`, consider giving notification to end user that the remote participant network might be bad - possibly suggest that they turn off their camera to conserve bandwidth.
