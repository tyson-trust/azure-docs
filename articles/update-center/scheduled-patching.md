# Schedule recurring updates for machines using Azure portal and Azure Policy

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: On-premises environment :heavy_check_mark: Azure Arc-enabled servers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - For a seamless scheduled patching experience, we recommend that for all Azure VMs, you update the patch orchestration to **Customer Managed Schedules (Preview)** by **30th June 2023**. If you fail to update the patch orchestration by **30th June 2023**, you can experience a disruption in business continuity because the schedules will fail to patch the VMs.[Learn more](prerequsite-for-schedule-patching.md).


You can use update management center (preview) in Azure to create and save recurring deployment schedules. You can create a schedule on a daily, weekly or hourly cadence, specify the machines that must be updated as part of the schedule, and the updates to be installed. This schedule will then automatically install the updates as per the created schedule for single VM and at scale.

Update management center (preview) uses maintenance control schedule instead of creating its own schedules. Maintenance control enables customers to manage platform updates. For more information, see [Maintenance control documentation](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-control).

## Prerequisites for scheduled patching

1. See [Prerequisites for Update management center (preview)](./overview.md#prerequisites)
1. Patch orchestration of the Azure machines should be set to **Customer Managed Schedules (Preview)**. For more information, see [how to enable schedule patching on existing VMs](prerequsite-for-schedule-patching.md#enable-schedule-patching-on-azure-vms). For Azure Arc-enabled machines, it isn't a requirement.

	> [!Note]
	> If you set the patch mode to Azure orchestrated (AutomaticByPlatform) but do not enable the **BypassPlatformSafetyChecksOnUserSchedule** flag and do not attach a maintenance configuration to an Azure machine, it is treated as [Automatic Guest patching](../virtual-machines/automatic-vm-guest-patching.md) enabled machine and Azure platform will automatically install updates as per its own schedule. [Learn more](./overview.md#prerequisites).

## Schedule patching in an availability set

1. All VMs in a common [availability set](../virtual-machines/availability-set-overview.md) aren't updated concurrently.
1. VMs in a common availability set are updated within Update Domain boundaries and, VMs across multiple Update Domains aren't updated concurrently.

## Configure reboot settings

The registry keys listed in [Configuring Automatic Updates by editing the registry](/windows/deployment/update/waas-wu-settings#configuring-automatic-updates-by-editing-the-registry) and [Registry keys used to manage restart](/windows/deployment/update/waas-restart#registry-keys-used-to-manage-restart) can cause your machines to reboot, even if you specify **Never Reboot** in the **Schedule** settings. Configure these registry keys to best suit your environment.

## Service limits

The following are the recommended limits for the mentioned indicators:

| Indicator    | Limit          |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Number of schedules per Subscription per Region     | 250  |
| Total number of Resource associations to a schedule | 3000 |
| Resource associations on each dynamic scope    | 1000 |
| Number of dynamic scopes per Resource Group or Subscription per Region     | 250  |


## Schedule recurring updates on single VM

>[!NOTE]
> You can schedule updates from the Overview or Machines blade in update management center (preview) page or from the selected VM.

# [From Overview blade](#tab/schedule-updates-single-overview)

To schedule recurring updates on a single VM, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In **Update management center (preview)**, **Overview**, select your **Subscription**, and select **Schedule updates**.

1. In **Create new maintenance configuration**, you can create a schedule for a single VM.

	> [!Note] 
	> Currently, VMs and maintenance configuration in the same subscription are supported.

1. In the **Basics** page, select **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and all options in **Instance details**.
    - Select the **Maintenance scope** as *Guest (Azure VM, Arc-enabled VMs/servers)*.
	- Select **Add a schedule** and in **Add/Modify schedule**, specify the schedule details such as:
	
		- Start on
		- Maintenance window (in hours)
		> [!NOTE]
        > The upper maintenance window is 3 hours 55 mins.
		- Repeats (monthly, daily or weekly)
		- Add end date
		- Schedule summary

	> [!NOTE]
	> The hourly option is currently not supported in the portal, but can be used through the [API](./manage-vms-programmatically.md#create-a-maintenance-configuration-schedule). 

	:::image type="content" source="./media/scheduled-updates/scheduled-patching-basics-page.png" alt-text="Scheduled patching basics page.":::
 
	
	For the Repeats-monthly, there are two options: 

	- Repeat on a calendar date (optionally run on last date of the month)
	- Repeat on nth (first, second, etc.) x day (for example, Monday, Tuesday) of the month. You can also specify an offset from the day set. It could be +6/-6. For example, for customers who want to patch on the first Saturday after a patch on Tuesday, they would set the recurrence as the second Tuesday of the month with a +4 day offset. Optionally you can also specify an end date when you want the schedule to expire.

1. In the **Machines** page, select your machine and select **Next** to continue.

1. In the **Updates** page, specify the updates to include in the deployment such as update classification(s) or KB ID/ packages that must be installed when you trigger your schedule.

## Onboarding to Schedule using Policy

The update management center (preview) allows you to target a group of Azure or non-Azure VMs for update deployment via Azure Policy. The grouping using policy, keeps you from having to edit your deployment to update machines. You can use subscription, resource group, tags or regions to define the scope and use this feature for the built-in policies which you can customize as per your use-case.

> [!NOTE]
> This policy also ensures that the patch orchestration property for Azure machines is set to **Customer Managed Schedules (Preview)** as it is a prerequisite for scheduled patching. 


### Assign a policy

Policy allows you to assign standards and assess compliance at scale. [Learn more](../governance/policy/overview.md). To assign a policy to scope, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Policy**.
1. In **Assignments**, select **Assign policy**.
1. Under **Basics**, in the **Assign policy** page:
	- In **Scope**, choose your subscription, resource group, and choose **Select**.
	- Select **Policy definition** to view a list of policies.
	- In **Available Definitions**, select **Built in** for Type and in search, enter - *[Preview] Schedule recurring updates using Update Management Center* and click **Select**.

	:::image type="content" source="./media/scheduled-updates/dynamic-scoping-defintion.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows on how to select the definition.":::
	
	- Ensure that **Policy enforcement** is set to **Enabled** and select **Next**.
1. In **Parameters**, by default, only the Maintenance configuration ARM ID is visible. 

	>[!NOTE]
	> If you do not specify any other parameters, all machines in the subscription and resource group that you selected in **Basics** will be covered under scope. However, if you want to scope further based on resource group, location, OS, tags and so on, deselect **Only show parameters that need input or review** to view all parameters.

	- Maintenance Configuration ARM ID: A mandatory parameter to be provided. It denotes the ARM ID of the schedule that you want to assign to the machines.
	- Resource groups: You can specify a resource group optionally if you want to scope it down to a resource group. By default, all resource groups within the subscription are selected.
	- Operating System types: You can select Windows or Linux. By default, both are preselected.
	- Machine locations: You can optionally specify the regions that you want to select. By default, all are selected.
	- Tags on machines: You can use tags to scope down further. By default, all are selected.
	- Tags operator: In case you have selected multiple tags, you can specify if you want the scope to be machines that have all the tags or machines which have any of those tags.

	:::image type="content" source="./media/scheduled-updates/dynamic-scoping-assign-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows on how to assign a policy.":::

1. In **Remediation**, **Managed Identity**, **Type of Managed Identity**, select System assigned managed identity and **Permissions** is already set as *Contributor* according to the policy definition.

	>[!NOTE]
	> If you select Remediation, the policy would be effective on all the existing machines in the scope else, it is assigned to any new machine which is added to the scope.

1. In **Review + Create**, verify your selections, and select **Create** to identify the non-compliant resources to understand the compliance state of your environment.

### View Compliance

To view the current compliance state of your existing resources:

1. In **Policy Assignments**, select **Scope** to select your subscription and resource group.
1. In **Definition type**, select policy and in the list, select the assignment name.
1. Select **View compliance**. The Resource Compliance lists the machines and reasons for failure.

	:::image type="content" source="./media/scheduled-updates/dynamic-scoping-policy-compliance.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows on policy compliance.":::

## Check your scheduled patching run
You can check the deployment status and history of your maintenance configuration runs from the Update management center portal. Follow [Update deployment history by maintenance run ID](./manage-multiple-machines.md#update-deployment-history-by-maintenance-run-id).
