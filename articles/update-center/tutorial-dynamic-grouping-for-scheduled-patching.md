1. Select **Overview** > **Schedule updates** > **Create a maintenance configuration**.
1. In the **Create a maintenance configuration** page, enter the details in the **Basics** tab and select **Maintenance scope** as *Guest* (Azure VM, Arc-enabled VMs/servers).
1. Select **Dynamic Scopes** and follow the steps to [Add Dynamic scope](manage-dynamic-scoping.md#add-a-dynamic-scope-preview). 
1. In **Machines** tab, select **Add machines** to add any individual machines to the maintenance configuration and select **Updates**.
1. In the **Updates** tab, select the patch classification that you want to include/exclude and select **Tags**.
1. Provide the tags in **Tags** tab.
1. Select  **Review** and then **Review + Create**.
