# Microsoft Sentinel UEBA reference

This reference article lists the input data sources for the User and Entity Behavior Analytics service in Microsoft Sentinel. It also describes the enrichments that UEBA adds to entities, providing needed context to alerts and incidents.

## UEBA data sources

These are the data sources from which the UEBA engine collects and analyzes data to train its ML models and set behavioral baselines for users, devices, and other entities. UEBA then looks at data from these sources to find anomalies and glean insights.

| Data source | Events |
| ----------- | ------ |
| **Azure Active Directory**<br>Sign-in logs | All |
| **Azure Active Directory**<br>Audit logs | ApplicationManagement<br>DirectoryManagement<br>GroupManagement<br>Device<br>RoleManagement<br>UserManagementCategory |
| **Azure Activity logs** | Authorization<br>AzureActiveDirectory<br>Billing<br>Compute<br>Consumption<br>KeyVault<br>Devices<br>Network<br>Resources<br>Intune<br>Logic<br>Sql<br>Storage |
| **Windows Security events**<br>*WindowsEvent* or<br>*SecurityEvent* | 4624: An account was successfully logged on<br>4625: An account failed to log on<br>4648: A logon was attempted using explicit credentials<br>4672: Special privileges assigned to new logon<br>4688: A new process has been created |

## UEBA enrichments

This section describes the enrichments UEBA adds to Microsoft Sentinel entities, along with all their details, that you can use to focus and sharpen your security incident investigations. These enrichments are displayed on [entity pages](entity-pages.md#how-to-use-entity-pages) and can be found in the following Log Analytics tables, the contents and schema of which are listed below:

- The **BehaviorAnalytics** table is where UEBA's output information is stored.

    The following three dynamic fields from the BehaviorAnalytics table are described in the [entity enrichments dynamic fields](#entity-enrichments-dynamic-fields) section below.

    - The [UsersInsights](#usersinsights-field) and  [DevicesInsights](#devicesinsights-field) fields contain entity information from Active Directory / Azure AD and Microsoft Threat Intelligence sources.

    - The [ActivityInsights](#activityinsights-field) field contains entity information based on the behavioral profiles built by Microsoft Sentinel's entity behavior analytics. 

        <a name="baseline-explained"></a>User activities are analyzed against a baseline that is dynamically compiled each time it is used. Each activity has its defined lookback period from which the dynamic baseline is derived. The lookback period is specified in the [**Baseline**](#activityinsights-field) column in this table.

- The **IdentityInfo** table is where identity information synchronized to UEBA from Azure Active Directory (and from on-premises Active Directory via Microsoft Defender for Identity) is stored.

### IdentityInfo table

After you [enable UEBA](enable-entity-behavior-analytics.md) for your Microsoft Sentinel workspace, data from your Azure Active Directory is synchronized to the **IdentityInfo** table in Log Analytics for use in Microsoft Sentinel. You can embed user data synchronized from your Azure AD in your analytics rules to enhance your analytics to fit your use cases and reduce false positives.

While the initial synchronization may take a few days, once the data is fully synchronized:

- Changes made to your user profiles in Azure AD are updated in the **IdentityInfo** table within 15 minutes.

- Group and role information is synchronized between the **IdentityInfo** table and Azure AD daily.

- Every 14 days, Microsoft Sentinel re-synchronizes with your entire Azure AD to ensure that stale records are fully updated.

- Default retention time in the **IdentityInfo** table is 30 days.


> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only built-in roles are supported.
>
> Data about deleted groups, where a user was removed from a group, is not currently supported.

The following table describes the user identity data included in the **IdentityInfo** table in Log Analytics.
