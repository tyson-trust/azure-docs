# Threat intelligence integration in Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft Sentinel gives you a few different ways to [use threat intelligence feeds](work-with-threat-indicators.md) to enhance your security analysts' ability to detect and prioritize known threats. 

- Use one of many available integrated [threat intelligence platform (TIP) products](connect-threat-intelligence-tip.md).
- [Connect to TAXII servers](connect-threat-intelligence-taxii.md) to take advantage of any STIX-compatible threat intelligence source.
- Connect directly to the [Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence](connect-mdti-data-connector.md) feed.
- Make use of any custom solutions that can communicate directly with the [Microsoft Graph Security tiIndicators API](/graph/api/resources/tiindicator). 
- You can also connect to threat intelligence sources from playbooks, in order to enrich incidents with TI information that can help direct investigation and response actions.

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple workspaces in the same tenant, such as for [Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)](mssp-protect-intellectual-property.md), it may be more cost effective to connect threat indicators only to the centralized workspace.
>
> When you have the same set of threat indicators imported into each separate workspace, you can run cross-workspace queries to aggregate threat indicators across your workspaces. Correlate them within your MSSP incident detection, investigation, and hunting experience.
