## Deploy the security content from the content hub

Deploy the [SAP security content](sap-solution-security-content.md) from the Microsoft Sentinel **Content hub** and **Watchlists** areas.

Deploying the **Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications** causes the Microsoft Sentinel for SAP data connector to be displayed in the Microsoft Sentinel **Data connectors** area. The solution also deploys the **SAP - System Applications and Products** workbook and SAP-related analytics rules.

To deploy SAP solution security content, do the following:

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, on the left pane, select **Content hub (Preview)**.

    The **Content hub (Preview)** page displays a filtered, searchable list of solutions.

1. To open the SAP solution page, select **Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications**.

1. To launch the solution deployment wizard, select **Create**, and then enter the details of the Azure subscription and resource group.

1. For the **Deployment target workspace**, select the Log Analytics workspace (the one used by Microsoft Sentinel) where you want to deploy the solution. <a id="multi-workspace"></a>

1. If you want to [work with the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications across multiple workspaces](cross-workspace.md) (PREVIEW), do one of the following, select **Some of the data is on a different workspace**.
    1. Under **Configure the workspace where the SOC data resides in**, select the SOC subscription and workspace. 
    1. Under **Configure the workspace where the SAP data resides in**, select the SAP subscription and workspace.

    For example:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-multi-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of how to configure the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications to work across multiple workspaces.":::

    > [!Note]
    > If you want the SAP and SOC data to be kept on the same workspace with no additional access controls, do not select **Some of the data is on a different workspace**. If you want the SOC and SAP data to be kept on the same workspace, but to apply additional access controls, review [this scenario](cross-workspace.md#scenario-2-sap-data-is-kept-in-the-soc-workspace).      

1. Select **Next** to cycle through the **Data Connectors**, **Analytics**, and **Workbooks** tabs, where you can learn about the components that will be deployed with this solution.

    For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications: security content reference](sap-solution-security-content.md).

1. On the **Review + create tab** pane, wait for the **Validation Passed** message, then select **Create** to deploy the solution.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can also select **Download a template** for a link to deploy the solution as code.

1. After the deployment is completed, a confirmation message appears at the upper right.

    To display the newly deployed content, go to:

    - **Threat Management** > **Workbooks** > **My workbooks**, to find the [built-in SAP workbooks](sap-solution-security-content.md#built-in-workbooks).
    - **Configuration** > **Analytics** to find a series of [SAP-related analytics rules](sap-solution-security-content.md#built-in-analytics-rules).

1. In Microsoft Sentinel, go to the **Microsoft Sentinel for SAP** data connector to confirm the connection:

    SAP ABAP logs are displayed on the Microsoft Sentinel **Logs** page, under **Custom logs**:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-logs-in-sentinel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the SAP ABAP logs in the 'Custom Logs' area in Microsoft Sentinel." lightbox="media/deploy-sap-security-content/sap-logs-in-sentinel.png":::

    For more information, see [Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications solution logs reference](sap-solution-log-reference.md).
