# Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications - SAP -Security Audit log and Initial Access workbook

This article describes the SAP -Security Audit log and Initial Access workbook, used for monitoring and tracking user audit activity across your SAP systems. You can use the workbook to get a bird's eye view of user audit activity, to better secure your SAP systems and gain quick visibility into suspicious actions. You can drill down into suspicious events as needed.

You can use the workbook either for ongoing monitoring of your SAP systems, or to review the systems following a security incident or other suspicious activity. 

## Start using the workbook

1. From the Microsoft Sentinel portal, select **Workbooks** from the **Threat management** menu.

1. In the **Workbooks** gallery, go to **Templates** and enter *SAP* in the search bar, and select **SAP -Security Audit log and Initial Access** from among the results.

1. Select **View template** to use the workbook as is, or select **Save** to create an editable copy of the workbook. When the copy is created, select **View saved workbook**.

     > [!IMPORTANT]
     >
     > The SAP -Security Audit log and Initial Access workbook is hosted by the workspace where the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications were installed. By default, both the SAP and the SOC data is assumed to be on the workspace that hosts the workbook. 
     >
     > If the SOC data is on a different workspace than the workspace hosting the workbook, make sure to include the subscription for that workspace, and select the SOC workspace from **Azure audit and activity workspace**. 

1. Select the following fields to filter the data according to your needs:

    - **Time Range**. From four hours to 90 days.  
    - **System Roles**. The SAP system roles, for example: Development.
    - **System Usage**. For example: SAP GTS.
    - **SAP systems**. You can select all systems, a specific system, or select multiple systems.

    If you select systems that aren't configured in the ["SAP systems" watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists), the workbook shows an error, specifying the systems with issues. In this case, [configure the watchlist](deployment-solution-configuration.md#configure-watchlists) to correctly include these systems.

## Workbook overview

The workbook is separated into two tabs:

- [**Logon analysis report**](#logon-analysis-report-tab). Shows different types of data regarding sign-in failures. Data includes anomalous data, Azure Active Directory data, and more. The data is based on the ["SAP systems" watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists).
- [**Audit log alerts report**](#audit-log-alerts-report-tab). Shows different types of data regarding the SAP Audit log events that the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications watches. The data is based on the ["SAP_Dynamic_Audit_Log_Monitor_Configuration" watchlist](sap-solution-security-content.md#available-watchlists).

## Logon analysis report tab

Includes the [Logon Analysis](#logon-analysis) and [Logon failures](#logon-failures---anomaly-detection) areas.

### Logon Analysis

Shows different types of data regarding user sign-ins.

:::image type="content" source="media/sap-audit-log-workbook/logon-analysis.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Logon Analysis area of the SAP Audit workbook." lightbox="media/sap-audit-log-workbook/logon-analysis.png":::

|Area  |Description  |Options |
|---------|---------|
|**Unique user logons per system**     |Shows the number of unique sign ins for each SAP system, and a graph with the sign-in trends over the selected time for each system. For example: the 012 system has 1.4-K unique logon attempts in the last 14 days, and in these 14 days the graph shows a relatively rising sign-in trend.         |
|**Logon types trend**     |Shows a trend of the number of sign ins according to type, for example, login via dialog. |You can hover over the graph to show the number of logons for different dates.         |
|**Logon failures Vs. success by unique users - trend**     |Shows a trend of successful and failed sign ins in the selected period. |You can hover over the graph to show the amount of successful and failed sign ins for different dates.         |

### Logon failures - anomaly detection

The areas under **Anomaly detection - filtering out noisy failed login attempts** show login failure data for SAP systems and users. To see only data flagged by [anomaly detection](configure-audit-log-rules.md#anomaly-detection), select **Anomalous only** next to **Failed logons** on the right.

|Area  |Description  |Specific data |Options/notes |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Logon failure rate** > **Logon failure anomalies** > **Unique User failed logons per SAP system** | Shows the number of unique failed sign ins for each SAP system. | | |
|**SAP and Active Directory are better together** | The **Anomalous login failures** table shows a combination of Microsoft Sentinel and Azure Active Directory data. The workbook displays the users according to risk: Users that indicate the most risk are at the top of the list, and the users with less security risk are at the bottom. |For each user, shows:<br>• A timeline of failed sign-in attempts<br>• A timeline showing at which point an anomalous failed attempt occurred<br>• The type of anomaly<br>• The user's email address<br>• The Azure Active directory risk indicator<br>• The number of incidents and alerts in Microsoft Sentinel |• When you select a row, you can see a list of alerts and incidents for that user under **Incidents/alerts overview for user**. Below this list, you can also see of Azure Active Directory risk events under **Azure audit and signin risks for user**.<br>• If your Azure Active Directory data is in a different Log Analytics workspace, make sure you select the relevant subscriptions and workspaces at the top of the workbook, under **Azure audit and activities**. |
|**Logon failure rate per system** |Visually represents the selected SAP systems. |• For each system, shows the number of failures in the selected period<br>• Systems are grouped by type.<br>• The color of the system indicates the number of failed attempts: Green indicates a few suspicious logon attempts, where red indicates more suspicious logon attempts. |You can select a system to see a list of failed sign ins with details about the failures. |

In this screenshot, you can see the data shown when the first line is selected in the **Anomalous login failures** table. The specific alerts and incident URLs are shown in the **Incidents/alerts overview for user** table.

|**Login failure by type** | Shows a trend of the number of sign-in failures according to type, for example: the sign-in triggered a background job, or the sign-in was via HTTP. |
|**Login failure by method** | Shows a trend of the number of sign-in failures according to method, for example: SNC or a sign-in ticket. |

## Audit log alerts report tab

This tab shows severity and audit trends for each SAP system and user. All areas in this tab show data flagged by [anomaly detection](configure-audit-log-rules.md#anomaly-detection) only. For all events, select **All** next to **Failed logons** on the right.
