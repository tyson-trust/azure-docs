# Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications data reference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some components of the Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring for SAP solution are currently in PREVIEW. The [Azure Preview Supplemental Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include additional legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
>
> Some logs, noted below, are not sent to Microsoft Sentinel by default, but you can manually add them as needed. For more information, see [Define the SAP logs that are sent to Microsoft Sentinel](sap-solution-deploy-alternate.md#define-the-sap-logs-that-are-sent-to-microsoft-sentinel).

This article describes the functions, logs, and tables available as part of the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications and its data connector. It is intended for advanced SAP users.

## Functions available from the SAP solution

This section describes the [functions](../../azure-monitor/logs/functions.md) that are available in your workspace after you've deployed the Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications. Find these functions in the Microsoft Sentinel **Logs** page to use in your KQL queries, listed under **Workspace functions**.

Users are *strongly encouraged* to use the functions as the subjects of their analysis whenever possible, instead of the underlying logs or tables. These functions are intended to serve as the principal user interface to the data. They form the basis for all the built-in analytics rules and workbooks available to you out of the box. This allows for changes to be made to the data infrastructure beneath the functions, without breaking user-created content.

```kusto
SAPConnectorOverview(7d)
| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), SystemID_s
```

### SAPUsersEmail

The **SAPUsersEmail** function allows for a performance oriented lookup of an SAP user's email address per SAP system and client, normally used to associate it with an active directory account. 
Using data extracted from SAP tables USR21 (User Name/Address Key Assignment) and ADR6 (E-Mail Addresses), the SAPUsersEmail function looks for an Email address. In case one is not found, the user ID is returned instead of an Email address. This behavior ensures that SAP service accounts (such as DDIC), that often are not associated with an email addresses, will be logged as pseudo AD accounts, enabling some UEBA features, aiding in the investigation of incidents and hunting activities.

| Field           | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| ClientID | The SAP Client ID |
| SystemID | The SAP System ID  |
| User | The SAP User ID |
| Email | The Email address of the SAP User | 

### SAPSystems

The **SAPSystems** function is used to centrally present the per-system configuration made using the 'SAP - Systems' watchlist.

**Parameters:**

- SelectedSystems
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All Systems"
  - Used to filter specific SAP systems
- SelectedSystemRoles
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All System Roles"

### SAPAuditLogAnomalies

The **SAPAuditLogAnomalies** uses Sentinel's underlying Kusto database's built-in machine learning capabilities to help detect anomalous events observed on the SAP audit log.
Developed for the “SAP - (Experimental) Dynamic Anomaly based Audit Log Monitor Alerts” alert rule, this function was initially designed to alert on recent anomalies but it can also help to highlight historical anomalies (see examples below).

**Parameters:**

- LearningTime
  - Optional
  - Default Value: 14 days
  - Determines the timespan used for the model learning
- DetectingTime
  - Optional
  - Default value: One hour
  - Determines the timespan to be looked at for detecting anomalies. Calling this function with DetectingTime = 0h will highlight anomalies across the entire LearningTime timespan
- SelectedSystems
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All Systems"
  - Used to filter specific SAP systems to look at.
- SelectedSystemRoles
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All System Roles"
  - Determines the roles of the SAP Systems to be looked at (as defined in the "SAP - Systems" watchlist).
- SelectedSeverities
  - Optional
  - Default value: ["High", "Medium"]
  - Used to determine events to be looked at in terms of their severities. Severities per SAP audit log message ID and system role are defined in the "SAP_Dynamic_Audit_Log_Monitor_Configuration" watchlist. 
- SelectedPrefixMask
  - Optional
  - Default value: 24
  - Used to determine the subnet mask level used for learning and detecting.
- SelectedRuleTypes
  - Optional
  - Default value: "AnomaliesOnly"
  - Determines what events are relevant for detecting the anomalies on. Rule types per SAP audit log message ID and system role are defined in the "SAP_Dynamic_Audit_Log_Monitor_Configuration" watchlist.

#### Logic

The function learns the slice of the history defined by the different input parameters, at the user, network attributes, system, seasonality, and activity levels. It then judges events occurring within the last DetectingTime timespan according to what it has learned, applying thresholds and other configurable exclusion criteria obtained from the SAP audit log configuration watchlist. Once a sliding window of user activity was deemed anomalous, a second query returns the entire user activity as evidence supporting the decision.

#### Additional notes

As with any machine learning solution, this function performs better with time. Further adjustments can be made using local configuration.
It is advisable to restrict the size of the learned database to be under 100 million records using the many available input parameters.

Example: looking for anomalies for events of high severity that occurred within the past hour on production systems for event types which are marked as "AnomaliesOnly" in the "SAP_Dynamic_Audit_Log_Monitor_Configuration"

```kusto
SAPAuditLogAnomalies(LearningTime = 14d, DetectingTime=1h, SelectedSystemRoles= dynamic(["Production"]), 
SelectedSeverities= dynamic(["High"]), SelectedRuleTypes= dynamic(["AnomaliesOnly"]))
```

Example: Looking for all anomalies in the last 14 days in system "BIP"

```kusto
SAPAuditLogAnomalies(LearningTime = 14d, DetectingTime=0h, SelectedSystems= dynamic(["BIP"]))
```

| Field           | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| **Multiple fields from SAPAuditLog** | Key fields from the SAP Audit log |

| Score | the anomaly scores as produced by the anomaly model|

See [Built-in SAP analytics rules for monitoring the SAP audit log](sap-solution-security-content.md#monitoring-the-sap-audit-log) for more information.

### SAPAuditLogConfigRecommend
The **SAPAuditLogConfigRecommend** is a helper function designed to offer recommendations for the configuration of the [SAP - Dynamic Anomaly based Audit Log Monitor Alerts (PREVIEW)](sap-solution-security-content.md#sap---dynamic-anomaly-based-audit-log-monitor-alerts-preview) analytics rule. Learn how to [configure the rules](configure-audit-log-rules.md).

### SAPUsersGetVIP

The Sentinel for SAP solution uses a concept of central user tagging, designed to allow for lower false positive rate with minimal effort on the customer end:

- Users can be tagged using the "SAP User Config" watchlist (for example DDIC is assigned with “RunObsoleteProgOK”). Multiple users can have multiple tags.
- An alert rule sends the relevant tags to the **SAPUsersGetVIP** function asking for a list of users to be excluded. The alert rule “SAP - Execution of an Obsolete or an Insecure Program” can ask for users bearing the tag “RunObsoleteProgOK”. 

Here is a KQL query demonstrating the use case described below:

```kusto
// Execution of Obsolete/Insecure Program
let ObsoletePrograms = _GetWatchlist("SAP - Obsolete Programs");
// here you can exclude system users which are OK to run obsolete/ sensitive programs
// by adding those users in the SAP_User_Config watchlist with a tag of 'RunObsoleteProgOK'
let excludeUsersTags= dynamic(['RunObsoleteProgOK']);
let excludedUsers= SAPUsersGetVIP(SearchForTags= dynamic(["RunObsoleteProgOK"]))| summarize by User2Exclude=SAPUser;
// Query logic
SAPAuditLog 
| where MessageID == 'AUW'
| where ABAPProgramName in (ObsoletePrograms) // The program is obsolete
| join kind=leftantisemi excludedUsers on $left.User == $right.User2Exclude
```

This functionality is heavily used in the Deterministic and Anomalous Audit Log Monitor Alerts, 'where tags can be associated with SAP audit log message ID, and can also be easily extended to custom alert rules. 
**Parameters:**

- SearchForTags
  - Optional
  - Default value: dynamic('All Tags')
  - When SearchForTags equals 'All Tags', all users are returned along with their tags, else, only users bearing the tags specified in SearchForTags are returned. TagsIntersect will show which tags were found, and IntersectionSize will hold the count of those.
- SpecialFocusTags
  - Optional
  - Default value: "Do not return any in-focus users"
  - The function returns all users bearing the tags specified in SpecialFocusTags, and marked those with specialFocusTagged = true.

| Source | Field | Description | Notes  
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------  
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | SearchKey | Search Key |
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | SAPUser | The SAP User | OSS, DDIC  
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | Tags | string of tags assigned to user | RunObsoleteProgOK  
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | User's Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Object ID | Azure AD Object ID |   
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | User Identifier | AD User Identifier |
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | User on-premises Sid |  |
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | User Principal Name |  |
| The "SAP User Config" watchlist | TagsList | A list of tags assigned to user | ChangeUserMasterDataOK;RunObsoleteProgOK  
| Logic | TagsIntersect | A set of tags that matched SearchForTags | ["ChangeUserMasterDataOK","RunObsoleteProgOK"]  
| Logic | SpecialFocusTagged | Special focus indication | True, False  
| Logic | IntersectionSize | The number of intersected Tags |

### SAPUsersHeader

The **SAPUsersHeader** function is designed to provide a high-level view of the SAP user. It uses data extracted from both the SAP user master data tables and recent activity on the SAP audit log to gather Email and IP addresses. It then returns last known email and IP addresses along with primary email and IP addresses.
**Parameters:**
SelectedSystemRoles:dynamic = dynamic(["All System Roles"]) SelectedSystems:dynamic = dynamic(["All Systems"]) SelectedUsers:dynamic = dynamic(["All Users"]) SelectedUser:string = "All Users"

- SelectedSystems
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All Systems"
  - Used to filter specific SAP systems to look at.
- SelectedSystemRoles
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All System Roles"
  - Determines the roles of the SAP Systems to be looked at (as defined in the "SAP - Systems" watchlist).
- SelectedUsers
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All Users"
  - Can input lists of users.
- SelectedUser
  - Optional
  - Default value: "All Users"
  - Accepts a single user only

#### Additional notes
For performance considerations, only a few days of audit activity are considered.

## Tables retrieved directly from SAP systems

This section lists the data tables that are retrieved directly from the SAP system and ingested into Microsoft Sentinel exactly as they are. 

To have the data from these tables ingested into Microsoft Sentinel, configure the relevant settings in the **systemconfig.ini** file. For more information, see [Configuring User Master data collection](sap-solution-deploy-alternate.md#configuring-user-master-data-collection).

The data retrieved from these tables provides a clear view of the authorization structure, group membership, and user profiles. It also allows you to track the process of authorization grants and revokes, and identify and govern the risks associated with those processes.

The tables listed below are required to enable functions that identify privileged users, map users to roles, groups, and authorizations.

For best results, refer to these tables using the name in the **Sentinel function name** column below:

| Table name | Table description                              | Sentinel function name |
