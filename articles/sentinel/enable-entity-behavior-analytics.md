# Enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) in Microsoft Sentinel 

In the previous deployment step, you enabled the Microsoft Sentinel security content you need to protect your systems. In this article, you learn how to enable and use the UEBA feature to streamline the analysis process. 

As Microsoft Sentinel collects logs and alerts from all of its connected data sources, it analyzes them and builds baseline behavioral profiles of your organizationâ€™s entities (such as users, hosts, IP addresses, and applications) across time and peer group horizon. Using a variety of techniques and machine learning capabilities, Microsoft Sentinel can then identify anomalous activity and help you determine if an asset has been compromised. Learn more about [UEBA](identify-threats-with-entity-behavior-analytics.md).

[!INCLUDE [reference-to-feature-availability](includes/reference-to-feature-availability.md)]

## Prerequisites

To enable or disable this feature (these prerequisites are not required to use the feature):

- Your user must be assigned the **Global Administrator** or **Security Administrator** roles in Azure AD.

- Your user must be assigned at least one of the following **Azure roles** ([Learn more about Azure RBAC](roles.md)):
    - **Microsoft Sentinel Contributor** at the workspace or resource group levels.
    - **Log Analytics Contributor** at the resource group or subscription levels.

- Your workspace must not have any Azure resource locks applied to it. [Learn more about Azure resource locking](../azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - No special license is required to add UEBA functionality to Microsoft Sentinel, and there's no additional cost for using it.
> - However, since UEBA generates new data and stores it in new tables that UEBA creates in your Log Analytics workspace, **additional data storage charges** will apply. 

## How to enable User and Entity Behavior Analytics

1. Go to the **Entity behavior configuration** page. There are three ways to get to this page:

    - Select **Entity behavior** from the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, then select **Entity behavior settings** from the top menu bar.

    - Select **Settings** from the Microsoft Sentinel navigation menu, select the **Settings** tab, then under the **Entity behavior analytics** expander, select **Set UEBA**.

    - From the Microsoft 365 Defender data connector page, select the **Go the UEBA configuration page** link.

1. On the **Entity behavior configuration** page, switch the toggle to **On**.

1. Mark the check boxes next to the Active Directory source types from which you want to synchronize user entities with Microsoft Sentinel.

    - **Active Directory** on-premises (Preview)
    - **Azure Active Directory**

    To sync user entities from on-premises Active Directory, your Azure tenant must be onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Identity (either standalone or as part of Microsoft 365 Defender) and you must have the MDI sensor installed on your Active Directory domain controller. See [Microsoft Defender for Identity prerequisites](/defender-for-identity/prerequisites) for more information.

1. Mark the check boxes next to the data sources on which you want to enable UEBA.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > Below the list of existing data sources, you will see a list of UEBA-supported data sources that you have not yet connected. 
    >
    > Once you have enabled UEBA, you will have the option, when connecting new data sources, to enable them for UEBA directly from the data connector pane if they are UEBA-capable.

1. Select **Apply**. If you accessed this page through the **Entity behavior** page, you will be returned there.
