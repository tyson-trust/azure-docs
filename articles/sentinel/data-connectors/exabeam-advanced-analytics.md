## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias ------- and load the function code, on the second line of the query, enter the hostname(s) of your ---------- device(s) and any other unique identifiers for the logstream. The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.


> [!NOTE]
   >  This data connector has been developed using Exabeam Advanced Analytics i54 (Syslog)

1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux or Windows

Install the agent on the server where the Exabeam Advanced Analytic logs are generated or forwarded.

> Logs from Exabeam Advanced Analytic deployed on Linux or Windows servers are collected by **Linux** or **Windows** agents.




2. Configure the logs to be collected
