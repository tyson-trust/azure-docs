## Prerequisites

To integrate with Pulse Connect Secure make sure you have: 

- **Pulse Connect Secure**: must be configured to export logs via Syslog


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias Pulse Connect Secure and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/Pulse%20Connect%20Secure/Parsers/PulseConnectSecure.txt), on the second line of the query, enter the hostname(s) of your Pulse Connect Secure device(s) and any other unique identifiers for the logstream. The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.

1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux

Typically, you should install the agent on a different computer from the one on which the logs are generated.

>  Syslog logs are collected only from **Linux** agents.


2. Configure the logs to be collected

Configure the facilities you want to collect and their severities.
 1. Under workspace advanced settings **Configuration**, select **Data** and then **Syslog**.
 2. Select **Apply below configuration to my machines** and select the facilities and severities.
 3.  Click **Save**.


3. Configure and connect the Pulse Connect Secure

[Follow the instructions](https://docs.pulsesecure.net/WebHelp/Content/PCS/PCS_AdminGuide_8.2/Configuring%20Syslog.htm) to enable syslog streaming of Pulse Connect Secure logs. Use the IP address or hostname for the Linux device with the Linux agent installed as the Destination IP address.
