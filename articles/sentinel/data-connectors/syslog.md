# Syslog connector for Microsoft Sentinel

Syslog is an event logging protocol that is common to Linux. Applications will send messages that may be stored on the local machine or delivered to a Syslog collector. When the Agent for Linux is installed, it configures the local Syslog daemon to forward messages to the agent. The agent then sends the message to the workspace. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2223807&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).
