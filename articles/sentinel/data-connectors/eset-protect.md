# ESET PROTECT connector for Microsoft Sentinel

This connector gathers all events generated by ESET software through the central management solution ESET PROTECT (formerly ESET Security Management Center). This includes Anti-Virus detections, Firewall detections but also more advanced EDR detections. For a complete list of events please refer to [the documentation](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/events-exported-to-json-format.html).

## Connector attributes

| Connector attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Log Analytics table(s)** | Syslog (ESETPROTECT)<br/> |
| **Data collection rules support** | [Workspace transform DCR](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/tutorial-workspace-transformations-portal) |
| **Supported by** | [ESET Netherlands](https://techcenter.eset.nl/en/) |

## Query samples

**ESET threat events**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Threat_Event'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

**Top 10 detected threats**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Threat_Event'

   | summarize ThreatCount = count() by tostring(ThreatName)

   | top 10 by ThreatCount
   ```

**ESET firewall events**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'FirewallAggregated_Event'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

**ESET threat events**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Threat_Event'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

**ESET threat events from Real-time file system protection**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Threat_Event'

   | where ScanId == 'Real-time file system protection'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

**Query ESET threat events from On-demand scanner**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Threat_Event'

   | where ScanId == 'On-demand scanner'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

**Top hosts by number of threat events**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Threat_Event'

   | summarize threat_events_count = count() by HostName

   | sort by threat_events_count desc
   ```

**ESET web sites filter**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'FilteredWebsites_Event'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```

**ESET audit events**
   ```kusto
ESETPROTECT

   | where EventType == 'Audit_Event'

   | sort by TimeGenerated desc
   ```



## Vendor installation instructions


**NOTE:** This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias ESETPROTECT and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/ESETPROTECT/Parsers/ESETPROTECT.txt).The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.

1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux

Typically, you should install the agent on a different computer from the one on which the logs are generated.

>  Syslog logs are collected only from **Linux** agents.


2. Configure the logs to be collected

Configure the facilities you want to collect and their severities.

1.  Under workspace advanced settings **Configuration**, select **Data** and then **Syslog**.
2.  Select **Apply below configuration to my machines** and select the facilities and severities. The default ESET PROTECT facility is **user**.
3.  Click **Save**.


3. Configure ESET PROTECT

Configure ESET PROTECT to send all events through Syslog.

1.  Follow [these instructions](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/admin_server_settings_syslog.html) to configure syslog output. Make sure to select **BSD** as the format and **TCP** as the transport.

2.  Follow [these instructions](https://help.eset.com/protect_admin/latest/en-US/admin_server_settings_export_to_syslog.html) to export all logs to syslog. Select **JSON** as the output format.

Note:- Refer to the [documentation](/azure/sentinel/connect-log-forwarder?tabs=rsyslog#security-considerations) for setting up the log forwarder for both local and cloud storage.
