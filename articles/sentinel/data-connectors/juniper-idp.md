1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux or Windows

Install the agent on the Server.




2. Configure the logs to be collected

Follow the configuration steps below to get Juniper IDP logs into Microsoft Sentinel. This configuration enriches events generated by Juniper IDP module to provide visibility on log source information for Juniper IDP logs. Refer to the [Azure Monitor Documentation](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/data-sources-json) for more details on these steps.
1. Download config file [juniper_idp.conf](https://aka.ms/sentinel-JuniperIDP-conf).
2. Login to the server where you have installed Azure Log Analytics agent.
3. Copy juniper_idp.conf to the /etc/opt/microsoft/omsagent/**workspace_id**/conf/omsagent.d/ folder.
4. Edit juniper_idp.conf as follows:

	 i. change the listen port for receiving logs based on your configuration (line 3)

	 ii. replace **workspace_id** with real value of your Workspace ID (lines 58,59,60,63)
5. Save changes and restart the Azure Log Analytics agent for Linux service with the following command:
		sudo /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart
6. To configure a remote syslog destination, please reference the [SRX Getting Started - Configure System Logging](https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=kb16502).
