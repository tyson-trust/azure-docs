## Prerequisites

To integrate with Symantec ProxySG make sure you have: 

- **Symantec ProxySG**: must be configured to export logs via Syslog


## Vendor installation instructions


> [!NOTE]
   >  This data connector depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected which is deployed as part of the solution. To view the function code in Log Analytics, open Log Analytics/Microsoft Sentinel Logs blade, click Functions and search for the alias Symantec Proxy SG and load the function code or click [here](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Sentinel/blob/master/Solutions/SymantecProxySG/Parsers/SymantecProxySG/SymantecProxySG.txt), on the second line of the query, enter the hostname(s) of your Symantec Proxy SG device(s) and any other unique identifiers for the logstream. The function usually takes 10-15 minutes to activate after solution installation/update.

1. Install and onboard the agent for Linux

Typically, you should install the agent on a different computer from the one on which the logs are generated.

>  Syslog logs are collected only from **Linux** agents.


2. Configure the logs to be collected

Configure the facilities you want to collect and their severities.
 1. Under workspace advanced settings **Configuration**, select **Data** and then **Syslog**.
 2. Select **Apply below configuration to my machines** and select the facilities and severities.
 3.  Click **Save**.


3. Configure and connect the Symantec ProxySG

 
 1. Log in to the Blue Coat Management Console .
 2. Select Configuration > Access Logging > Formats.
 3. Select New.
 4.  Enter a unique name in the Format Name field.
 5. Click the radio button for  **Custom format string**  and paste the following string into the field.
 <p><code>date time time-taken c-ip cs-userdn cs-auth-groups x-exception-id sc-filter-result cs-categories cs(Referer) sc-status s-action cs-method rs(Content-Type) cs-uri-scheme cs-host cs-uri-port cs-uri-path cs-uri-query cs-uri-extension cs(User-Agent) s-ip sr-bytes rs-bytes x-virus-id x-bluecoat-application-name x-bluecoat-application-operation cs-uri-port x-cs-client-ip-country cs-threat-risk</code></p>
 6. Click the **OK** button. 
 7. Click the **Apply** button. 
 8. [Follow these instructions](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/166529/sending-access-logs-to-a-syslog-server.html) to enable syslog streaming of **Access** Logs. Use the IP address or hostname for the Linux device with the Linux agent installed as the Destination IP address
