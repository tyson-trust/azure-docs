# Set up multiple workspaces and tenants in Microsoft Sentinel

When you planned your deployment, you [determined whether a multiple workspace architecture is relevant for your environment](prepare-multiple-workspaces.md). If your environment requires multiple workspaces, you can now set them up as part of your deployment. In this article, you learn how to set up Microsoft Sentinel to extend across multiple workspaces and tenants.

## Options for using multiple workspaces

If you've determined and set up your environment to extend across workspaces, you can: 

- [Manage and monitor cross-workspace architecture](extend-sentinel-across-workspaces-tenants.md): Query and analyze your data across workspaces and tenants.
- [Manage multiple workspaces with workspace manager](workspace-manager.md): Centrally manage multiple workspaces within one or more Azure tenants.
