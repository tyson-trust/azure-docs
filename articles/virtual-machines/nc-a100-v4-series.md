#  NC A100 v4-series  

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The NC A100 v4 series virtual machine (VM) is a new addition to the Azure GPU family. You can use this series for real-world Azure Applied AI training and batch inference workloads. 

The NC A100 v4 series is powered by NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPU and 3rd-generation AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7V13 (Milan) processors.  The VMs feature up to 4 NVIDIA A100 PCIe GPUs with 80GB memory each, up to 96 non-multithreaded AMD EPYC Milan processor cores and 880 GiB of system memory. 
These VMs are ideal for real-world Applied AI workloads, such as: 

- GPU-accelerated analytics and databases
- Batch inferencing with heavy pre- and post-processing
- Autonomy model training
- Oil and gas reservoir simulation
- Machine learning (ML) development
- Video processing
- AI/ML web services



## Supported features

To get started with NC A100 v4 VMs, refer to [HPC Workload Configuration and Optimization](configure.md) for steps including driver and network configuration.

Due to increased GPU memory I/O footprint, the NC A100 v4 requires the use of [Generation 2 VMs](generation-2.md) and marketplace images. While the [Azure HPC images](configure.md) are strongly recommended, Azure HPC Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and Azure HPC CentOS 7.9, CentOS 8.4, RHEL 7.9, RHEL 8.5, Windows Service 2019, and Windows Service 2022 images are supported.

Note: The Ubuntu-HPC 18.04-ncv4 image is only valid during preview and deprecated on 7/29/2022.  All changes have been merged into standard Ubuntu-HPC 18.04 image. Please follow instruction [Azure HPC images](configure.md) for configuration.
