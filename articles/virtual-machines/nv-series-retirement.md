# Migrate your NV and NV_Promo series virtual machines by September 6, 2023
Weâ€™re happy to announce that we're extending the retirement date by one year to September 6, 2023, for the Azure NV-Series and NV_Promo Series virtual machine to give you more time to plan  your migration. 

We continue to bring modern and optimized virtual machine (VM) instances to Azure by using the latest innovations in datacenter technologies. As we innovate, we also thoughtfully plan how we retire aging hardware. With this context in mind, we're retiring our NV-series Azure VM sizes on September 6, 2023.

## How does the NV series migration affect me?

After September 6, 2023, any remaining NV and NV_Promo-size VMs remaining in your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These VMs will be stopped and removed from the host. These VMs will no longer be billed in the deallocated state.

The current VM size retirement only affects the VM sizes in the [NV series](nv-series.md). This retirement doesn't affect the [NVv3](nvv3-series.md) and [NVv4](nvv4-series.md) series VMs. 

## What actions should I take?

You'll need to resize or deallocate your NV VMs. We recommend moving your GPU visualizations or graphics workloads to another [GPU accelerated VM size](sizes-gpu.md).

[Learn more](nv-series-migration-guide.md) about migrating your workloads to other GPU Azure VM sizes.
