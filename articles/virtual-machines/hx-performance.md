# HX-series virtual machine performance

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

Performance expectations using common HPC microbenchmarks are as follows:

| Workload                                        | HX                                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| STREAM Triad                                    | 750-780GB/s of DDR5, up to 5.7 TB/s of 3D-V Cache bandwidth                                                    |
| High-Performance Linpack (HPL)                  | Up to 7.6 TF (Rpeak, FP64) for 144-core VM size                   |
| RDMA latency & bandwidth                        | < 2 microseconds (1 byte), 400 Gb/s (one-way)                     |
| FIO on local NVMe SSDs (RAID0)                  | 12 GB/s reads, 7 GB/s writes; 186k IOPS reads, 201k IOPS writes   |

## Memory bandwidth test

The STREAM memory test can be run using the scripts in this GitHub repository. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/woc-benchmarking 
cd woc-benchmarking/apps/hpc/stream/ 
sh build_stream.sh 
sh stream_run_script.sh $PWD “hbrs_v4” 
```
## Compute performance test 

The HPL benchmark can be run using the script in this GitHub repository. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/woc-benchmarking 
cd woc-benchmarking/apps/hpc/hpl 
sh hpl_build_script.sh 
sh hpl_run_scr_hbv4.sh $PWD 
```

## MPI latency

The MPI latency test from the OSU microbenchmark suite can be executed as shown. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azurehpc/tree/master/apps/health_checks).

```bash
module load mpi/hpcx 
mpirun -np 2 --host $src,$dst --map-by node -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH $HPCX_OSU_DIR/osu_latency
```

## MPI bandwidth
The MPI bandwidth test from the OSU microbenchmark suite can be executed as shown. Sample scripts are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azurehpc/tree/master/apps/health_checks).

```bash
module load mpi/hpcx 
mpirun -np 2 --host $src,$dst --map-by node -x LD_LIBRARY_PATH $HPCX_OSU_DIR/osu_bw
```

[!NOTE]
Define source(src) and destination(dst).

## Mellanox Perftest
The [Mellanox Perftest package](https://github.com/linux-rdma/perftest) has many InfiniBand tests such as latency (ib_send_lat) and bandwidth (ib_send_bw). An example command is shown.
```console
numactl --physcpubind=[INSERT CORE #]  ib_send_lat -a
```
[!NOTE]
NUMA node affinity for InfiniBand NIC is NUMA0.
