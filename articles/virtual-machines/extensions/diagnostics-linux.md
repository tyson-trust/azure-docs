# Use the Linux diagnostic extension 4.0 to monitor metrics and logs

This article describes the latest versions of the Linux diagnostic extension (LAD).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For information about version 3.x, see [Use the Linux diagnostic extension 3.0 to monitor metrics and logs](./diagnostics-linux-v3.md).
> For information about version 2.3 and earlier, see [Monitor the performance and diagnostic data of a Linux VM](/previous-versions/azure/virtual-machines/linux/classic/diagnostic-extension-v2).

The Linux diagnostic extension helps you monitor the health of a Linux VM on Microsoft Azure. It has the following capabilities:

| Data source | Customization options | Required destinations | Optional destinations |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Metrics     | [Counter, Aggregation, Sample Rate, Specifiers](#performancecounters) | Azure Table Storage | EventHub, Azure Blob Storage (JSON format), Azure Monitor (new in LAD 4.0) |
| Syslog      | [Facility, Severity Level](#syslogevents) | Azure Table Storage | EventHub, Azure Blob Storage (JSON Format) |
| Files       | [Log Path, Destination Table](#filelogs) | Azure Table Storage | EventHub, Azure Blob Storage (JSON Format) |

This extension works with both Azure deployment models: Azure Resource Manager and classic.

## Prerequisites

- **Azure Linux agent version 2.2.0 or later**. Most Azure VM Linux gallery images include version 2.2.7 or later. Run `/usr/sbin/waagent -version` to confirm the version installed on the VM. If the VM runs an older version of the guest agent, [update the Linux agent](./update-linux-agent.md).
- **Azure CLI**. [Set up the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) environment on your machine.
- **The `wget` command**. If you don't already have it, install it using the corresponding package manager.
- **An Azure subscription and general purpose storage account** to store the data.  General purpose storage accounts support table storage, which is required.  A blob storage account doesn't work.
- **Python 2**.

### Supported Linux distributions

See [Supported agent operating systems](../../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md#linux).

### Python requirement

The Linux diagnostic extension requires Python 2. If your virtual machine uses a distribution that doesn't include Python 2, install it.

> [!NOTE]
> We are currently planning to converge all versions of the Linux Diagnostic Extensions (LAD) with the new Azure Monitoring Agent, which already supports Python 3. The LAD will be scheduled for deprecation pending announcement and approval.
>

To install Python 2, run one of the following sample commands:

- Red Hat, CentOS, Oracle: `yum install -y python2`
- Ubuntu, Debian: `apt-get install -y python2`
- SUSE: `zypper install -y python2`

The `python2` executable file must be aliased to `python`.

1. Run the following command to remove any existing aliases.

   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --remove-all python
   ```

1. Run the following command to create the new alias.

   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 1
   ```

## Install the extension

You can enable this extension for your VM and Virtual Machine Scale Set by using the Azure PowerShell cmdlets, Azure CLI scripts, Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates), or the Azure portal. For more information, see [Virtual machine extensions and features for Linux](features-linux.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Some components of the Linux Diagnostic VM extension are also shipped in the [Log Analytics VM extension](./oms-linux.md). Conflicts can arise if both extensions are instantiated in the same ARM template.
>
>To avoid install-time conflicts, use the [`dependsOn` directive](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/resource-dependency.md#dependson) to install the extensions sequentially. The extensions can be installed in either order.

Use the installation instructions and a [downloadable sample configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions/master/Diagnostic/tests/lad_2_3_compatible_portal_pub_settings.json) to configure LAD 4.0 to:

- Capture and store the same metrics that LAD versions 2.3 and 3.x provided.
- Send metrics to the Azure Monitor sink along with the usual sink to Azure Storage. This functionality is new in LAD 4.0.
- Capture a useful set of file system metrics, as in LAD 3.0.
- Capture the default syslog collection enabled by LAD 2.3.
- Enable the Azure portal experience for charting and alerting on VM metrics.

The downloadable configuration is just an example. Modify it to suit your needs.

### Installation

You can install and configure LAD 4.0 in the Azure CLI or in Azure PowerShell.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azcli)

If your protected settings are in the file *ProtectedSettings.json* and your public configuration information is in *PublicSettings.json*, run this command:

```azurecli
az vm extension set --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics \
  --name LinuxDiagnostic --version 4.0 --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
  --vm-name <vm_name> --protected-settings ProtectedSettings.json \
  --settings PublicSettings.json
```

The command assumes that you're using the Azure Resource Management mode of the Azure CLI. To configure LAD for classic deployment model VMs, switch to Service Management mode (`azure config mode asm`) and omit the resource group name in the command.

For more information, see the [cross-platform CLI documentation](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

If your protected settings are in the `$protectedSettings` variable and your public configuration information is in the `$publicSettings` variable, run this command:

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name> -VMName <vm_name> `
  -Location <vm_location> -ExtensionType LinuxDiagnostic `
  -Publisher Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics -Name LinuxDiagnostic `
  -SettingString $publicSettings -ProtectedSettingString $protectedSettings `
  -TypeHandlerVersion 4.0
```

---

### Enable auto update 

To enable automatic update of the agent, we recommend that you enable the [Automatic Extension Upgrade](../../virtual-machines/automatic-extension-upgrade.md) feature:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azcli)

```azurecli
az vm extension set --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics --name LinuxDiagnostic \
  --version 4.0 --resource-group <resource_group_name> --vm-name <vm_name> \
  --protected-settings ProtectedSettings.json --settings PublicSettings.json \
  --enable-auto-upgrade true
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name> -VMName <vm_name> `
  -Location <vm_location> -ExtensionType LinuxDiagnostic `
  -Publisher Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics -Name LinuxDiagnostic `
  -SettingString $publicSettings -ProtectedSettingString $protectedSettings `
  -TypeHandlerVersion 4.0 -EnableAutomaticUpgrade $true
```

---

### Sample installation

In these examples, the sample configuration collects a set of standard data and sends it to table storage. The URL for the sample configuration and its contents can change.

> [!NOTE]
> For the following samples, fill in the appropriate values for the variables in the first section before you run the code.

In most cases, you should download a copy of the portal settings JSON file and customize it for your needs. Use templates or your own automation to use a customized version of the configuration file rather than downloading from the URL each time.

When you enable the new Azure Monitor sink, the VMs need to have system-assigned identity enabled to generate Managed Service Identity (MSI) authentication tokens. You can add these settings during or after VM creation. For instructions for the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, PowerShell, and Azure Resource Manager, see [Configure managed identities](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md).

  --version 4.0 --resource-group $my_resource_group --vmss-name $my_linux_vmss \
  --protected-settings "${my_lad_protected_settings}" --settings portal_public_settings.json
```

### Update the extension settings

After you change your protected or public settings, run the same command to deploy them to the VM. If any settings changed, the updates are sent to the extension. LAD reloads the configuration and restarts itself.

### Migrate from previous versions of the extension

The latest version of the extension is 4.0, *which is currently in public preview*. Older versions of 3.x are still supported. 2.x versions have been deprecated since July 31, 2018.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To migrate from 3.x to the newest version of the extension, uninstall the old extension. Then install version 4, which includes the updated configuration for system-assigned identity and sinks for sending metrics to the Azure Monitor sink.

When you install the new extension, enable automatic minor version upgrades:

- On Azure Resource Manager deployment model VMs, include `"autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true` in the VM deployment template.
- On classic deployment model VMs, specify version `4.*` if you're installing the extension through the Azure CLI or PowerShell.

You can use the same storage account you used for LAD 3.x.

## Protected settings

This set of configuration information contains sensitive information that should be protected from public view. It contains, for example, storage credentials. The settings are transmitted to the extension, which stores them in encrypted form.

```json
{
    "storageAccountName" : "the storage account to receive data",
    "storageAccountEndPoint": "the hostname suffix for the cloud for this account",
    "storageAccountSasToken": "SAS access token",
    "mdsdHttpProxy": "HTTP proxy settings",
    "sinksConfig": { ... }
}
```

| Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| storageAccountName | The name of the storage account in which the extension writes data. |
| storageAccountEndPoint | (Optional) The endpoint that identifies the cloud in which the storage account exists. If this setting is absent, by default, LAD uses the Azure public cloud, `https://core.windows.net`. To use a storage account in Azure Germany, Azure Government, or Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet, set this value as required. |
| storageAccountSasToken | An [Account SAS token](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/sas-update-account-sas-now-supports-all-storage-services/) for blob and table services (`ss='bt'`). This token applies to containers and objects (`srt='co'`). It grants add, create, list, update, and write permissions (`sp='acluw'`). Do *not* include the leading question-mark (?). |
| mdsdHttpProxy | (Optional) HTTP proxy information the extension needs to connect to the specified storage account and endpoint. |
| sinksConfig | (Optional) Details of alternative destinations to which metrics and events can be delivered. The following sections provide details about each data sink the extension supports. |

To get a SAS token within an ARM template, use the `listAccountSas` function. For an example template, see [List function example](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/template-functions-resource.md#list-example).

You can construct the required shared access signature token through the Azure portal:

1. Select the general-purpose storage account to which you want the extension to write.
1. In the menu on the left, under **Security + networking**, select **Shared access signature**.
1. Make the selections as previously described.
1. Select **Generate SAS and connection string**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/diagnostics-linux/make_sas.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Shared access signature page, which has the Generate SAS and connection string.":::

Copy the generated shared access signature into the `storageAccountSasToken` field. Remove the leading question mark (?).

### sinksConfig

> [!NOTE]
> Both public and protected settings have an optional `sinksConfig` section. The `sinksConfig` section in the *protected* settings only holds `EventHub` and `JsonBlob` sink configurations, due to the inclusion of secrets like `sasURL`s. `AzMonSink` sink configurations **cannot** be included in your protected settings.

```json
"sinksConfig": {
    "sink": [
        {
            "name": "sinkname",
            "type": "sinktype",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
},
```

The `sinksConfig` optional section defines more destinations to which the extension sends collected information. The `"sink"` array contains an object for each extra data sink. The `"type"` attribute determines the other attributes in the object.

| Element | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| name | A string used to refer to this sink elsewhere in the extension configuration. |
| type | The type of sink being defined. Determines the other values, if any, in instances of this type. |

The Linux diagnostic extension 4.0 supports two protected sink types: `EventHub` and `JsonBlob`.

#### EventHub sink

```json
"sink": [
    {
        "name": "sinkname",
        "type": "EventHub",
        "sasURL": "https SAS URL"
    },
    ...
]
```

The `"sasURL"` entry contains the full URL, including the shared access signature token, for the event hub to which data should be published. LAD requires a shared access signature to name a policy that enables the send claim. Here's an example:

- Create an Event Hubs namespace called `contosohub`.
- Create an event hub in the namespace called `syslogmsgs`.
- Create a shared access policy on the event hub named `writer` that enables the send claim.

If you create a SAS that's good until midnight UTC on January 1, 2018, the `sasURL` value might be like the following example.

```https
https://contosohub.servicebus.windows.net/syslogmsgs?sr=contosohub.servicebus.windows.net%2fsyslogmsgs&sig=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&se=1514764800&skn=writer
```

For more information about generating and retrieving information on SAS tokens for Event Hubs, see [Generate a SAS token](/rest/api/eventhub/generate-sas-token#powershell).

#### JsonBlob sink

```json
"sink": [
    {
        "name": "sinkname",
        "type": "JsonBlob"
    },
    ...
]
```

Data directed to a `JsonBlob` sink is stored in blobs in Azure Storage. Each instance of LAD creates a blob every hour for each sink name. Each blob always contains a syntactically valid JSON array of objects. New entries are atomically added to the array.

Blobs are stored in a container that has the same name as the sink. The Azure Storage rules for blob container names apply to the names of `JsonBlob` sinks. Names must have between 3 and 63 lowercase alphanumeric ASCII characters or dashes.

## Public settings

The public settings structure contains various blocks of settings that control the information that the extension collects. Each setting, except `ladCfg`, is optional. If you specify metric or syslog collection in `ladCfg`, you must also specify `StorageAccount`. You must specify the `sinksConfig` element to enable the Azure Monitor sink for metrics from LAD 4.0.

```json
{
    "ladCfg":  { ... },
    "fileLogs": { ... },
    "StorageAccount": "the storage account to receive data",
    "sinksConfig": { ... },
    "mdsdHttpProxy" : ""
}
```

| Element | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| StorageAccount | The name of the storage account in which the extension writes data. Must be the name specified in the [protected settings](#protected-settings). |
| mdsdHttpProxy | (Optional) The proxy specified in the [protected settings](#protected-settings). If the private value is set, it overrides the public value. Put proxy settings that contain a secret, such as a password, in the [protected settings](#protected-settings). |

The following sections provide details about the remaining elements.

### ladCfg

```json
"ladCfg": {
    "diagnosticMonitorConfiguration": {
        "eventVolume": "Medium",
        "metrics": { ... },
        "performanceCounters": { ... },
        "syslogEvents": { ... }
    },
    "sampleRateInSeconds": 15
}
```

The `ladCfg` structure controls the gathering of metrics and logs for delivery to the Azure Monitor Metrics service and to other data sinks. Specify either `performanceCounters` or `syslogEvents` or both. Also specify the `metrics` structure.

If you don't want to enable syslog or metrics collection, specify an empty structure for the `ladCfg` element:

```json
"ladCfg": {
    "diagnosticMonitorConfiguration": {}
}
```

| Element | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| eventVolume | (Optional) Controls the number of partitions created within the storage table. The value must be `"Large"`, `"Medium"`, or `"Small"`. The default value is `"Medium"`. |
| sampleRateInSeconds | (Optional) The default interval between the collection of raw, that is, unaggregated, metrics. The smallest supported sample rate is 15 seconds. The default is `15`. |

#### metrics

```json
"metrics": {
    "resourceId": "/subscriptions/...",
    "metricAggregation" : [
        { "scheduledTransferPeriod" : "PT1H" },
        { "scheduledTransferPeriod" : "PT5M" }
    ]
}
```

| Element | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| resourceId | The Azure Resource Manager resource ID of the VM or of the Virtual Machine Scale Set to which the VM belongs. Also specify this setting if the configuration uses any `JsonBlob` sink. |
| scheduledTransferPeriod | The frequency at which aggregate metrics are computed and transferred to Azure Monitor Metrics. The frequency is expressed as an IS 8601 time interval. The smallest transfer period is 60 seconds, that is, PT1M. Specify at least one `scheduledTransferPeriod`. |

Samples of the metrics specified in the `performanceCounters` section are collected every 15 seconds or at the sample rate explicitly defined for the counter. If multiple `scheduledTransferPeriod` frequencies appear, as in the example, each aggregation is computed independently.

#### performanceCounters

```json
"performanceCounters": {
    "sinks": "",
    "performanceCounterConfiguration": [
        {
            "type": "builtin",
            "class": "Processor",
            "counter": "PercentIdleTime",
            "counterSpecifier": "/builtin/Processor/PercentIdleTime",
            "condition": "IsAggregate=TRUE",
            "sampleRate": "PT15S",
            "unit": "Percent",
            "annotation": [
                {
                    "displayName" : "cpu idle time",
                    "locale" : "en-us"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The `performanceCounters` optional section controls the collection of metrics. Raw samples are aggregated for each [scheduledTransferPeriod](#metrics) to produce these values:

- Mean
- Minimum
- Maximum
- Last-collected value
- Count of raw samples used to compute the aggregate

| Element | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| sinks | (Optional) A comma-separated list of names of sinks to which LAD sends aggregated metric results. All aggregated metrics are published to each listed sink. For example, `"MyEventHubSink, MyJsonSink, MyAzMonSink"`. For more information, see [`sinksConfig` (protected settings)](#sinksconfig) and [`sinksConfig` (public settings)](#sinksconfig-1). |
| type | Identifies the actual provider of the metric. |
| class | Together with `"counter"`, identifies the specific metric within the provider's namespace. |
| counter | Together with `"class"`, identifies the specific metric within the provider's namespace. [See a list of available counters](#metrics-supported-by-the-builtin-provider). |
| counterSpecifier | Identifies the metric within the Azure Monitor Metrics namespace. |
| condition | (Optional) Selects an instance of the object to which the metric applies. Or selects the aggregation across all instances of that object. |
| sampleRate | The IS 8601 interval that sets the rate at which raw samples for this metric are collected. If the value isn't set, the value of [`sampleRateInSeconds`](#ladcfg) sets the collection interval. The shortest supported sample rate is 15 seconds (PT15S). |
| unit | Defines the unit for the metric. Should be one of these strings: `"Count"`, `"Bytes"`, `"Seconds"`, `"Percent"`, `"CountPerSecond"`, `"BytesPerSecond"`, `"Millisecond"`. Consumers of the collected data expect the collected data values to match this unit. LAD ignores this field. |
| displayName | The label to attach to the data in Azure Monitor Metrics when viewing in the `Guest (classic)` metrics namespace. This label is in the language specified by the associated locale setting. LAD ignores this field. **Note**: If viewing the same metric in the `azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics` Metrics Namespace, which is available if `AzMonSink` is configured, the display name depends entirely on the counter. To find the mapping between counters and names, see [Metrics supported by the builtin provider](#metrics-supported-by-the-builtin-provider). |

The `counterSpecifier` is an arbitrary identifier. Consumers of metrics, like the Azure portal charting and alerting feature, use `counterSpecifier` as the key that identifies a metric or an instance of a metric.

For `builtin` metrics, we recommend `counterSpecifier` values that begin with `/builtin/`. To collect a specific instance of a metric, attach the identifier of the instance to the `counterSpecifier` value. Here are some examples:

- `/builtin/Processor/PercentIdleTime`. Idle time averaged across all vCPUs
- `/builtin/Disk/FreeSpace(/mnt)`. Free space for the `/mnt` file system
- `/builtin/Disk/FreeSpace`. Free space averaged across all mounted file systems

LAD and the Azure portal don't expect the `counterSpecifier` value to match any pattern. Be consistent in how you construct `counterSpecifier` values.

When you specify `performanceCounters`, LAD always writes data to a table in Azure Storage. The same data can be written to JSON blobs or Event Hubs or both. You can't disable storing data to a table.

All instances of LAD that use the same storage account name and endpoint add their metrics and logs to the same table. If too many VMs write to the same table partition, Azure can throttle writes to that partition.

The `eventVolume` setting causes entries to be spread across 1 (small), 10 (medium), or 100 (large) partitions. Usually, medium partitions are sufficient to avoid traffic throttling.

The Azure Monitor Metrics feature of the Azure portal uses the data in this table to produce graphs or to trigger alerts. The table name is the concatenation of these strings:

- `WADMetrics`
- The `"scheduledTransferPeriod"` for the aggregated values stored in the table
- `P10DV2S`
- A date, in the form *YYYYMMDD*, which changes every 10 days

Examples include `WADMetricsPT1HP10DV2S20170410` and `WADMetricsPT1MP10DV2S20170609`.

#### syslogEvents

```json
"syslogEvents": {
    "sinks": "",
    "syslogEventConfiguration": {
        "facilityName1": "minSeverity",
        "facilityName2": "minSeverity",
        ...
    }
}
```

The `syslogEvents` optional section controls the collection of log events from syslog. If the section is omitted, syslog events aren't captured at all.

The `syslogEventConfiguration` collection has one entry for each syslog facility of interest. If `minSeverity` is `"NONE"` for a particular facility, or if that facility doesn't appear in the element at all, no events from that facility are captured.

| Element | Value |
| ------- | -----
sinks | A comma-separated list of names of sinks to which individual log events are published. All log events that match the restrictions in `syslogEventConfiguration` are published to each listed sink. Example: `"EHforsyslog"`
facilityName | A syslog facility name, such as `"LOG_USER"` or `"LOG_LOCAL0"`. For more information, see *Values for facility* in the [syslog manual page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html).
minSeverity | A syslog severity level, such as `"LOG_ERR"` or `"LOG_INFO"`. For more information, see *Values for level* in the [syslog manual page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/syslog.3.html). The extension captures events sent to the facility at or above the specified level.

When you specify `syslogEvents`, LAD always writes data to a table in Azure Storage. The same data can be written to JSON blobs or Event Hubs or both. You can't disable storing data to a table.

The partitioning behavior for this table is the same as described for `performanceCounters`. The table name is the concatenation of these strings:

- `LinuxSyslog`
- A date, in the form *YYYYMMDD*, which changes every 10 days

Examples include `LinuxSyslog20170410` and `LinuxSyslog20170609`.

### sinksConfig

The optional public `sinksConfig` section enables sending metrics to the Azure Monitor sink in addition to the Storage account and the default Guest Metrics view.

> [!NOTE]
> Both public and protected settings have an optional `sinksConfig` section. The `sinksConfig` section in the *public* settings only holds the `AzMonSink` sink configuration. `EventHub` and `JsonBlob` sink configurations **cannot** be included in your public settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The `sinksConfig` section requires system-assigned identity to be enabled on the VMs or virtual machine scale set.
> You can enable system-assigned identity through the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, or Azure Resource Manager. Follow the [detailed instructions](../../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm.md) or see the previous installations samples in this article.

```json
  "sinksConfig": {
    "sink": [
      {
        "name": "AzMonSink",
        "type": "AzMonSink",
        "AzureMonitor": {}
      }
    ]
  },
```

### fileLogs

The `fileLogs` section controls the capture of log files. LAD captures new text lines as they're written to the file. It writes them to table rows and any specified sinks, such as `JsonBlob` and `EventHub`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `fileLogs` are captured by a subcomponent of LAD called `omsagent`. To collect `fileLogs`, ensure that the `omsagent` user has read permissions on the files you specify. It must also have execute permissions on all directories in the path to that file. After LAD is installed, to check permissions, run `sudo su omsagent -c 'cat /path/to/file'`.

```json
"fileLogs": [
    {
        "file": "/var/log/mydaemonlog",
        "table": "MyDaemonEvents",
        "sinks": ""
    }
]
```

| Element | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| file | The full path of the log file to be watched and captured. The path can't specify a directory or contain wildcard characters. The `omsagent` user account must have read access to the file path. |
| table | (Optional) The Azure Storage Table into which new lines from the tail of the file are written. The table must be in the designated storage account, as specified in the protected configuration. |
| sinks | (Optional) A comma-separated list of names of more sinks to which log lines are sent. |

Either `"table"` or `"sinks"` or both must be specified.

## Metrics supported by the builtin provider

The default metrics that LAD supports are aggregated across all file systems, disks, or names. For nonaggregated metrics, refer to the newer Azure Monitor sink metrics support.

> [!NOTE]
> The display names for each metric differ depending on the metrics namespace to which it belongs:
>
> - `Guest (classic)` populated from your storage account: the specified `displayName` in the `performanceCounters` section, or the default display name as seen in Azure Portal. For the VM, under **Monitoring** > **Diagnostic settings**, select **Metrics** tab.
> - `azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics` populated from `AzMonSink`, if configured: the "`azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics` Display Name" specified in the following tables.
>
> The metric values between `Guest (classic)` and `azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics` versions differ. While the classic metrics had certain aggregations applied in the agent, the new metrics are unaggregated counters, giving customers the flexibility to aggregate as desired at viewing/alerting time.

The `builtin` metric provider is a source of metrics that are the most interesting to a broad set of users. These metrics fall into five broad classes:

- Processor
- Memory
- Network
- File system
- Disk

### builtin metrics for the Processor class

The Processor class of metrics provides information about processor usage in the VM. When percentages are aggregated, the result is the average across all CPUs.

In a two-vCPU VM, if one vCPU is 100 percent busy and the other is 100 percent idle, the reported `PercentIdleTime` is 50. If each vCPU is 50 percent busy for the same period, the reported result is also 50. In a four-vCPU VM, when one vCPU is 100 percent busy and the others are idle, the reported `PercentIdleTime` is 75.

| Counter | azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics Display Name | Meaning |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------
| PercentIdleTime | `cpu idle time` | Percentage of time during the aggregation window that processors ran the kernel idle loop |
| PercentProcessorTime |  `cpu percentage guest os` | Percentage of time running a not idle thread |
| PercentIOWaitTime |  `cpu io wait time` | Percentage of time waiting for I/O operations to finish |
| PercentInterruptTime |  `cpu interrupt time` | Percentage of time running hardware or software interrupts and deferred procedure calls (DPCs) |
| PercentUserTime |  `cpu user time` | Of not idle time during the aggregation window, the percentage of time spent in user mode at normal priority |
| PercentNiceTime |  `cpu nice time` | Of not idle time, the percentage spent at lowered (nice) priority |
| PercentPrivilegedTime |  `cpu privileged time` | Of not idle time, the percentage spent in privileged (kernel) mode |

The first four counters should sum to 100 percent. The last three counters also sum to 100 percent. These three counters subdivide the sum of `PercentProcessorTime`, `PercentIOWaitTime`, and `PercentInterruptTime`.

### builtin metrics for the Memory class

The Memory class of metrics provides information about memory use, paging, and swapping.

| Counter | azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics Display Name | Meaning |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| AvailableMemory | `memory available` | Available physical memory in MiB |
| PercentAvailableMemory | `mem. percent available` | Available physical memory as a percentage of total memory |
| UsedMemory | `memory used` | In-use physical memory (MiB) |
| PercentUsedMemory | `memory percentage` | In-use physical memory as a percentage of total memory |
| PagesPerSec | `pages` | Total paging (read/write) |
| PagesReadPerSec | `page reads` | Pages read from the backing store, such as swap file, program file, and mapped file |
| PagesWrittenPerSec | `page writes` | Pages written to the backing store, such as swap file and mapped file |
| AvailableSwap | `swap available` | Unused swap space (MiB) |
| PercentAvailableSwap | `swap percent available` | Unused swap space as a percentage of the total swap |
| UsedSwap | `swap used` | In-use swap space (MiB) |
| PercentUsedSwap | `swap percent used` | In-use swap space as a percentage of the total swap |

This class of metrics has only one instance. The `"condition"` attribute has no useful settings and should be omitted.

### builtin metrics for the Network class

The Network class of metrics provides information about network activity on an individual network interface since the startup.

LAD doesn't expose bandwidth metrics. You can get these metrics from host metrics.

| Counter | azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics Display Name | Meaning |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| BytesTransmitted | `network out guest os` | Total bytes sent since startup |
| BytesReceived | `network in guest os` | Total bytes received since startup |
| BytesTotal | `network total bytes` | Total bytes sent or received since startup |
| PacketsTransmitted | `packets sent` | Total packets sent since startup |
| PacketsReceived | `packets received` | Total packets received since startup |
| TotalRxErrors | `packets received errors` | Number of receive errors since startup |
| TotalTxErrors | `packets sent errors` | Number of transmit errors since startup |
| TotalCollisions | `network collisions` | Number of collisions reported by the network ports since startup |

### builtin metrics for the File system class

The File system class of metrics provides information about file system usage. Absolute and percentage values are reported as they would be displayed to an ordinary user, not root.

| Counter | azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics Display Name | Meaning |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| FreeSpace | `filesystem free space` | Available disk space in bytes |
| UsedSpace | `filesystem used space` | Used disk space in bytes |
| PercentFreeSpace | `filesystem % free space` | Percentage of free space |
| PercentUsedSpace | `filesystem % used space` | Percentage of used space |
| PercentFreeInodes | `filesystem % free inodes` | Percentage of unused index nodes (inodes) |
| PercentUsedInodes | `filesystem % used inodes` | Percentage of allocated (in use) inodes summed across all file systems |
| BytesReadPerSecond | `filesystem read bytes/sec` | Bytes read per second |
| BytesWrittenPerSecond | `filesystem write bytes/sec` | Bytes written per second |
| BytesPerSecond | `filesystem bytes/sec` | Bytes read or written per second |
| ReadsPerSecond | `filesystem reads/sec` | Read operations per second |
| WritesPerSecond | `filesystem writes/sec` | Write operations per second |
| TransfersPerSecond | `filesystem transfers/sec` | Read or write operations per second |

### builtin metrics for the Disk class

The Disk class of metrics provides information about disk device usage. These statistics apply to the entire drive.

When a device has multiple file systems, the counters for that device are, effectively, aggregated across all file systems.

| Counter | azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics Display Name | Meaning |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| ReadsPerSecond | `disk reads` | Read operations per second |
| WritesPerSecond | `disk writes` | Write operations per second |
| TransfersPerSecond | `disk transfers` | Total operations per second |
| AverageReadTime | `disk read time` | Average seconds per read operation |
| AverageWriteTime | `disk write time` | Average seconds per write operation |
| AverageTransferTime | `disk transfer time` | Average seconds per operation |
| AverageDiskQueueLength | `disk queue length` | Average number of queued disk operations |
| ReadBytesPerSecond | `disk read guest os` | Number of bytes read per second |
| WriteBytesPerSecond | `disk write guest os` | Number of bytes written per second |
| BytesPerSecond | `disk total bytes` | Number of bytes read or written per second |

## Example LAD 4.0 configuration

Based on the preceding definitions, this section provides a sample LAD 4.0 extension configuration and some explanation. To apply this sample, use your own storage account name, account shared access signature token, and Event Hubs SAS tokens.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on whether you use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell to install LAD, the method for providing public and protected settings differs:
>
> - If you're using the Azure CLI, save the following settings to *ProtectedSettings.json* and *PublicSettings.json* to use the preceding sample command.
> - If you're using PowerShell, run `$protectedSettings = '{ ... }'` and `$publicSettings = '{ ... }'` to save the following settings to `$protectedSettings` and `$publicSettings`.

### Protected settings configuration

The protected settings configure:

- A storage account.
- A matching account shared access signature token.
- Several sinks: `JsonBlob` or `EventHub` with SAS tokens.

```json
{
  "storageAccountName": "yourdiagstgacct",
  "storageAccountSasToken": "sv=xxxx-xx-xx&ss=bt&srt=co&sp=wlacu&st=yyyy-yy-yyT21%3A22%3A00Z&se=zzzz-zz-zzT21%3A22%3A00Z&sig=fake_signature",
  "sinksConfig": {
    "sink": [
      {
        "name": "SyslogJsonBlob",
        "type": "JsonBlob"
      },
      {
        "name": "FilelogJsonBlob",
        "type": "JsonBlob"
      },
      {
        "name": "LinuxCpuJsonBlob",
        "type": "JsonBlob"
      },
      {
        "name": "MyJsonMetricsBlob",
        "type": "JsonBlob"
      },
      {
        "name": "LinuxCpuEventHub",
        "type": "EventHub",
        "sasURL": "https://youreventhubnamespace.servicebus.windows.net/youreventhubpublisher?sr=https%3a%2f%2fyoureventhubnamespace.servicebus.windows.net%2fyoureventhubpublisher%2f&sig=fake_signature&se=1808096361&skn=yourehpolicy"
      },
      {
        "name": "MyMetricEventHub",
        "type": "EventHub",
        "sasURL": "https://youreventhubnamespace.servicebus.windows.net/youreventhubpublisher?sr=https%3a%2f%2fyoureventhubnamespace.servicebus.windows.net%2fyoureventhubpublisher%2f&sig=yourehpolicy&skn=yourehpolicy"
      },
      {
        "name": "LoggingEventHub",
        "type": "EventHub",
        "sasURL": "https://youreventhubnamespace.servicebus.windows.net/youreventhubpublisher?sr=https%3a%2f%2fyoureventhubnamespace.servicebus.windows.net%2fyoureventhubpublisher%2f&sig=yourehpolicy&se=1808096361&skn=yourehpolicy"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Public settings configuration

The public settings cause LAD to:

- Upload percent-processor-time metrics and used-disk-space metrics to the `WADMetrics*` table.
- Upload messages from syslog facility `"user"` and severity `"info"` to the `LinuxSyslog*` table.
- Upload appended lines in file `/var/log/myladtestlog` to the `MyLadTestLog` table.

In each case, data is also uploaded to:

- Azure Blob Storage. The container name is as defined in the `JsonBlob` sink.
- An Event Hubs endpoint, as specified in the `EventHub` sink.

  ]
}
```

The `resourceId` in the configuration must match that of the VM or the Virtual Machine Scale Set.

- Azure platform metrics charting and alerting knows the `resourceId` of the VM you're working on. It expects to find the data for your VM by using the `resourceId` as the lookup key.
- If you use Azure autoscale, the `resourceId` in the autoscale configuration must match the `resourceId` that LAD uses.
- The `resourceId` is built in to the names of JSON blobs written by LAD.

## View your data

Use the Azure portal to view performance data or set alerts:

:::image type="content" source="./media/diagnostics-linux/graph_metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Metrics page in the Azure portal and Availability selected.":::

The `performanceCounters` data is always stored in an Azure Storage table. Azure Storage APIs are available for many languages and platforms.

Data sent to `JsonBlob` sinks is stored in blobs in the storage account named in the [protected settings](#protected-settings-configuration). You can consume the blob data in any Azure Blob Storage API.

You also can use these UI tools to access the data in Azure Storage:

- Visual Studio Server Explorer
- [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/)

The following screenshot of an Azure Storage Explorer session shows the generated Azure Storage tables and containers from a correctly configured LAD 4.0 extension on a test VM. The image doesn't exactly match the [sample LAD 4.0 configuration](#example-lad-40-configuration).

:::image type="content" source="./media/diagnostics-linux/stg_explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Azure Storage Explorer.":::

For more information about how to consume messages published to an Event Hubs endpoint, see the relevant [Event Hubs documentation](../../event-hubs/event-hubs-about.md).

## Next steps

- In [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-classic-portal.md), create alerts for the metrics you collect.
- [Create monitoring charts](../../azure-monitor/data-platform.md) for your metrics.
- [Create a Virtual Machine Scale Set](../linux/tutorial-create-vmss.md) by using your metrics to control autoscaling.
