# Create a managed disk from a VHD file in a storage account in the same subscription with CLI (Linux)

This script creates a managed disk from a VHD file in a storage account in the same subscription. Use this script to import a specialized (not generalized/sysprepped) VHD to managed OS disk to create a virtual machine. Or, use it to import a data VHD to managed data disk.
