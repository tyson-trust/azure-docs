# Create a managed disk from a snapshot with CLI (Linux)

This article contains two scripts for creating a managed disk from a snapshot. The first script is for a managed disk with platform-managed keys and the second script is for a managed disk with customer-managed keys. Use these scripts to restore a virtual machine from snapshots of OS and data disks. Create OS and data managed disks from respective snapshots and then create a new virtual machine by attaching managed disks. You can also restore data disks of an existing VM by attaching data disks created from snapshots.

## Sample script

### Disks with platform-managed keys

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-managed-disks-from-snapshot/create-managed-disks-from-snapshot.sh" id="FullScript":::

### Disks with customer-managed keys

```azurecli
#Provide the subscription Id of the subscription where you want to create Managed Disks
subscriptionId="<subscriptionId>"

#Provide the name of your resource group
resourceGroupName=myResourceGroupName

#Provide the name of the snapshot that will be used to create Managed Disks
snapshotName=mySnapshotName

#Provide the name of the new Managed Disks that will be create
diskName=myDiskName

#Provide the size of the disks in GB. It should be greater than the VHD file size.
diskSize=128

#Provide the storage type for Managed Disk. Premium_LRS or Standard_LRS.
storageType=Premium_LRS

#Provide the name of the target disk encryption set
diskEncryptionSetName=myName

#Provide the target disk encryption set resource group
diskEncryptionResourceGroup=myGroup

#Required for Premium SSD v2 and Ultra Disks
#Provide the Availability Zone you'd like the disk to be created in, default is 1
zone=1

#Set the context to the subscription Id where Managed Disk will be created
az account set --subscription $subscriptionId

#Get the snapshot Id 
snapshotId=$(az snapshot show --name $snapshotName --resource-group $resourceGroupName --query [id] -o tsv)

#Get the disk encryption set ID
diskEncryptionSetId=$(az disk-encryption-set show --name $diskEncryptionSetName --resource-group $diskEncryptionResourceGroup)

#Create a new Managed Disks using the snapshot Id
#Note that managed disk will be created in the same location as the snapshot
#To change the location, add the --location parameter
#If you're creating a Premium SSD v2 or an Ultra Disk, add "--zone $zone" to the end of the command
az disk create -g $resourceGroupName -n $diskName --source $snapshotId --disk-encryption-set $diskEncryptionSetID --location eastus2euap
```

## Clean up resources

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroupName
```

## Sample reference

This script uses following commands to create a managed disk from a snapshot. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az snapshot show](/cli/azure/snapshot) | Gets all the properties of a snapshot using the name and resource group properties of the snapshot. ID property is used to create managed disk.  |
| [az disk create](/cli/azure/disk) | Creates a managed disk using snapshot ID of a managed snapshot |
