# Use the Azure portal to enable end-to-end encryption using encryption at host

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

When you enable encryption at host, data stored on the VM host is encrypted at rest and flows encrypted to the Storage service. For conceptual information on encryption at host, and other managed disk encryption types, see: [Encryption at host - End-to-end encryption for your VM data](./disk-encryption.md#encryption-at-host---end-to-end-encryption-for-your-vm-data).

Temporary disks and ephemeral OS disks are encrypted at rest with platform-managed keys when you enable end-to-end encryption. The OS and data disk caches are encrypted at rest with either customer-managed or platform-managed keys, depending on what you select as the disk encryption type. For example, if a disk is encrypted with customer-managed keys, then the cache for the disk is encrypted with customer-managed keys, and if a disk is encrypted with platform-managed keys then the cache for the disk is encrypted with platform-managed keys.

## Restrictions

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-restrictions](../../includes/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-restrictions.md)]

### Supported VM sizes

Legacy VM Sizes aren't supported. You can find the list of supported VM sizes by either using the [Azure PowerShell module](windows/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-powershell.md#finding-supported-vm-sizes) or [Azure CLI](linux/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-cli.md#finding-supported-vm-sizes).

## Prerequisites

You must enable the feature for your subscription before you can use encryption at host for either your VM or Virtual Machine Scale Set. Use the following steps to enable the feature for your subscription:

1. **Azure portal**: Select the Cloud Shell icon on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

   ![Screenshot of icon to launch the Cloud Shell from the Azure portal.](./media/disks-enable-host-based-encryption-portal/portal-launch-icon.png)

1. Execute the following command to register the feature for your subscription

   ### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

   ```powershell
   Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "EncryptionAtHost" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Compute"
   ```

   ### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

   ```azurecli
   az feature register --name EncryptionAtHost  --namespace Microsoft.Compute
   ```
   ---

1. Confirm that the registration state is **Registered** (registration may take a few minutes) using the following command before trying out the feature.

   ### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

   ```powershell
   Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "EncryptionAtHost" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Compute"
   ```

   ### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

   ```azurecli
   az feature show --name EncryptionAtHost --namespace Microsoft.Compute
   ```
   ---

## Deploy a VM with platform-managed keys

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Virtual Machines** and select **+ Create** to create a VM.
1. Select an appropriate region and a supported VM size.
1. Fill in the other values on the **Basic** pane as you like, and then proceed to the **Disks** pane.

1. On the **Disks** pane, select **Encryption at host**.
1. Make the remaining selections as you like.

1. For the rest of the VM deployment process, make selections that fit your environment, and complete the deployment.

You've now deployed a VM with encryption at host enabled, and the cache for the disk is encrypted using platform-managed keys.

## Deploy a VM with customer-managed keys

Alternatively, you can use customer-managed keys to encrypt your disk caches.

### Create an Azure Key Vault and disk encryption set

Once the feature is enabled, you need to set up an Azure Key Vault and a disk encryption set, if you haven't already.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-disks-encryption-create-key-vault-portal](../../includes/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-create-key-vault-portal.md)]

### Deploy a VM

Now that you have setup an Azure Key Vault and disk encryption set, you can deploy a VM and it uses encryption at host.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for **Virtual Machines** and select **+ Add** to create a VM.
1. Create a new virtual machine, select an appropriate region and a supported VM size.
1. Fill in the other values on the **Basic** pane as you like, then proceed to the **Disks** pane.

1. On the **Disks** pane, select **Encryption at host**.
1. Select **Key management** and select one of your customer-managed keys.
1. Make the remaining selections as you like.

   :::image type="content" source="media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-host-based-encryption-customer-managed-keys.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual machine creation disks pane, encryption at host is highlighted, customer-managed keys selected." lightbox="media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-host-based-encryption-customer-managed-keys.png":::

1. For the rest of the VM deployment process, make selections that fit your environment, and complete the deployment.

You've now deployed a VM with encryption at host enabled using customer-managed keys.

## Disable host based encryption

Deallocate your VM first, encryption at host can't be disabled unless your VM is deallocated.

1. On your VM, select **Disks** and then select **Additional settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/virtual-machines-disks-encryption-at-host-portal/disks-encryption-host-based-encryption-additional-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Disks pane on a VM, Additional Settings is highlighted.":::

1. Select **No** for **Encryption at host** then select **Save**.
