# What's new in Azure VM Image Builder

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

This article contains all major API changes and feature updates for the Azure VM Image Builder (AIB) service.

## Updates

### April 2023
New portal functionality has been added for Azure Image Builder. Search “Image Templates” in Azure portal, then click “Create”. You can also [get started here](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ImageTemplate) with building and validating custom images inside the portal.

## API releases


### Version 2022-07-01

**Improvements**
- Added support to use the latest image version stored in Azure Compute Gallery as the source for the image template
- Added `versioning` to support generating version numbers for image distributions. For more information, see [properties: versioning](../virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json.md#versioning)
- Added support for per region configuration when distributing to Azure Compute Gallery. For more information, see [Distribute:targetRegions](../virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json.md#distribute-targetregions)
- Added new 'File' validation type. For more information, see [validate properties](../virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json.md#properties-validate)
- VHDs can now be distributed to a custom blob or container in a custom storage account. For more information, see [Distribute: VHD](../virtual-machines/linux/image-builder-json.md#distribute-vhd)
- Added support for using a [Direct Shared Gallery](/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=azure-cli#sharing) image as the source for the image template


**Changes**
- `replicationRegions` is now deprecated for gallery distributions. For more information, use [gallery-replicated-regions](/cli/azure/image/builder/output?view=azure-cli-latest#az-image-builder-output-add-examples&preserve-view=true)
- VHDs can now be distributed to a custom blob or container in a custom storage account
- `targetRegions` array added and applied only to "SharedImage" type distribute. For more information on `targetRegions`, see [Azure Compute Gallery](../../articles/virtual-machines/azure-compute-gallery.md)
- Added support for using a [Direct Shared Gallery](/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries?tabs=azure-cli#sharing) image as the source for the image template. Direct Shared Gallery is currently in preview.
- Triggers are now available in public preview to set up automatic image builds. For more information, see [How to use AIB triggers](./image-builder-triggers-how-to.md)



### Version 2022-02-14

**Improvements**
- [Validation support](./linux/image-builder-json.md#properties-validate)
    - Shell (Linux): Script or inline
    - PowerShell (Windows): Script or inline, run elevated, run as system
    - Source-Validation-Only mode
- [Customized staging resource group support](./linux/image-builder-json.md#properties-stagingresourcegroup)

### Version 2021-10-01

**Breaking change**
 
API version 2021-10-01 introduces a change to the error schema that will be part of every future API release. If you have any Azure VM Image Builder automations, be aware of the [new error output](#error-output-for-version-2021-10-01-and-later) when you switch to API version 2021-10-01 or later. We recommend, after you've switched to the latest API version, that you don't revert to an earlier version, because you'll have to change your automation again to produce the earlier error schema. We don't anticipate that we'll change the error schema again in future releases.

##### **Error output for version 2020-02-14 and earlier**

```
{ 
  "code": "ValidationFailed",
  "message": "Validation failed: 'ImageTemplate.properties.source': Field 'imageId' has a bad value: '/subscriptions/subscriptionID/resourceGroups/resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/imageName'. Please review  http://aka.ms/azvmimagebuildertmplref  for details on fields requirements in the Image Builder Template." 
} 
```

##### **Error output for version 2021-10-01 and later**

```

    "code": "ValidationFailed",

Please review  http://aka.ms/azvmimagebuildertmplref  for details on fields requirements in the Image Builder Template."
