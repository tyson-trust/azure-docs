# NC-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NC and NC_Promo series Azure virtual machines (VMs) will be retired on September 6, 2023. For more information, see the [NC and NC_Promo retirement information](nc-series-retirement.md). For how to migrate your workloads to other VM sizes, see the [GPU compute migration guide](n-series-migration.md).
>
> This retirement announcement doesn't apply to NCv3, NCasT4v3 and NC A100 v4 series VMs.  

NC-series VMs are powered by the [NVIDIA Tesla K80](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/tesla-product-literature/Tesla-K80-BoardSpec-07317-001-v05.pdf) card and the Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 (Haswell) processor. Users can crunch through data faster by using CUDA for energy exploration applications, crash simulations, ray traced rendering, deep learning, and more. The NC24r configuration provides a low latency, high-throughput network interface optimized for tightly coupled parallel computing workloads.

## Supported operating systems and drivers

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, NVIDIA GPU drivers must be installed.

The [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) installs appropriate NVIDIA CUDA or GRID drivers on an N-series VM. Install or manage the extension using the Azure portal or tools such as Azure PowerShell or Azure Resource Manager templates. See the [NVIDIA GPU Driver Extension documentation](./extensions/hpccompute-gpu-windows.md) for supported operating systems and deployment steps. For general information about VM extensions, see [Azure virtual machine extensions and features](./extensions/overview.md).

If you choose to install NVIDIA GPU drivers manually, see [N-series GPU driver setup for Windows](./windows/n-series-driver-setup.md) or [N-series GPU driver setup for Linux](./linux/n-series-driver-setup.md) for supported operating systems, drivers, installation, and verification steps.
