# Dlsv5 and Dldsv5-series 

The Dlsv5 and Dldsv5-series Virtual Machines runs on the Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). The Dlsv5 and Dldsv5 VM series provides 2GiBs of RAM per vCPU and optimized for workloads that require less RAM per vCPU than standard VM sizes. Target workloads include web servers, gaming, video encoding, AI/ML, and batch processing.

## Dlsv5-series
Dlsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.

Dlsv5-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry. You can attach Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.   [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Dldsv5-series

Dldsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz.  These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 192 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 3,600 GiB. These VM sizes can reduce cost when running non-memory intensive applications.  

Dldsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).
