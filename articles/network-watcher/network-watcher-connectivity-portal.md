# Troubleshoot connections with Azure Network Watcher using the Azure portal

In this article, you learn how to use [Azure Network Watcher connection troubleshoot](network-watcher-connectivity-overview.md) to diagnose and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A virtual machine with inbound TCP connectivity from 168.63.129.16 over the port being tested.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Connection troubleshoot requires that the virtual machine you troubleshoot from has the `AzureNetworkWatcherExtension` extension installed. The extension is not required on the destination virtual machine.
> - To install the extension on a Windows VM, see [Azure Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension for Windows](../virtual-machines/extensions/network-watcher-windows.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json).
> - To install the extension on a Linux VM, see [Azure Network Watcher Agent virtual machine extension for Linux](../virtual-machines/extensions/network-watcher-linux.md?toc=%2fazure%2fnetwork-watcher%2ftoc.json).

## Test connectivity between two connected virtual machines

In this section, you test connectivity between two connected virtual machines.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *network watcher*. Select **Network Watcher** in the search results.

1. Under **Network diagnostic tools**, select **Connection troubleshoot**. Enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value  |
    | ------- | ------ |
    | **Source** |  |
    | Subscription | Select your Azure subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | Source type | Select **Virtual machine**. |
    | Virtual machine | Select **VM1**. |
    | **Destination** |  |
    | Destination type | Select **Select a virtual machine**. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | Virtual machine | Select **VM2**. |
    | **Probe Settings** |  |
    | Preferred IP version | Select **IPv4**. |
    | Protocol | Select **TCP**. |
    | Destination port | Enter *80*. |
    | **Connection Diagnostics** |  |
    | Diagnostics tests | Select **Select all**. |

1. Select **Test connection**.

    The test results show that the two virtual machines are communicating with no issues:

    - Network security group rules allow traffic between the two virtual machines.
    - The two virtual machines are directly connected (VM2 is the next hop of VM1).
    - Azure default system route is used to route traffic between the two virtual machines (Route table ID: System route).
    - 66 probes were successfully sent with average latency of 2 ms.

## Troubleshoot connectivity issue between two virtual machines

In this section, you test connectivity between two virtual machines that have connectivity issue.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *network watcher*. Select **Network Watcher** in the search results.

1. Under **Network diagnostic tools**, select **Connection troubleshoot**. Enter or select the following information:

    | Source type | Select **Virtual machine**. |
    | Virtual machine | Select **VM1**. |
    | **Destination** |  |
    | Destination type | Select **Select a virtual machine**. |
    | Resource group | Select **myResourceGroup**. |
    | Virtual machine | Select **VM3**. |
    | **Probe Settings** |  |
    | Preferred IP version | Select **IPv4**. |
    | Protocol | Select **TCP**. |
    | Destination port | Enter *80*. |

    :::image type="content" source="./media/network-watcher-connectivity-portal/test-two-virtual-machines.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Network Watcher connection troubleshoot in Azure portal to test the connection between two virtual machines.":::

1. Select **Test connection**.

    The test results show that the two virtual machines aren't communicating:

    - The two virtual machines aren't connected (no probes were sent from VM1 to VM3).
    - There's no route between the two virtual machines (Next hop type: None).
    - Azure default system route is the route table used (Route table ID: System route).
    - Network security group rules allow traffic between the two virtual machines.

## Test connectivity with `www.bing.com`

In this section, you test connectivity between a virtual machines and `www.bing.com`.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter *network watcher*. Select **Network Watcher** in the search results.

1. Under **Network diagnostic tools**, select **Connection troubleshoot**. Enter or select the following information:
