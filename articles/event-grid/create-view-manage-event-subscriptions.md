### Simplified resource model

The event subscriptions under a [Namespace Topic](concepts-pull-delivery.md#namespace-topics) feature a simplified filtering configuration model when compared to that of event subscriptions to domains and to custom, system, partner, and domain topics. The filtering capabilities are the same except for the scenarios documented in the following sections.

#### Filter on event data

Filtering on event `data` isn't currently supported. This capability will be available in a future release.

#### Subject begins with

There's no dedicated configuration properties to specify filters on `subject`. You can configure filters in the following way to filter the context attribute `subject` with a value that begins with a string.

| key value  | operator   |   value |
|-----------|:---------:|-----------|
|  subject  |  String begins with   |  **your string**  |

#### Subject ends with

There's no dedicated configuration properties to specify filters on `subject`. You can configure filters in the following way to filter the context attribute `subject` with a value that ends with a string.

| key value  | operator   |   value |
|-----------|:---------:|-----------|
|  subject  |  String ends with   |  **your string**  |
