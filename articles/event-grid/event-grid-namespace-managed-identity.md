# Enabling managed identity for Event Grid namespace
In this article, you learn how to assign a system-assigned or a user-assigned identity to an Event Grid namespace. To learn about managed identities in general, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - You can assign one system-assigned identity and up to two user-assigned identities to a namespace.
