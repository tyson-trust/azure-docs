# Onboard as an Azure Event Grid partner using the Azure portal
This article describes the way third-party SaaS providers, also known as [partners](concepts.md#partners) are onboarded to Event Grid to be able to publish events from their services and how those events are consumed by end users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Partners can publish events to Azure Event Grid, and also receive events from it. These capabilities are enabled through the [Partner Events](partner-events-overview.md) feature. If you aren't familiar with Partner Events, see [Partner Events overview](partner-events-overview-for-partners.md) for a detailed introduction of key concepts that are critical to understand and follow the steps in this article.

## Onboarding process for partners
In a nutshell, enabling your service’s events to be consumed by users typically involves the following process:

1. [Communicate your interest in becoming a partner](#communicate-your-interest-in-becoming-a-partner) to the Event Grid service team.
1. [Register the Event Grid resource provider](#register-the-event-grid-resource-provider) with your Azure subscription.
1. [Create a **partner registration**](#create-a-partner-registration). 
1. [Create a **namespace**](#create-a-partner-namespace).
1. [Create a **channel** and a **partner topic** in a single step](#create-a-channel).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You may be able to create an event channel (legacy), which supports partner topics. **Channel** is the new routing resource type and is the preferred option, which supports both sending events via partner topics. An **event channel** is a legacy resource and will be deprecated soon. 
1. Test the Partner Events functionality end to end.

For step #5, you should decide what kind of user experience you want to provide. You have the following options:
- Provide your own solution, typically a web graphical user interface (GUI) experience, hosted under your domain using our SDK and/or REST API to create a channel (latest and recommended) /event channel (legacy) and its corresponding partner topic. With this option, you can ask the user for the subscription and resource group under which you'll create a partner topic.
- Use Azure portal or CLI to create the channel (recommended)/event channel (legacy) and an associated partner topic. With this option, you must have get in the user’s Azure subscription some way and resource group under which you'll create a partner topic. 

This article shows you how to **onboard as an Azure Event Grid partner** using the **Azure portal**. 

## Communicate your interest in becoming a partner

            > [!IMPORTANT]
            > - It's not possible to update the routing mode once the namespace is created.             
            > - **Channel** is the new routing resource type and is the preferred option. An event channel is a legacy resource and will be deprecated soon.
