# Pull delivery with HTTP (Preview)
This article builds on [What is Azure Event Grid?](overview.md) to provide essential information before you start using Event Grid’s pull delivery over HTTP. It covers fundamental concepts, resource models, and message delivery modes supported. At the end of this document, you find useful links to articles that guide you on how to use Event Grid and to articles that offer in-depth conceptual information.

>[!NOTE]
> This document helps you get started with Event Grid capabilities that use the HTTP protocol. This article is suitable for users who need to integrate applications on the cloud. If you require to communicate IoT device data, see [Overview of the MQTT Support in Azure Event Grid](mqtt-overview.md).

## Core concepts

### CloudEvents

Event Grid conforms to CNCF’s open standard [CloudEvents 1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec) specification using the [HTTP protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md) with [JSON format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/json-format.md). This means that your solutions publish and consume event messages using a format like the following example:

```json
{
    "specversion" : "1.0",
    "type" : "com.yourcompany.order.created",
    "source" : "https://yourcompany.com/orders/",
    "subject" : "O-28964",
    "id" : "A234-1234-1234",
    "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
    "comexampleextension1" : "value",
    "comexampleothervalue" : 5,
    "datacontenttype" : "application/json",
    "data" : {
       "orderId" : "O-28964",
       "URL" : "https://com.yourcompany/orders/O-28964"
    }
}
```

#### What is an event?

An **event** is the smallest amount of information that fully describes something that happened in a system. We often refer to an event as shown above as a discrete event because it represents a distinct, self-standing fact about a system that provides an insight that can be actionable. Examples include: *com.yourcompany.Orders.OrderCreated*, *org.yourorg.GeneralLedger.AccountChanged*, *io.solutionname.Auth.MaximumNumberOfUserLoginAttemptsReached*.

>[!Note]
> We interchangeably use the terms **discrete events**, **cloudevents**, or just **events** to refer to those messages that inform about a change of a system state. 

For more information on events, see Event Grid [Terminology](concepts.md#events).

#### Another kind of event

The user community also refers to events to those type of messages that carry a data point, such as a single reading from a device or a single click on a web application page. That kind of event is usually analyzed over a time window or event stream size to derive insights and take an action. In Event Grid’s documentation, we refer to that kind of event as **data point**, **streaming data**, or **telemetry**. They're a kind of data that Event Grid’s MQTT support and Azure Event Hubs usually handle.

### Topics and event subscriptions

Events published to Event Grid land on a **topic**, which is a resource that logically contains all events. An **event subscription** is a configuration resource associated with a single topic. Among other things, you use an event subscription to set event selection criteria to define the event collection available to a subscriber out of the total set of events present in a topic.

## Push and pull delivery

Using HTTP, Event Grid supports push and pull event delivery. With **push delivery**, you define a destination in an event subscription, a webhook or an Azure service, to which Event Grid sends events. Push delivery is supported in custom topics, system topics, domain topics and partner topics. With **pull delivery**, subscriber applications connect to Event Grid to consume events. Pull delivery is supported in topics within a namespace.

### When to use push delivery vs. pull delivery 

The following are general guidelines to help you decide when to use pull or push delivery.

#### Pull delivery

- Your applications or services publish events. Event Grid doesn't yet support pull delivery when the source of the events is an [Azure service](event-schema-api-management.md?tabs=cloud-event-schema) or a [partner](partner-events-overview.md) (SaaS) system.
- You need full control as to when to receive events. For example, your application may not up all the time, not stable enough, or you process data at certain times.
- You need full control over event consumption. For example, a downstream service or layer in your consumer application has a problem that prevents you from processing events. In that case, the pull delivery API allows the consumer app to release an already read event back to the broker so that it can be delivered later.
- You want to use [private links](../private-link/private-endpoint-overview.md) when receiving events. This is possible with pull delivery.
- You don't have the ability to expose an endpoint and use push delivery, but you can connect to Event Grid to consume events.

#### Push delivery
- You need to receive events from Azure services, partner (SaaS) event sources or from your applications. Push delivery supports these types of event sources. 
- You want to avoid constant polling to determine that a system state change has occurred. You rather use Event Grid to send events to you at the time state changes happen.
- You have an application that can't make outbound calls. For example, your organization may be concerned about data exfiltration. However, your application can receive events through a public endpoint.

## Pull delivery
Pull delivery is available through [namespace topics](concepts.md#topics), which are topics that you create inside a [namespace](concepts-pull-delivery.md#namespaces). Your application publishes CloudEvents to a single namespace HTTP endpoint specifying the target topic.

>[!Note]
> - Namespaces provide a simpler resource model featuring a single kind of topic. Currently, Event Grid supports publishing your own application events through namespace topics. You cannot consume events from Azure services or partner SaaS systems using namespace topics. You also cannot create system topics, domain topics or partner topics in a namespace.
>- Key-based (local) authentication is currently supported for namespace topics.
>- Namespace topics support CloudEvents JSON format.

You use an event subscription to define the filtering criteria for events and in doing so, you effectively define the set of events that are available for consumption. One or more subscriber (consumer) applications connect to the same namespace endpoint specifying the topic and event subscription from which to receive events.

:::image type="content" source="media/pull-and-push-delivery-overview/pull-delivery.png" alt-text="High-level diagram of a publisher and consumer using an event subscription. Consumer uses pull delivery." lightbox="media/pull-and-push-delivery-overview/pull-delivery-high-res.png" border="false":::

One or more consumers connects to Event Grid to receive events.

- A **receive** operation is used to read one or more events using a single request to Event Grid. The broker waits for up to 60 seconds for events to become available. For example new events available because they were just published. A successful receive request returns zero or more events. If events are available, it returns as many available events as possible up to the event count requested. Event Grid also returns a lock token for every event read.
- A **lock token** is a kind of handle that identifies an event for event state control purposes.
- Once a consumer application receives an event and processes it, it  **acknowledges** the event. This instructs Event Grid to delete the event so it isn't redelivered to another client. The consumer application acknowledges one or more tokens with a single request by specifying their lock tokens before they expire.

In some other occasions, your consumer application may want to release or reject events.

- Your consumer application **releases** a received event to signal Event Grid that it isn't ready to process the event and to make it available for redelivery.
- You may want to **reject** an event if there's a condition, possibly permanent, that prevents your consumer application to process the event. For example, a malformed message can be rejected as it can't be successfully parsed. Rejected events are dead-lettered, if a dead-letter destination is available. Otherwise, they're dropped.
