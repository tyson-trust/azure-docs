## <a name="connect"></a>Connectivity services
 
This section describes services that provide connectivity between Azure resources, connectivity from an on-premises network to Azure resources, and branch to branch connectivity in Azure - Virtual Network (VNet), ExpressRoute, VPN Gateway, Virtual WAN, Virtual network NAT Gateway, Azure DNS, Peering service, Route Server, and Azure Bastion.

### <a name="vnet"></a>Virtual network

[Azure Virtual Network (VNet)](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. You can use VNets to:
- **Communicate between Azure resources**: You can deploy virtual machines, and several other types of Azure resources to a virtual network, such as Azure App Service Environments, the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets. To view a complete list of Azure resources that you can deploy into a virtual network, see [Virtual network service integration](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-for-azure-services.md).
- **Communicate between each other**: You can connect virtual networks to each other, enabling resources in either virtual network to communicate with each other, using virtual network peering or Azure Virtual Network Manager. The virtual networks you connect can be in the same, or different, Azure regions. For more information, see [Virtual network peering](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview.md) and [Azure Virtual Network Manager](../../virtual-network-manager/overview.md).
- **Communicate to the internet**: All resources in a VNet can communicate outbound to the internet, by default. You can communicate inbound to a resource by assigning a public IP address or a public Load Balancer. You can also use [Public IP addresses](../../virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address.md) or public [Load Balancer](../../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md) to manage your outbound connections.
- **Communicate with on-premises networks**: You can connect your on-premises computers and networks to a virtual network using [VPN Gateway](../../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) or [ExpressRoute](../../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

### <a name="avnm"></a>Azure Virtual Network Manager

[Azure Virtual Network Manager](../../virtual-network-manager/overview.md) is a management service that enables you to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual networks globally across subscriptions. With Virtual Network Manager, you can define [network groups](../../virtual-network-manager/concept-network-groups.md) to identify and logically segment your virtual networks. Then you can determine the [connectivity](../../virtual-network-manager/concept-connectivity-configuration.md) and [security configurations](../../virtual-network-manager/concept-security-admins.md) you want and apply them across all the selected virtual networks in network groups at once.
