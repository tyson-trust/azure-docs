On March 31, 2023, we retired support for Azure SDK libraries which do not conform to the [current Azure SDK guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html). The new Azure SDK libraries are updated regularly to drive consistent experiences and strengthen your security posture. It's recommended that you transition to the new Azure SDK libraries to take advantage of the new capabilities and critical security updates.  

Although the older libraries can still be used beyond March 31, 2023, they'll no longer receive official support and updates from Microsoft. For more information, see the [support retirement announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/support-for-azure-sdk-libraries-that-do-not-conform-to-our-current-azure-sdk-guidelines-will-be-retired-as-of-31-march-2023/).
