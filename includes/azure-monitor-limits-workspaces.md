| [Legacy Free tier](../articles/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs.md#free-trial-pricing-tier)<br>(introduced April 2016) | 500 MB | 7 days | When your workspace reaches the 500-MB-per-day limit, data ingestion stops and resumes at the start of the next day. A day is based on UTC. Data collected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud isn't included in this 500-MB-per-day limit and continues to be collected above this limit. Creating new workspaces in, or moving existing workspaces into, the legacy Free Trial pricing tier is possible only until July 1, 2022.  |

<b id="data-ingestion-volume-rate">Data ingestion volume rate</b>

Azure Monitor is a high-scale data service that serves thousands of customers sending terabytes of data each month at a growing pace. The volume rate limit intends to isolate Azure Monitor customers from sudden ingestion spikes in a multitenancy environment. A default ingestion volume rate threshold of 500 MB (compressed) is defined in workspaces. This rate is translated to approximately 6 GB/min uncompressed. The actual size can vary between data types depending on the log length and its compression ratio.

The volume rate limit applies to data ingested from Azure resources via [Diagnostic settings](../articles/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md). When the volume rate limit is reached, a retry mechanism attempts to ingest the data four times in a period of 30 minutes and drop it if operation fails. It doesn't apply to data ingested from [agents](../articles/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md) or the [Data Collector API](../articles/azure-monitor/logs/data-collector-api.md).

When data sent to your workspace is at a volume rate higher than 80% of the threshold configured in your workspace, an event is sent to the `Operation` table in your workspace every 6 hours while the threshold continues to be exceeded.

When the ingested volume rate is higher than the threshold, some data is dropped. An event is sent to the `Operation` table in your workspace every 6 hours while the threshold continues to be exceeded. If your ingestion volume rate continues to exceed the threshold or you're expecting to reach it sometime soon, you can request to increase it by opening a support request.

See [Monitor health of Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor](../articles/azure-monitor/logs/monitor-workspace.md) to create alert rules to be proactively notified when you reach any ingestion limits.

>[!NOTE]
>Depending on how long you've been using Log Analytics, you might have access to legacy pricing tiers. Learn more about [Log Analytics legacy pricing tiers](../articles/azure-monitor/logs/cost-logs.md#legacy-pricing-tiers).
