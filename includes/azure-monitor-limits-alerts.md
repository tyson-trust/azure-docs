### Alerts API
Azure Monitor alerts have several throttling limits to protect against users making an excessive number of calls. Such behavior can potentially overload the system back-end resources and jeopardize service responsiveness. The following limits are designed to protect customers from interruptions and ensure a consistent service level. The user throttling and limits are designed to affect only extreme usage scenarios. They shouldn't be relevant for typical usage.
>[!Note]
>There is a limit of API calls per instance. The exact limit number depands on the number of instances.
