>[!NOTE]
>Currently, Azure Digital Twins Explorer fully supports DTDL v2 models and supports limited functionality for DTDL v3 models, including viewing DTDL v3 models in the Models panel and viewing/editing twins created with DTDL v3 models (including those with array properties). However, DTDL v3 models won't show up in the Model Graph panel, and they can't be imported using Azure Digital Twins Explorer. To import DTDL v3 models to your instance, use another developer interface like the [APIs and SDKs](../articles/digital-twins/concepts-apis-sdks.md) or the [Azure CLI](../articles/digital-twins/concepts-cli.md).
