> [!TIP]
> The content in this article applies to the original Azure Table storage. However, the same concepts apply to the newer Azure Cosmos DB for Table, which offers higher performance and availability, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. It is also available in a consumption-based [serverless](../articles/cosmos-db/serverless.md) mode. There are some [feature differences](../articles/cosmos-db/table/introduction.md) between Table API in Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Table storage. For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB for Table](../articles/cosmos-db/table-introduction.md). For ease of development, we now provide a unified [Azure Tables SDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/announcing-the-new-azure-data-tables-libraries/) that can be used to target both Azure Table storage and Azure Cosmos DB for Table.
