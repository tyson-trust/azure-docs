Here are the limits on the size of the data that's copied into a storage account. Make sure the data you upload conforms to these limits. For the most up-to-date information on these limits, see [Scalability and performance targets for Blob storage](../articles/storage/blobs/scalability-targets.md) and [Azure Files scalability and performance targets](../articles/storage/files/storage-files-scale-targets.md). 

| Size of data copied into Azure storage account                      | Default limit          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Block blob and page blob                                            | Maximum limit is the same as the [Storage limit defined for Azure Subscription](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits.md#azure-storage-limits) and it includes data from all the sources including Data Box.   |
| Azure Files                                                          | <ul><li>Data Box supports large file shares (100 TiB) if enabled before creation of the Data Box order.<ul><li>If large file shares are not enabled before order creation, maximum file share size supported is 5 TiB.</li><li>To improve performance during data uploads, we recommend that you [enable large file shares on the storage account and increase share capacity to 100 TiB](../articles/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md#enable-large-file-shares-on-an-existing-account). Large file shares are only supported for storage accounts with locally redundant storage (LRS).</li></ul><li>Data Box supports Azure Premium File Shares, which allow a total of 100 TiB for all shares in the storage account.<ul><li>Maximum usable capacity is slightly less because of the space that copy logs and audit logs use. A minimum 100 GiB each is reserved for the copy log and audit log. For more information, see [Audit logs for Azure Data Box, Azure Data Box Heavy](../articles/databox/data-box-audit-logs.md).</li><li>All folders under *StorageAccount_AzFile* must follow this limit. For more information, see [Create an Azure file share](../articles/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share.md).</li></ul></li></ul> |
