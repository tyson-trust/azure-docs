> [!NOTE]
> For web workloads, we highly recommend utilizing [**Azure DDoS protection**](../articles/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview.md) and a [**web application firewall**](../articles/web-application-firewall/overview.md) to safeguard against emerging DDoS attacks. Another option is to employ [**Azure Front Door**](../articles/frontdoor/web-application-firewall.md) along with a web application firewall. Azure Front Door offers [**platform-level protection**](../articles/frontdoor/front-door-ddos.md) against network-level DDoS attacks. For more information, see [**security baseline for Azure services**](/security/benchmark/azure/security-baselines-overview).
