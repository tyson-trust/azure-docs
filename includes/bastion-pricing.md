Hourly pricing starts from the moment Bastion is deployed, regardless of outbound data usage. For more information, see [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-bastion/) and [SKUs](../articles/bastion/configuration-settings.md#skus). If you're deploying Bastion as part of a tutorial or test, we recommend that you delete this resource once you've finished using it.
