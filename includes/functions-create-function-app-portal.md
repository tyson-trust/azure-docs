1. From the Azure portal menu or the **Home** page, select **Create a resource**.

1. In the **New** page, select **Compute** > **Function App**.

1. On the **Basics** page, use the function app settings as specified in the following table:

    | Setting      | Suggested value  | Description |
    | ------------ | ---------------- | ----------- |
    | **Subscription** | Your subscription | The subscription under which you create your new function app. |
    | **[Resource Group](../articles/azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md)** |  *myResourceGroup* | Name for the new resource group in which you create your function app. You should create a new resource group because there are [known limitations when creating new function apps in an existing resource group](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md#limitations-for-creating-new-function-apps-in-an-existing-resource-group).|
    | **Function App name** | Globally unique name | Name that identifies your new function app. Valid characters are `a-z` (case insensitive), `0-9`, and `-`.  |
    |**Do you want to deploy code or container image?**| Code | Option to publish code files or a [Docker container](../articles/azure-functions/functions-how-to-custom-container.md). |
    | **Runtime stack** | Preferred language | Choose a runtime that supports your favorite function programming language. In-portal editing is only available for JavaScript, PowerShell, Python v1, TypeScript, and C# script. C# class library, Java, and Python v2 functions must be [developed locally](../articles/azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md#local-development-environments).  |
    |**Version**| Version number | Choose the version of your installed runtime. |
    |**Region**| Preferred region | Select a [region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/) that's near you or near other services that your functions can access. |
    |**Operating system**| Windows | An operating system is preselected for you based on your runtime stack selection, but you can change the setting if necessary. In-portal editing is only supported on Windows. Container publishing is only supported on Linux. |
    | **[Hosting options and plans](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md)** | **Consumption (Serverless)** | Hosting plan that defines how resources are allocated to your function app. In the default **Consumption** plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions. In this [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/serverless-computing/) hosting, you pay only for the time your functions run. [Premium plan](../articles/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan.md) also offers dynamic scaling. When you run in an App Service plan, you must manage the [scaling of your function app](../articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md).  |

1. Accept the default options of creating a new storage account on the **Storage** tab and a new Application Insight instance on the **Monitoring** tab. You can also choose to use an existing storage account or Application Insights instance.

1. Select **Review + create** to review the app configuration you chose, and then select **Create** to provision and deploy the function app.

1. Select the **Notifications** icon in the upper-right corner of the portal and watch for the **Deployment succeeded** message.

1. Select **Go to resource** to view your new function app. You can also select **Pin to dashboard**. Pinning makes it easier to return to this function app resource from your dashboard.
