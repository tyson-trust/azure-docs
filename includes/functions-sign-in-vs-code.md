## Sign in to Azure

Before you can publish your app, you must sign in to Azure.

    If you're already signed in and can see your existing subscriptions, go to the next section. If you don't yet have an Azure account, choose **Create an Azure Account...**. Students can choose **Create an Azure for Students Account...**.

2. When prompted in the browser, choose your Azure account and sign in using your Azure account credentials. If you create a new account, you can sign in after your account is created.

3. After you've successfully signed in, you can close the new browser window. The subscriptions that belong to your Azure account are displayed in the sidebar.
