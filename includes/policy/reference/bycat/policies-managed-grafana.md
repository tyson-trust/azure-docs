|[Azure Managed Grafana should use private link](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F3a97e513-f75e-4230-8137-1efad4eadbbc) |Azure Private Link lets you connect your virtual networks to Azure services without a public IP address at the source or destination. The Private Link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to Managed Grafana, you can reduce data leakage risks. |Audit, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Managed%20Grafana/AMG_PrivateEndpoints_Audit.json) |
|[Azure Managed Grafana workspaces should disable public network access](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fe8775d5a-73b7-4977-a39b-833ef0114628) |Disabling public network access improves security by ensuring that your Azure Managed Grafana workspace isn't exposed on the public internet. Creating private endpoints can limit exposure of your workspaces. |Audit, Deny, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Managed%20Grafana/AMG_PublicNetworkAccess_Deny.json) |

This can reduce data leakage risks. |Modify, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Managed%20Grafana/AMG_PublicNetworkAccess_Modify.json) |
|[Configure Azure Managed Grafana workspaces to use private DNS zones](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F4c8537f8-cd1b-49ec-b704-18e82a42fd58) |Use private DNS zones to override the DNS resolution for a private endpoint. A private DNS zone links to your virtual network to resolve to Azure Managed Grafana workspaces. |DeployIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Managed%20Grafana/AMG_PrivateDNSZone_DeployIfNotExists.json) |
