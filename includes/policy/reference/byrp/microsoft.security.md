|[\[Preview\]: API endpoints in Azure API Management should be authenticated](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F8ac833bd-f505-48d5-887e-c993a1d3eea0) |API endpoints published within Azure API Management should enforce authentication to help minimize security risk. Authentication mechanisms are sometimes implemented incorrectly or are missing. This allows attackers to exploit implementation flaws and to access data. Learn More about the OWASP API Threat for Broken User Authentication here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/mitigate-owasp-api-threats#broken-user-authentication](../../../../articles/api-management/mitigate-owasp-api-threats.md#broken-user-authentication) |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_APIMApiEndpointsShouldbeAuthenticated_AuditIfNotExists.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: API endpoints that are unused should be disabled and removed from the Azure API Management service](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fc8acafaf-3d23-44d1-9624-978ef0f8652c) |As a security best practice, API endpoints that haven't received traffic for 30 days are considered unused and should be removed from the Azure API Management service. Keeping unused API endpoints may pose a security risk to your organization. These may be APIs that should have been deprecated from the Azure API Management service but may have been accidentally left active. Such APIs typically do not receive the most up to date security coverage. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_APIMUnusedApiEndpointsShouldbeRemoved_AuditIfNotExists.json) |

Defender for Cloud has identified untrusted OS boot components on one or more of your Linux machines. To protect your machines from potentially malicious components, add them to your allow list or remove the identified components. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_BootComponent_Signature_Linux_Audit.json) |
|[\[Preview\]: Linux virtual machines should use Secure Boot](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2Fb1bb3592-47b8-4150-8db0-bfdcc2c8965b) |To protect against the installation of malware-based rootkits and boot kits, enable Secure Boot on supported Linux virtual machines. Secure Boot ensures that only signed operating systems and drivers will be allowed to run. This assessment only applies to Linux virtual machines that have the Azure Monitor Agent installed. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_EnableSecureBootOnLinuxVM_Audit.json) |

The exposed ports identified by this recommendation need to be closed for your continued security. For each identified port, the recommendation also provides an explanation of the potential threat. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_OpenTOUPortsOnVirtualMachines_Audit.json) |

Software updates often include critical patches to security holes. Such holes are frequently exploited in malware attacks so it's vital to keep your software updated. To install all outstanding patches and secure your machines, follow the remediation steps. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_MissingSystemUpdatesV2_Audit.json) |

The server uses these logs to determine whether boot components are trustworthy. This assessment is intended to detect compromises of the boot chain which might be the result of a bootkit or rootkit infection. This assessment only applies to Trusted Launch enabled virtual machines that have Guest Attestation extension installed. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[1.0.0-preview](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_BootIntegrityAttestation_Audit.json) |

This helps harden your machines against malware. To simplify the process of configuring and maintaining your rules, Security Center uses machine learning to analyze the applications running on each machine and suggest the list of known-safe applications. |AuditIfNotExists, Disabled |[3.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Security%20Center/ASC_AdaptiveApplicationControls_Audit.json) |
