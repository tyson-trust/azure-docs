Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition, such as text or binary data.

## About Blob Storage

Blob Storage is designed for:

* Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
* Storing files for distributed access.
* Streaming video and audio.
* Writing to log files.
* Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
* Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.

Users or client applications can access objects in Blob Storage via HTTP/HTTPS, from anywhere in the world. Objects in Blob Storage are accessible via the [Azure Storage REST API](/rest/api/storageservices/blob-service-rest-api), [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/module/az.storage), [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/storage), or an Azure Storage client library. Client libraries are available for different languages, including:

* [.NET](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage)
* [Java](/java/api/overview/azure/storage)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/storage)
* [Python](../articles/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python.md)
* [Go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/main/sdk/storage/azblob)

Clients can also securely connect to Blob Storage by using SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and mount Blob Storage containers by using the Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol.
