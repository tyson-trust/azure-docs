|[\[Enable if required\] Azure Cosmos DB accounts should use customer-managed keys to encrypt data at rest](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/814df446-7128-eff0-9177-fa52ac035b74) |Recommendations to use customer-managed keys for encryption of data at rest are not assessed by default, but are available to enable for applicable scenarios. Data is encrypted automatically using platform-managed keys, so the use of customer-managed keys should only be applied when obligated by compliance or restrictive policy requirements. <br> To enable this recommendation, navigate to your Security Policy for the applicable scope, and update the *Effect* parameter for the corresponding policy to audit or enforce the use of customer-managed keys.

The private link platform handles the connectivity between the consumer and services over the Azure backbone network. By mapping private endpoints to your app configuration instances instead of the entire service, you'll also be protected against data leakage risks.

Data is collected by the Log Analytics agent, formerly known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your Log Analytics workspace for analysis.
