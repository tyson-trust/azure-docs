Have a valid carrier account and a tracking number for the order:
- You must use a carrier in the **Carrier names** list on the **Shipping** tab for your order. If you don't have a carrier account, contact the carrier to create one.
- The carrier account must be valid, should have a balance, and must have return shipping capabilities. Microsoft will ship back all storage media using the selected carrier.<!--If I remove "back," same prerequisites can be shared with imports and exports. May not even need to do that.-->
- Generate a tracking number for the import/export job in the carrier account. Every job should have a separate tracking number. Multiple jobs with the same tracking number aren't supported.
