When you want the function to write a single event, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | The event as a string. Use when the event is simple text. |
| `byte[]` | The bytes of the event. |
| JSON serializable types | An object representing the event. Functions tries to serialize a plain-old CLR object (POCO) type into JSON data. |

When you want the function to write multiple events, the Event Hubs output binding can bind to the following types:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `T[]` where `T` is one of the single event types | An array containing multiple events. Each entry represents one event. | 

For other output scenarios, create and use types from [Microsoft.Azure.EventHubs] directly.
