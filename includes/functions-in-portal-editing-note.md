>[!NOTE]
>In-portal editing is only supported for JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and C# Script functions. Python in-portal editing is only supported when running in the Consumption plan and using the Python v1 programming model.   
>In-portal editing is currently only supported for functions that were created or last modified in the portal. When you deploy code to a function app from outside the portal, you can no longer edit any of the code for that function app in the portal. In this case, just continue using [local development](../articles/azure-functions/functions-develop-local.md). 
>For compiled C# functions, Java functions, and other Python functions, you can create the function app in the portal, but you must also create the functions code project locally and then publish it to Azure.
