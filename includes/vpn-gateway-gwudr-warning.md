User-defined routes with a 0.0.0.0/0 destination and NSGs on the GatewaySubnet **are not supported**. Gateways with this configuration are blocked from being created. Gateways require access to the management controllers in order to function properly. [BGP route propagation](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md#border-gateway-protocol) should be set to "Enabled" on the GatewaySubnet to ensure availability of the gateway. If BGP route propagation is set to disabled, the gateway won't function.
